0,[Rant] Transgender Discrimination in Singapore Schools and MOE's denial of mental health issues,"Note: I am posting this on a throwaway as I am an active redditor to avoid disclosing my main account containing information that I'd like to not reveal. However, some of you may know who I am.

Having been essentially barred from returning to lessons in my government MOE school, I have become a target of the MOE. To give a bit of background, I am transgender male-to-female, using she/her pronouns. I used to attend an all-boys' primary school and it was the worst period of my life - I couldn't fit in and constantly got bullied because I was 'too soft' and 'needed to man up to the bullies'. Despite being there, I always wanted to dress like girls, have a typical female hairstyle etc. Things took a turn ever since I entered a co-ed secondary school; I started making more friends and understanding my identity. I was then taken to the gender clinic at the IMH. However, since getting a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria from the IMH, my schooling life in the MOE system has gone from great to utter trash, pretty much forcing me to transfer from my current school to a polytechnic course which is not really ideal and not exactly in line with what ambitions I had in mind.
(Gender dysphoria is listed as a disorder under Gender identity disorders in the ICD-10 by the WHO)

Here's a timeline: ever since getting the diagnosis, I informed the MOE of it through my JC, and the reply from the MOE according to my school's administration was simply that 'This is a new issue and we would like to work with you to learn more about it.'
All was well for several months, though rules were vague given that I had a proper diagnosis from a qualified doctor. My classmates and subject tutors are highly supportive.
Then, as I was about to undergo hormone therapy (a treatment explicitly stated in the ICD-10, again, and recommended by the multiple doctors attending to trans patients in Singapore) the request was suddenly blocked as the MOE had intervened, apparently for the reason 'students in MOE schools are under our control, and we have every right and say over their treatment'. This meant that my doctor had to call off the referral, causing me further mental trauma as this affected my ability to pass and present as a female. Alongside this, I was informed that I had to cut my hair to fit the boys' hairstyle in the handbook, and that I was specifically to wear the male uniform; that could probably have slipped under the radar but it seems unlikely as all these troubles started in the same month. In addition, if I became unable to fit in the boys' uniform if I somehow got hormone therapy, I would be expelled from school, instead of being allowed to wear the female uniform. The principal's explanation for this was that 'due to your presentation, you would be as disruptive to the school environment as a student with severe autism'.

What right does the MOE have over the MOH? Why is the MOE interfering with my medical care, and the irony of [MOE advocating for mental health issues](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/mental-health). I cannot speak for others, but in my experience, these are outright lies and just a farce to gain support from the younger generations of students.

Update: MOE has posted a complete [denial](https://i.imgur.com/8WcQGMB.png) of this issue on Facebook. That is an outright lie, contradicts what I was told by my doctor, and I am sure my classmates can vouch for me. In addition, they do not respect my pronouns and instead intentionally misgendered me (against the advice and recommendations)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwqqdu/rant_transgender_discrimination_in_singapore/,True,2021-01-14 13:44:37
1,[Uni] Why I Disliked Being in NUS Dentistry (Advice for Future Applicants)," 

Firstly, it might sound incredulous to many of you, but the NUS Dentistry is an incredibly oppressive place to be in. Students are expected to fall in line. Those who attract attention get themselves in trouble. I’ve often heard from my friends in medicine about how they are able to feedback to the school about the problems they face. I find it incredibly hard to see the day where the Faculty of Dentistry entertains student feedback. Every year, the school asks its students for feedback, and almost every year, student feedback participation is incredibly low. The school blames the students for being lazy and unresponsive, but has the school ever asked itself why this is so? Perhaps it is because students have realised that their feedback doesn’t even matter. Why would we feedback, when none of it is taken into consideration? Why should we respond to a survey that is dismissed by lecturers and supervisors who repeat the same cycle of top-down instruction every year?

Secondly, students and even junior staff are often called upon to respect the hierarchy. Even if you’re right, you’re wrong as long as your opinion clashes with someone who is more senior than you. I was taught to keep my head down in school, and so I did. Every time I was shouted at, scolded, spoken to like I’m a worthless bottom-feeder, I took the beating and laid low. To be fair, that kept me out of the radar just enough for me to slip out under. Afterall, none of us escape this place without getting scuffed up a little. It was a small price to pay to get out. I never really got the brunt of the beating, but some of my classmates were less fortunate. Those who challenged those in charge were punished, and they had their lives made difficult and some were retained as a result.

Thirdly, the school is a political minefield. Tensions exist within the staff, within the students, and between students and staff. Staff members who dislike each other often contradict one another either openly or subtly, and students get caught in the crossfire. This idea of a supervisor calling another supervisor’s plan stupid isn’t something that’s uncommon, although I think splurting out expletives isn’t a common sight these days. The patient might have caught a supervisor on a bad day. Most staff tend not to splurt expletives in front of patients, but they might not be so kind to students or even their junior staff in private. Even students sometime compete against one another in an ugly fight. Students are given very little resources to work with, thrown into seemingly impossible situations, and sometimes it turns into a dog eat dog world, where the fittest or most vicious survives.

Fourthly, the system of power and abuse is not only reflected in the way the faculty treats it students, but also its less “important” staff (which we completely disagree with – all members of the healthcare system must be treated equally). Janitors are ill-treated by the dental nurses – dental nurses have even chased janitors out of the pantry and banned them from using the fridge once. Recently, lab technicians have almost all quit the faculty due to how the management has abused them. As a result, students have lost the technician support they need to complete their denture and crown cases. I feel sorry for the students out there who are still studying, it was hard in our time, but it seems impossible in theirs right now. I hope the school manages to hire more labtechs to help all of these struggling kids.

Fifthly, students are placed under incredible stressful forces that no other dental school exerts. Did you know that Singaporean dental students are expected to source for their own patients they need to graduate? The school does send some our way, but the bulk of our patients have to be found ourselves. These include fillings, root canal therapy, gum disease, dentures, crowns and even surgical extractions. Have you ever tried looking for 3 patients who have completely no teeth amongst your friends and family? Zero teeth at all, it’s like trying to strike gold in a mud river. Students overseas do not have such pressure placed on them. They are given patients by the school, which deems it part of their job to supply students with the necessary patients to help them get sufficient training. This is not the case in Singapore. In Singapore, if you have no patients, you simply get retained, each year of unsubsidised school fee is about 100,000 SGD (29,000 subsidised), and each year of lost opportunity cost in terms of starting income comes up to about 60,000 SGD. Just imagine losing 90,000 SGD simply because you couldn’t find enough patients to work on. In the UK and Australia, students never worry about such things, simply because the school believes that it is its job to provide students with the resources they need to bolster their training. Yet, our elite world class institution fails to do so.

Sixthly, the insults and poor student treatment. Overseas, and even in local medical schools, teachers maintain a certain degree of respect for students. They are encouraged to ask, to learn, to enjoy their course of study. In NUS Dentistry, this does not seem to be the case. Here, there are stupid questions, there are stupid students, and there are also stupid students who ask too many stupid questions. Not all teachers are so mean, but a number of them are. They have given dental students nightmares for decades. Even dentists in their later years remember the days of being tortured in school by nasty individuals. If students are constantly afraid of being wrong, punished, marked through negative marking and kicked out of the clinic (when the patients are still on the dental chair), shouted at, reprimanded, called names, and stared at as if they were worthless, no authentic learning can possibly be achieved. Furthermore, members of the staff are known to constantly imply to students that those who step out of line will be punished, the worst threat being retention, since much of dentistry work is subjective.

Think of it this way, if you submit a work of art, some may think it’s great, and some may think it’s ugly, so the assessor has full autonomy to decide if you pass or fail. If you build a denture or a crown that is in accordance to the design that the assessor likes, you get a pass, but if the assessor does not like it, you fail. Inter-assessor difference depends on the varying school of thoughts. This is accepted in the faculty. However, this also gives supervisors and staff the autonomy to fail students based on subjective ideas and feelings. This means that the supervisor rarely needs to justify why the student has failed since much of it is subjective. (Also, students always walk into the final professional BDS exams, not knowing their CA marks, so nobody actually knows how much marks you need to score in your final exams to graduate. How you’re assessed is a complete mystery – with the exception of the ever-so-kind pedodontics and periodontic departments who always have their student's interests in mind)

Because of all this, it is dangerous to speak out. I know batchmates who have been disliked for whatever reason, be it speaking out, or doing things that displeases certain members of the staff and have been directly or indirectly retained for it. It’s an open secret that the faculty will punish whoever dares to challenge their authority. I thought I was lucky to be admitted to the school of dentistry until I saw the blatant abuses of power of those who have accumulated power for themselves over many years – something I never expected to see in Singapore.

Most students will be too afraid to speak up even if the media does approach them, and the school warns students against talking to the media. I hope that this letter from a senior and graduate will let all the struggling students out there know that they are not alone, to work hard, to strive on, and become the healthcare workers Singapore deserve.

Singapore has changed, the PAP has changed, the voices of the minority now matter, please let the voices and cries of the students in the Faculty of Dentistry and bitter graduates be heard.

2,[JC] Crush On PW Groupmate: Advice Needed,"Hi! I transferred this year to a JC somewhere in the West. 

Many people in JC develop crushes during OG, CCA, or having an EC on that cute guy around campus...

Unfortunately, in a wattpad-esque twist of fate, mine started with H1 Project Work.

Changing schools was difficult to acclimatise, and I never expected to start liking anyone, but he was the first few people to reach out to me :) 

And before I knew it, I saw our names together in the same grouping. 

I SWEAR, whenever he walks over to my desk during PW, and leans in, showing me his laptop, I LEGIT DOKI DOKI. And then there’s listening to his insights about our topic, I can’t help but smile at how brilliant he is. We stare at each other, and finally he says:
""About our Case Study 2.1...""
AND THE ROMANTIC TENSION IS GONE. ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. 


(This is such a niche problem, I literally can't find advice online for it :,)) At first, I was pretty happy with the amount of time we get to spend together, but as the common saying goes:
“PW destroys relationships.""

Firstly, the amount of stress we've faced rewriting our drafts made him see PW in a bad light, and by extension, me in a bad light. Project Work became something he dreaded, so even before we could establish a good friendship, he just sees me as an annoying groupmate. (Kind of like anti-Pavlov Effect) 

Even before he could get to know my personality, he has seen my anxious, calculative, and overly-stressed sides, which painted me in a really terrible light in his eyes. I'm just so envious of classmates who could get to know him better as friends, instead of being forced into this project together, and having our relationship defined by it.

Next, you've heard of the woes of the friendzone, now get ready for...

THE PW-GROUPMATE ZONE.

Whenever he talks to me, it's ALWAYS ABOUT PW. He's a very sociable and open guy by nature, so I'm so salty how he texts other girls about his personal life, whereas all the texts I get are the DAMN ROOT CAUSE or GAPS IN CURRENT MEASURES.

I've always thought PW was a conversation starter, but this boy is HOPELESS. Whenever I try to redirect or flesh out the conversation to something else, he somehow ALWAYS brings it back to GODDAMN PW, given his work-oriented personality. I AM IN DEEP AGONY. Legit no hope with him sia

On the bright side, I'm able to access his serious hardworking sides, and watch him smile when we work on our report together :) I'm also able to silently support him, like spending HOURS finding SI for his parts (oh god), which in turn improves the quality of our report!!

Our relationship is getting way better, given how much we laugh during our discussions, and I even offer to help him with our other subjects :) 

I'm just so worried if the end of PW spells the end of our relationship, one that's founded on the premise of being colleagues instead of camaraderie.

I don't just want to be known as 'the girl in my PW group', but I don't know how to be something more than that :,)

3,[Rant] F*ck the system and everything it stands for.,"Context: I attended a neighbourhood primary school before graduating and attending a relatively middle-of-the-pack secondary school (COP 230+). Throughout my relatively limited years of schooling, I've come to discover that the entire system that we're all subjected to is cruel, unfair and makes absolutely no sense. Essentially: It's wrong. I don't even know why I'm so hung up on this but I've just felt the need to get this out of my system. I don't know how long this post might be, but I want to address:

1. Banding, Banding and Banding
2. Inherited meritocracy class differences
3. Funding and opportunities
4. Rote learning and the exam system

**1.) Screw banding**

Singapore has an extremely discriminatory atmosphere when it comes to academic inclination. I can clearly remember in Primary 3 when students were split up into classes based on academic ability; classes ranging from ""3A"" to ""3F"" in decreasing performance. This evidently has life-altering impacts on the students' life. From the age of 9, the education system already labels *children* in accordance with their supposed intelligence. Through this categorisation of ""smartness"", impressionable children who underperform start believing that they aren't up to par with their counterparts in the top classes. They start believing that they are forever fated to get Cs and Ds. Conversely, those in top classes start believing that they are inherently superior -- this is where elitism starts. Schools assign top teachers and more resources to these top classes whereas others just have to settle for the scraps. Schools start inculcating in the students of the top class that they are the ""cream of the crop"". I understand that IQ differences play a role in academic performance and that some are genuinely born ""smarter"" but it cannot be understated that shoving young children into boxes so early on in their academic careers has damaging consequences. I regretfully can say that, being in these so called ""top classes"", I often made snide remarks to my peers when I was in primary school. Interestingly, although there are frameworks that allows students to advance to ""better"" classes, once we were banded in Primary 3, my class virtually remained unchanged up until PSLE. Once again, the incessant messaging that we were the ""smartest, best-est class"" certainly created a pygmalion effect of sorts where the expectation of our teachers translated to higher grades. With the completion of PSLE, those in the top classes ended up attending prestigious schools with the likes of RI, TJC (IP) and AHS whereas those in lower classes went straight to the NA and NT streams. I refuse to believe that these students are stupid. I refuse to accept the idea that I am somehow more intelligent than them -- I am not. I do however believe that they are the byproduct of a cruel and unforgiving banding system that is blind to understanding and compassion. Now that I've experienced secondary school, the same exact the is happening again. I'm told (yet again) that my class is the best, and some subject heads even antagonise students from combined-science classes. Banding is disgusting and has to stop.

&#x200B;

**2.)  Inherited meritocracy and money**

In theory, meritocracy is a wonderful idea: You should obviously get rewarded for your hard work! However, this line of thinking becomes fallacious and harmful when students with affluent parents have access to a wide gamut of enrichment and tuition classes. These students continually outperform their less well-off counterparts simply because they have access to resources that others don't. When I first entered my current secondary school, I was honestly appalled to how many of my classmates lived in landed properties and how many of their parents owned private vehicles. Coming from a neighbourhood school where everyone I knew lived in HDBs, my new environment was jarring and frightening. Students who have ""inherited"" meritocracy from their parents often don't feel comfortable admitting that their parent's riches have gone a long way in helping them to get where they are. There is absolutely no way you can deny how class differences are painfully stark in our education system when the trope of an elite school student is that of a snobby and entitled brat. I wish not to discredit elite school students as I know some who are genuinely amazing human beings but the writing's on the wall: money can buy you a good education.

Edit: Wanted to mention that education IMO plays a big factor into the widening of social inequality. Simply put, good school = good connections = good job = good money = sending your future kid to the same good school.

&#x200B;

**3.) Funding and opportunity**

It is known fact that elite schools churn out successful alumni who donate generously back to their alma mater (that's right, im fucking looking at you, raffles association). Although there is nothing wrong with being generous to your ex-school, we have to be reminded that these elite schools already get funding aplenty from MOE. Whenever I go for competition or other events in said elite schools, I often find myself marvelling at their up-to-date classroom and brand spanking new amenities. Contrast this to my school, which can't even afford to fix a broken fucking window. Not only do elite schools have access to better facilities, they can also afford to send their students for various courses, competitions, and overseas learning journeys. Top schools often invite government officials to engage in dialogue with their students, and top JCs also can afford to give their students counselling on how to get into top ivy league and UK universities. Not to mention, the surplus funding also allows elite schools to explore niche CCAs that other schools cannot. This brings me to Heng Swee Keat's quote that got me so riled up in the first place:

*""Every school is a good school""*

Hearing this sentence makes me instinctively cringe and gag. If all schools are good, why are parents fighting to enrol their DDs and MMs into a select few primary schools? If all schools are good, why do students from top schools get to experience things that other students don't? If all schools are good, why does my auntie fawn over my cousin during reunion dinner when he announced he was attending VJC? This ""Every school a good school"" IS STRAIGHT UP BS, and is frankly outright insulting to the majority of students. This belief only entrenches and worsens the issue at hand.

&#x200B;

Edit: Also SAP schools and religious schools don't make any sense to me. If Singapore is truly multiracial and secular then these schools shouldn't need to exist. Also, most SAP schools are pretty much mono-ethnically Chinese, so much so that they've become colloquially known as ""Chinese schools"". There is a way to keep Chinese tradition alive without needing to institute mono-ethnic schools that end up making it's student populace ignorant and unaware of other cultures/races. Similarly for religious schools, it is never a good idea to intertwine religion with education. Believe in whatever you want, but don't enforce your beliefs onto students.

&#x200B;

**4.) Rote learning and the exam system**

I feel like I don't need to say much here. Being able to memorise lines of text doesn't make you smart. How come Singapore can proudly proclaim to be ""Best in Math/Science"" or ""Best in Reading"" when our local talents end up in middle management in the workplace? How come this so called ""Best education system"" doesn't churn out nobel laureates or new patents? Rote memorisation, and the wider exam system does not and **will never** produce truly bright minds.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if my views are too distasteful to digest but I really needed to say my bit.

Edit: I want to tell everyone who reads this that every single one of you, and i mean *all of you* are worthy and unique in your own ways. Don't let this system define you and please let it define your perception of others, too. :))

5,"[Rant] Bio can save lives, but Bio paper 2 can ruin lives","There was was a child named Joe. Since young, Joe dreamt of becoming the world's greatest doctor, he wished to save many lives, and hoped to help many people along the way. He had done well for his psle and managed to get into a great school atop a hill. He worked hard everyday, going home to help his father in his job selling newspapers. He then would sit quietly in his room to study, for hours on end, every night till he fell asleep. With his dream burned in his mind he tried his best in secondary 3 and scored an A1 for biology and chemistry. He also wished to become a doctor to help sustain his family, for he felt a lingering feeling of pain and guilt when he saw his father working hard. 

However, in the mid of secondary 4, whilst delivering something to his great aunt in malaysia. The government declared that he was not allowed back in, unless he stayed dormant for 14 days, in a hospital isolation ward. He did not know what to do, but grit his teeth and went for it.
He sat for 14 days, later weeks and in the end months, for he was forgotten by the nurses and the doctors. He came to one day, and decided to get the attention of a nurse. He had stayed so long in his own rotting hell. The nurse discovered a shrivelled man, hiding from the world, for he was embarassed that he had to stay 14 days away without helping his father.

The child was encouraged by the nurse, and he managed to leave the hospital. The day he left the hospital was the week before his O levels started.

6,[Rant] Adam Khoo and his courses.,"*TW: Suicide, mental illness, ASD references.*

A few years ago, I went for an Adam Khoo motivational course. The experience was exhilarating, and I found myself at the end of it all inspired to turn over a new leaf and to do extremely well; but as time went on I began to realise how *unhelpful* the lessons were. Not only were the lessons unhelpful, but they were also *damaging* to one's motivation and mental health.

The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn't know anything about mental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses. Khoo himself has pseudoscientific and naive views of mental illness, claiming that ""if you believe that you are clinical (sic) depressed, that mere thought will stimulate chemicals in your brain that will continue to make you feel depressed."" (1) His brand of coaching relies on a pseudoscience called neuro-linguistic programming, (2) a psychotherapeutic methodology that has little evidence to support it. (3)

At the course, my first experience with people with mental illnesses came when I met an old classmate who had Autism. (a) Vaguely, I recall that the one of the student-trainers remarked that there was 'at least one every year.' My second experience came during a group-sharing session, where we had to share with our cohorts our personal issues in a sort of group-therapy. A girl (b) decided to share, and she talked about how she had self-harmed on some occasions. At one point, she was about to attempt suicide before a friend talked her out of it. (c)

Then, the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act. He talked about how she had family that loved her and how killing herself would hurt her family deeply. Second, he talked about self-harm. He shared about his experience with a student who regularly self-harmed, who often 'pretended' to hide their scars, who was obviously 'attention-seeking'. His advice on self-harm was to slice chicken instead of flesh. 

She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, she didn't *learn anything*, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming. Neither was she referred to other resources to help her with her problems. In the end, it all came down to a *joke*. (d)

\~

So far, I've only talked about Khoo's (and his trainers') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo and his trainers do not have any proper training in psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). To give you a sense of what NLP is, practitioners believe that they can tell if people are lying just by looking at their eyes. (They can't.) (4) This willingness to believe in pseudoscience transfers directly over to Khoo's teaching methodology. His advice on studying and motivation is either platitudinous or faulty.

For the most part, the advice is platitudinous. Even Dr Barbara Oakley, a professor in education, asks Khoo to ""go beyond platitudes and just go straight to what goes on in real everyday life"" in an interview. (5) If you want to know what a lesson by Khoo is like, a video on YouTube entitled 'Adam Khoo - How to Condense Information - learn how to read fast and effectively' is a good example. In thirteen minutes, Khoo ironically states what could be said in two-or-three minutes: longform text is not very good for revision as it contains a lot of descriptive language; making summary notes with diagrams is better. 

Some advice stands on shaky ground. Khoo believes in speed-reading, which has little empirical evidence to support its purported benefits. (7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), which is again pseudoscientific and which has been criticised by Dr Oakley. (8) (9) .

Every piece of advice he gives, however dubious, is in his *I Am Gifted* book too, so there really is no need to spend thousands of dollars on the course.

\~

**TLDR: Don't go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren't helpful; they are bad.** If you want study tips, Drs Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski have two online courses on them: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) and [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift). If you want help with motivation or mood, Dr David Burns has a book on cognitive behavioural therapy, [Feeling Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good:_The_New_Mood_Therapy). And, if you want help with mental illness, you might want to consider psychiatry and/or psychotherapy.

\~

(a) I had known the classmate since primary school, and it was known that he had Autism at the time. Back then, the term Autism Spectrum Disorder was not in use, and I believe that Autism would have been the official diagnosis. I also note that some consider Autism to be a neurodevelopment disorder rather than a mental illness.

(b) I portrayed the actual person as a girl so I could refer to them with a feminine pronoun and to the trainer with a masculine pronoun. The gender used is not indicative of identity.

(c) Although I only met two people who had so-called mental illnesses or mental disorders, I suspect that many more students are sent to such courses. I realise now that some parents sent their children to Adam Khoo because they are afraid of acknowledging that their children might need help. That's why we have 'enrichment' centres—your child is being *enriche*d instead of being *helped*.

And in the anti-psychiatric society we live in, parents would rather spend thousands of dollars on pseudoscience than let their children seek psychiatry or psychotherapy. They're scared of thinking that there might be something wrong with them or their child. Khoo would never *label* your child with a mental illness. In his eyes, we are *gifted*, after all.

(d) Tony Robbins, incidentally, has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_YqsqJBUfw) where he 'saves' a suicidal man. Robbins doesn't actually save the man, nor does he help him in any real, tangible way. All he did was tell a joke and make a the man smile. Some may be inclined to believe that making a suicidal person smile, 'breaking their depressed state' can help them out of suicide, but it really doesn't. It doesn't teach them how to better cope with their problems in living, nor does it address their mental health, nor does it address any potentially organic causes of such a mood. Robbins is, incidentally, an NLP practitioner.

**Addendum: Adam Khoo and Health**

I've talked a lot about Khoo's pseudoscientific beliefs in mental health, which leads me to question his beliefs in other aspects of health. For instance, he believes that [cancer can be cured through ""the power of the mind.""](https://www.adam-khoo.com/91/congratulations-to-my-mum-for-getting-her-book-published/) Why then, was Khoo a [director of the Health Promotion Board from 2009-2011](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkhoo/)? And why did the Ministry of Education grant a [tender on sexual health education to his company in 2015 and 2017](https://opengovsg.com/corporate/200721495D)? One can only hope Khoo and his company are more scientific when it comes to other aspects of health.

7,[O LEVELS] Retaining bc of an illness,"Hi !
sorry to disturb yall in the midst of preparing for the national exams. I was supposed to sit for the GCE O levels this year, but alas my health deteriorated insidiously and gave me innumerable problems. In fact, this is my 11th month being plagued by this illness. So i was medically exempted from all the 2020 o level papers by a professional , and Im on bed rest at home now. Im due to return to my school to repeat the year in 2021. I am currently in recovery.

I would like to find out from ppl who had to retain, how was yr exp? My close friends keep reassuring me that bc of my amicable character and personality traits, it will be easy for me to make friends , and that people would not bully me or judge me since juniors tend to look up to their seniors. 2020 was really fucking shitty for me already and i was devastated upon the prospect of having to retain , and it rlly took an emotional toll on me, but oh well, my health does come first so. 

Asking all those who were held back, how was the experience? Did yall get bullied, did you make good friends? I have to repeat Napfa and everything and Im js really nervous bc I do wanna excel academically but i also need a freaking friend group for emotional support and academic help and all. The teachers in my sch felt bad for me bc of my health but they were also sweet n understanding. 

Im sorry that my rant is so superfluous and lengthy but Im stuck  btwn a rock and a hard place. I am so worried ab next year and stuff, I will feel like an intruder, an outsider, that i don't belong. But the truth is, I just need another shot at this and make the most out  of 2021, since 2020 was a no show for me. Moreover, this not a terminal illness and it is fully possible to recover from it.

I am really sorry for the overly long post. I would greatly appreciate if you guys shared your experiences with me.

8,[A Levels] Your voice,"Hello Redditors. I would like to address everyone from all levels, and it's about choosing your future and chasing your interests. I chose the A Levels flair as I understand many students may face similar problems created by our lovely traditional Asian parents, especially at a crucial turning point in our lives. The following is my story, and at the end, you get to choose your own story.

I am an 18 year old, currently doing National Service. I just completed A Levels in 2019. I come from a Neighborhood Primary School and a prestigious secondary school, moving on to a neighborhood JC. 

Since Primary school, I was forced to study. At 8 years old. Study at P2. Parents put immense pressure for the results sometimes, and that's just my case. This is the juncture where my parents told me, ""You should aim to become a doctor. You get a very high salary, and you can live a peaceful life"". I was misguided,aiming for a doctor job. I didn't even know there was such a thing called specialist until someone in Secondary School asked me. All I knew was that I was chasing for 'doctor'. As for CCA, my parents forced me into Chess club, where I won awards seldom. I was never interested in Chess. 

In secondary school, Sec 1 and 2, I was one of the brightest kids, topping the cohort and going on stage to receive awards. I didn't really have interests at this point. My parents in this case pushed me into a UG group because the uniform looked good on me, not because of interest. I wanted to join a sport like Floorball, but my parents discouraged me, saying sports is very tiring and I cannot study. Sec 1 was the first time I ever got my handphone. You can tell, my parents have a very traditional mindset. Sec 3 came, and this was where my downfall began. I was forced to take triple science, double humans, double math, English, MT and HMT. That's 10 subjects. The reason my parents chose that combination is because it looks good on my portfolio and shows I am very hard-working. What? Who the f() would choose subjects based on what character it defines? You pick subjects based on your interests. And so, I struggled and struggled. Even teachers were advising me to drop subjects because I couldn't cope. I told my parents I couldn't cope, they told me to persevere. I got an astounding 41 points for prelims, but somehow managed to scrape through O levels with a decent score of 10 points. 

Now came JC life. I already hated O Levels study regime. I wanted to go Poly. Again, having traditional parents, they told me Poly is a waste of time, and a diploma is useless. My 12 options for JAE application were all JC, not a single trace of poly course. Even then, I couldn't choose what JC I wanted to go. My parents forced me to choose the JC nearest to my house, which happened to be AJC. The fact that I have been raised as a single child and sheltered one did not give me the ability to choose. My freedom was taken away, I felt like a caged bird. I cried entering JC, I didn't already like the first 2 weeks. The workload kept piling, and I kept struggling. I was forced to join a slack CCA like Drama, and couldn't choose a sports CCA or even something like council. Do note, at this point, my academics may be a something, but personality and skills wise, I was a complete zero. I didn't master a single skill, even simple ones like public speaking or playing a musical instrument. End of J1 came. I did badly, but was given an Advance notice. I had the ability to choose to retain and strengthen my foundations or advance to JC2. Oh btw, I was taking PCMe, the standard combination across the entire Singapore for those who don't know what to do. I didn't honestly know what I wanted to do in the future. I told my parents, I wanted to explore the poly route and do something like engineering. They said ""No you must become doctor. Doctor is the best"". So poly was a taboo. Then I said, ""Can I at least retain and strengthen the foundations?"" and they said ""I have an image to keep in front of my colleagues. What if you see your juniors from last time. Won't you feel shameful? Won't I feel shameful? Retaining is a shame. You can get out of the house if you choose to retain or go poly"". I had no choice, but advanced to JC2. I joined Yoth Corps Singapore Leaders Programme as a hobby to take my mind off studies. My parents told me to quit immediately after just 2 months. My mental resilience I obtained from Youth Corps was gone. I struggled. Prelims was horrible with 5 rankpoints. A Levels? Don't even ask. I got 50 rankpoints. A miserable E for PCMe, GP, but an A for PW. Even my results tell you I am more suited for poly, project work is fun and manageable for me. I am more of an independent and practical learner, and theory, mugging, regurgitation, vomiting TYS and past year papers never worked for me. Even after my results and months of childing, my parents never understood the point. They told me to retake A Levels in NS. 

I turned 18. I was studying in NS with no drive. Even when I didn't want to study or was lazy, I was blessed to have section mates who would wake me up way early and remind me to study. I didn't tell them I didn't have interest in retaking A's. I just told them I was retaking. Then this CB came. CB is actually a blessing in disguise for me.

Everyone around me told me to study. I didn't. Instead, I used this precious time to reflect on my mistakes, my fitness, my skills, my future. A lot of thinking was done. I wrote a journal entry every single day to see how I was feeling. 

Finally, I came up with a gameplan. How to develop my skills, and joining Poly after my ORD. I am soon telling about this plan to my parents. It's 3am in the morning, and I'm wondering about their reaction to my news. This time, I will argue with them to follow my interests, or even have to fight for my future. These are my rights, I deserve a choice, and I get to choose my future. This is my voice. I have just started a personal blog. You can PM me for the link!
Keep in mind, I just started a few days ago to develop my skills as a freelance blogger!This blog will entertain suggestion on new issues, and I hope to get my point across to everyone;

Always follow your interest, and have a plan for your future. You get to make, or break your own story. You choose, because this is YOUR VOICE.

EDIT: It worked!! My mother was more accepting to what I wanted to do, and I can join poly soon :) Thank you everyone for personally writing into the comments section, it means a lot that you have read through the post.

EDIT 2: Since many of y'all are asking, I'll just plug the link to my blog here; amperiple.wordpress.com

EDIT 3: Things took a huge turn after I confessed to my dad I had no interest in retaking A's. A large argument broke out, but I am getting a chance to pursue a degree in Biomed in another country. My life is on course, but my parents have become more understanding, and are the backbone of this opportunity.

9,[O levels] Best chinese situational writing,"This was sent in my mt class chat:

So I decided to dick around for the email. Hopefully this helps everyone pull the bell curve down.

你好！太久没收到你的电邮了，我还以为你不爱我了。今天我看到你的电邮，眼睛（i wrote this in pinyin LOL）亮起来。但是我读你的电邮后，才发现原来你只要我的帮助。你那里可以这样对我？我也有心情的。。。

算了。我来帮你这个烂人吧。我带我的海外学生去走新加坡的路，走来走去我发现你很像新加坡，一样美丽！！

你也可以带他去吃我们新加坡的食物，像鸡饭。这会让他留下来很美好的回忆，跟一个美女吃饭！其实我也要吃你的鸡饭哈哈哈

你应该特别注意他是什么样的人。我希望他不是帅哥，把你从我身边抢走。修华，别走。。。。

希望你后不回后悔没选择我，最不起我不能让你够开心。你坚持着说要走，说他比我要帅（i forgot how to write 温柔），我终于安静放了手。。。

他妈的你这样的女人拍拍屁股走了，别再打扰我了
