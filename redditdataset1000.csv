0,[Rant] Transgender Discrimination in Singapore Schools and MOE's denial of mental health issues,"Note: I am posting this on a throwaway as I am an active redditor to avoid disclosing my main account containing information that I'd like to not reveal. However, some of you may know who I am.

Having been essentially barred from returning to lessons in my government MOE school, I have become a target of the MOE. To give a bit of background, I am transgender male-to-female, using she/her pronouns. I used to attend an all-boys' primary school and it was the worst period of my life - I couldn't fit in and constantly got bullied because I was 'too soft' and 'needed to man up to the bullies'. Despite being there, I always wanted to dress like girls, have a typical female hairstyle etc. Things took a turn ever since I entered a co-ed secondary school; I started making more friends and understanding my identity. I was then taken to the gender clinic at the IMH. However, since getting a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria from the IMH, my schooling life in the MOE system has gone from great to utter trash, pretty much forcing me to transfer from my current school to a polytechnic course which is not really ideal and not exactly in line with what ambitions I had in mind.
(Gender dysphoria is listed as a disorder under Gender identity disorders in the ICD-10 by the WHO)

Here's a timeline: ever since getting the diagnosis, I informed the MOE of it through my JC, and the reply from the MOE according to my school's administration was simply that 'This is a new issue and we would like to work with you to learn more about it.'
All was well for several months, though rules were vague given that I had a proper diagnosis from a qualified doctor. My classmates and subject tutors are highly supportive.
Then, as I was about to undergo hormone therapy (a treatment explicitly stated in the ICD-10, again, and recommended by the multiple doctors attending to trans patients in Singapore) the request was suddenly blocked as the MOE had intervened, apparently for the reason 'students in MOE schools are under our control, and we have every right and say over their treatment'. This meant that my doctor had to call off the referral, causing me further mental trauma as this affected my ability to pass and present as a female. Alongside this, I was informed that I had to cut my hair to fit the boys' hairstyle in the handbook, and that I was specifically to wear the male uniform; that could probably have slipped under the radar but it seems unlikely as all these troubles started in the same month. In addition, if I became unable to fit in the boys' uniform if I somehow got hormone therapy, I would be expelled from school, instead of being allowed to wear the female uniform. The principal's explanation for this was that 'due to your presentation, you would be as disruptive to the school environment as a student with severe autism'.

What right does the MOE have over the MOH? Why is the MOE interfering with my medical care, and the irony of [MOE advocating for mental health issues](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/mental-health). I cannot speak for others, but in my experience, these are outright lies and just a farce to gain support from the younger generations of students.

Update: MOE has posted a complete [denial](https://i.imgur.com/8WcQGMB.png) of this issue on Facebook. That is an outright lie, contradicts what I was told by my doctor, and I am sure my classmates can vouch for me. In addition, they do not respect my pronouns and instead intentionally misgendered me (against the advice and recommendations)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwqqdu/rant_transgender_discrimination_in_singapore/,True,2021-01-14 13:44:37
1,[Uni] Why I Disliked Being in NUS Dentistry (Advice for Future Applicants)," 

Firstly, it might sound incredulous to many of you, but the NUS Dentistry is an incredibly oppressive place to be in. Students are expected to fall in line. Those who attract attention get themselves in trouble. I’ve often heard from my friends in medicine about how they are able to feedback to the school about the problems they face. I find it incredibly hard to see the day where the Faculty of Dentistry entertains student feedback. Every year, the school asks its students for feedback, and almost every year, student feedback participation is incredibly low. The school blames the students for being lazy and unresponsive, but has the school ever asked itself why this is so? Perhaps it is because students have realised that their feedback doesn’t even matter. Why would we feedback, when none of it is taken into consideration? Why should we respond to a survey that is dismissed by lecturers and supervisors who repeat the same cycle of top-down instruction every year?

Secondly, students and even junior staff are often called upon to respect the hierarchy. Even if you’re right, you’re wrong as long as your opinion clashes with someone who is more senior than you. I was taught to keep my head down in school, and so I did. Every time I was shouted at, scolded, spoken to like I’m a worthless bottom-feeder, I took the beating and laid low. To be fair, that kept me out of the radar just enough for me to slip out under. Afterall, none of us escape this place without getting scuffed up a little. It was a small price to pay to get out. I never really got the brunt of the beating, but some of my classmates were less fortunate. Those who challenged those in charge were punished, and they had their lives made difficult and some were retained as a result.

Thirdly, the school is a political minefield. Tensions exist within the staff, within the students, and between students and staff. Staff members who dislike each other often contradict one another either openly or subtly, and students get caught in the crossfire. This idea of a supervisor calling another supervisor’s plan stupid isn’t something that’s uncommon, although I think splurting out expletives isn’t a common sight these days. The patient might have caught a supervisor on a bad day. Most staff tend not to splurt expletives in front of patients, but they might not be so kind to students or even their junior staff in private. Even students sometime compete against one another in an ugly fight. Students are given very little resources to work with, thrown into seemingly impossible situations, and sometimes it turns into a dog eat dog world, where the fittest or most vicious survives.

Fourthly, the system of power and abuse is not only reflected in the way the faculty treats it students, but also its less “important” staff (which we completely disagree with – all members of the healthcare system must be treated equally). Janitors are ill-treated by the dental nurses – dental nurses have even chased janitors out of the pantry and banned them from using the fridge once. Recently, lab technicians have almost all quit the faculty due to how the management has abused them. As a result, students have lost the technician support they need to complete their denture and crown cases. I feel sorry for the students out there who are still studying, it was hard in our time, but it seems impossible in theirs right now. I hope the school manages to hire more labtechs to help all of these struggling kids.

Fifthly, students are placed under incredible stressful forces that no other dental school exerts. Did you know that Singaporean dental students are expected to source for their own patients they need to graduate? The school does send some our way, but the bulk of our patients have to be found ourselves. These include fillings, root canal therapy, gum disease, dentures, crowns and even surgical extractions. Have you ever tried looking for 3 patients who have completely no teeth amongst your friends and family? Zero teeth at all, it’s like trying to strike gold in a mud river. Students overseas do not have such pressure placed on them. They are given patients by the school, which deems it part of their job to supply students with the necessary patients to help them get sufficient training. This is not the case in Singapore. In Singapore, if you have no patients, you simply get retained, each year of unsubsidised school fee is about 100,000 SGD (29,000 subsidised), and each year of lost opportunity cost in terms of starting income comes up to about 60,000 SGD. Just imagine losing 90,000 SGD simply because you couldn’t find enough patients to work on. In the UK and Australia, students never worry about such things, simply because the school believes that it is its job to provide students with the resources they need to bolster their training. Yet, our elite world class institution fails to do so.

Sixthly, the insults and poor student treatment. Overseas, and even in local medical schools, teachers maintain a certain degree of respect for students. They are encouraged to ask, to learn, to enjoy their course of study. In NUS Dentistry, this does not seem to be the case. Here, there are stupid questions, there are stupid students, and there are also stupid students who ask too many stupid questions. Not all teachers are so mean, but a number of them are. They have given dental students nightmares for decades. Even dentists in their later years remember the days of being tortured in school by nasty individuals. If students are constantly afraid of being wrong, punished, marked through negative marking and kicked out of the clinic (when the patients are still on the dental chair), shouted at, reprimanded, called names, and stared at as if they were worthless, no authentic learning can possibly be achieved. Furthermore, members of the staff are known to constantly imply to students that those who step out of line will be punished, the worst threat being retention, since much of dentistry work is subjective.

Think of it this way, if you submit a work of art, some may think it’s great, and some may think it’s ugly, so the assessor has full autonomy to decide if you pass or fail. If you build a denture or a crown that is in accordance to the design that the assessor likes, you get a pass, but if the assessor does not like it, you fail. Inter-assessor difference depends on the varying school of thoughts. This is accepted in the faculty. However, this also gives supervisors and staff the autonomy to fail students based on subjective ideas and feelings. This means that the supervisor rarely needs to justify why the student has failed since much of it is subjective. (Also, students always walk into the final professional BDS exams, not knowing their CA marks, so nobody actually knows how much marks you need to score in your final exams to graduate. How you’re assessed is a complete mystery – with the exception of the ever-so-kind pedodontics and periodontic departments who always have their student's interests in mind)

Because of all this, it is dangerous to speak out. I know batchmates who have been disliked for whatever reason, be it speaking out, or doing things that displeases certain members of the staff and have been directly or indirectly retained for it. It’s an open secret that the faculty will punish whoever dares to challenge their authority. I thought I was lucky to be admitted to the school of dentistry until I saw the blatant abuses of power of those who have accumulated power for themselves over many years – something I never expected to see in Singapore.

Most students will be too afraid to speak up even if the media does approach them, and the school warns students against talking to the media. I hope that this letter from a senior and graduate will let all the struggling students out there know that they are not alone, to work hard, to strive on, and become the healthcare workers Singapore deserve.

Singapore has changed, the PAP has changed, the voices of the minority now matter, please let the voices and cries of the students in the Faculty of Dentistry and bitter graduates be heard.

2,[JC] Crush On PW Groupmate: Advice Needed,"Hi! I transferred this year to a JC somewhere in the West. 

Many people in JC develop crushes during OG, CCA, or having an EC on that cute guy around campus...

Unfortunately, in a wattpad-esque twist of fate, mine started with H1 Project Work.

Changing schools was difficult to acclimatise, and I never expected to start liking anyone, but he was the first few people to reach out to me :) 

And before I knew it, I saw our names together in the same grouping. 

I SWEAR, whenever he walks over to my desk during PW, and leans in, showing me his laptop, I LEGIT DOKI DOKI. And then there’s listening to his insights about our topic, I can’t help but smile at how brilliant he is. We stare at each other, and finally he says:
""About our Case Study 2.1...""
AND THE ROMANTIC TENSION IS GONE. ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH. 


(This is such a niche problem, I literally can't find advice online for it :,)) At first, I was pretty happy with the amount of time we get to spend together, but as the common saying goes:
“PW destroys relationships.""

Firstly, the amount of stress we've faced rewriting our drafts made him see PW in a bad light, and by extension, me in a bad light. Project Work became something he dreaded, so even before we could establish a good friendship, he just sees me as an annoying groupmate. (Kind of like anti-Pavlov Effect) 

Even before he could get to know my personality, he has seen my anxious, calculative, and overly-stressed sides, which painted me in a really terrible light in his eyes. I'm just so envious of classmates who could get to know him better as friends, instead of being forced into this project together, and having our relationship defined by it.

Next, you've heard of the woes of the friendzone, now get ready for...

THE PW-GROUPMATE ZONE.

Whenever he talks to me, it's ALWAYS ABOUT PW. He's a very sociable and open guy by nature, so I'm so salty how he texts other girls about his personal life, whereas all the texts I get are the DAMN ROOT CAUSE or GAPS IN CURRENT MEASURES.

I've always thought PW was a conversation starter, but this boy is HOPELESS. Whenever I try to redirect or flesh out the conversation to something else, he somehow ALWAYS brings it back to GODDAMN PW, given his work-oriented personality. I AM IN DEEP AGONY. Legit no hope with him sia

On the bright side, I'm able to access his serious hardworking sides, and watch him smile when we work on our report together :) I'm also able to silently support him, like spending HOURS finding SI for his parts (oh god), which in turn improves the quality of our report!!

Our relationship is getting way better, given how much we laugh during our discussions, and I even offer to help him with our other subjects :) 

I'm just so worried if the end of PW spells the end of our relationship, one that's founded on the premise of being colleagues instead of camaraderie.

I don't just want to be known as 'the girl in my PW group', but I don't know how to be something more than that :,)

3,[Rant] F*ck the system and everything it stands for.,"Context: I attended a neighbourhood primary school before graduating and attending a relatively middle-of-the-pack secondary school (COP 230+). Throughout my relatively limited years of schooling, I've come to discover that the entire system that we're all subjected to is cruel, unfair and makes absolutely no sense. Essentially: It's wrong. I don't even know why I'm so hung up on this but I've just felt the need to get this out of my system. I don't know how long this post might be, but I want to address:

1. Banding, Banding and Banding
2. Inherited meritocracy class differences
3. Funding and opportunities
4. Rote learning and the exam system

**1.) Screw banding**

Singapore has an extremely discriminatory atmosphere when it comes to academic inclination. I can clearly remember in Primary 3 when students were split up into classes based on academic ability; classes ranging from ""3A"" to ""3F"" in decreasing performance. This evidently has life-altering impacts on the students' life. From the age of 9, the education system already labels *children* in accordance with their supposed intelligence. Through this categorisation of ""smartness"", impressionable children who underperform start believing that they aren't up to par with their counterparts in the top classes. They start believing that they are forever fated to get Cs and Ds. Conversely, those in top classes start believing that they are inherently superior -- this is where elitism starts. Schools assign top teachers and more resources to these top classes whereas others just have to settle for the scraps. Schools start inculcating in the students of the top class that they are the ""cream of the crop"". I understand that IQ differences play a role in academic performance and that some are genuinely born ""smarter"" but it cannot be understated that shoving young children into boxes so early on in their academic careers has damaging consequences. I regretfully can say that, being in these so called ""top classes"", I often made snide remarks to my peers when I was in primary school. Interestingly, although there are frameworks that allows students to advance to ""better"" classes, once we were banded in Primary 3, my class virtually remained unchanged up until PSLE. Once again, the incessant messaging that we were the ""smartest, best-est class"" certainly created a pygmalion effect of sorts where the expectation of our teachers translated to higher grades. With the completion of PSLE, those in the top classes ended up attending prestigious schools with the likes of RI, TJC (IP) and AHS whereas those in lower classes went straight to the NA and NT streams. I refuse to believe that these students are stupid. I refuse to accept the idea that I am somehow more intelligent than them -- I am not. I do however believe that they are the byproduct of a cruel and unforgiving banding system that is blind to understanding and compassion. Now that I've experienced secondary school, the same exact the is happening again. I'm told (yet again) that my class is the best, and some subject heads even antagonise students from combined-science classes. Banding is disgusting and has to stop.

&#x200B;

**2.)  Inherited meritocracy and money**

In theory, meritocracy is a wonderful idea: You should obviously get rewarded for your hard work! However, this line of thinking becomes fallacious and harmful when students with affluent parents have access to a wide gamut of enrichment and tuition classes. These students continually outperform their less well-off counterparts simply because they have access to resources that others don't. When I first entered my current secondary school, I was honestly appalled to how many of my classmates lived in landed properties and how many of their parents owned private vehicles. Coming from a neighbourhood school where everyone I knew lived in HDBs, my new environment was jarring and frightening. Students who have ""inherited"" meritocracy from their parents often don't feel comfortable admitting that their parent's riches have gone a long way in helping them to get where they are. There is absolutely no way you can deny how class differences are painfully stark in our education system when the trope of an elite school student is that of a snobby and entitled brat. I wish not to discredit elite school students as I know some who are genuinely amazing human beings but the writing's on the wall: money can buy you a good education.

Edit: Wanted to mention that education IMO plays a big factor into the widening of social inequality. Simply put, good school = good connections = good job = good money = sending your future kid to the same good school.

&#x200B;

**3.) Funding and opportunity**

It is known fact that elite schools churn out successful alumni who donate generously back to their alma mater (that's right, im fucking looking at you, raffles association). Although there is nothing wrong with being generous to your ex-school, we have to be reminded that these elite schools already get funding aplenty from MOE. Whenever I go for competition or other events in said elite schools, I often find myself marvelling at their up-to-date classroom and brand spanking new amenities. Contrast this to my school, which can't even afford to fix a broken fucking window. Not only do elite schools have access to better facilities, they can also afford to send their students for various courses, competitions, and overseas learning journeys. Top schools often invite government officials to engage in dialogue with their students, and top JCs also can afford to give their students counselling on how to get into top ivy league and UK universities. Not to mention, the surplus funding also allows elite schools to explore niche CCAs that other schools cannot. This brings me to Heng Swee Keat's quote that got me so riled up in the first place:

*""Every school is a good school""*

Hearing this sentence makes me instinctively cringe and gag. If all schools are good, why are parents fighting to enrol their DDs and MMs into a select few primary schools? If all schools are good, why do students from top schools get to experience things that other students don't? If all schools are good, why does my auntie fawn over my cousin during reunion dinner when he announced he was attending VJC? This ""Every school a good school"" IS STRAIGHT UP BS, and is frankly outright insulting to the majority of students. This belief only entrenches and worsens the issue at hand.

&#x200B;

Edit: Also SAP schools and religious schools don't make any sense to me. If Singapore is truly multiracial and secular then these schools shouldn't need to exist. Also, most SAP schools are pretty much mono-ethnically Chinese, so much so that they've become colloquially known as ""Chinese schools"". There is a way to keep Chinese tradition alive without needing to institute mono-ethnic schools that end up making it's student populace ignorant and unaware of other cultures/races. Similarly for religious schools, it is never a good idea to intertwine religion with education. Believe in whatever you want, but don't enforce your beliefs onto students.

&#x200B;

**4.) Rote learning and the exam system**

I feel like I don't need to say much here. Being able to memorise lines of text doesn't make you smart. How come Singapore can proudly proclaim to be ""Best in Math/Science"" or ""Best in Reading"" when our local talents end up in middle management in the workplace? How come this so called ""Best education system"" doesn't churn out nobel laureates or new patents? Rote memorisation, and the wider exam system does not and **will never** produce truly bright minds.

&#x200B;

I'm sorry if my views are too distasteful to digest but I really needed to say my bit.

Edit: I want to tell everyone who reads this that every single one of you, and i mean *all of you* are worthy and unique in your own ways. Don't let this system define you and please let it define your perception of others, too. :))

5,"[Rant] Bio can save lives, but Bio paper 2 can ruin lives","There was was a child named Joe. Since young, Joe dreamt of becoming the world's greatest doctor, he wished to save many lives, and hoped to help many people along the way. He had done well for his psle and managed to get into a great school atop a hill. He worked hard everyday, going home to help his father in his job selling newspapers. He then would sit quietly in his room to study, for hours on end, every night till he fell asleep. With his dream burned in his mind he tried his best in secondary 3 and scored an A1 for biology and chemistry. He also wished to become a doctor to help sustain his family, for he felt a lingering feeling of pain and guilt when he saw his father working hard. 

However, in the mid of secondary 4, whilst delivering something to his great aunt in malaysia. The government declared that he was not allowed back in, unless he stayed dormant for 14 days, in a hospital isolation ward. He did not know what to do, but grit his teeth and went for it.
He sat for 14 days, later weeks and in the end months, for he was forgotten by the nurses and the doctors. He came to one day, and decided to get the attention of a nurse. He had stayed so long in his own rotting hell. The nurse discovered a shrivelled man, hiding from the world, for he was embarassed that he had to stay 14 days away without helping his father.

The child was encouraged by the nurse, and he managed to leave the hospital. The day he left the hospital was the week before his O levels started.

6,[Rant] Adam Khoo and his courses.,"*TW: Suicide, mental illness, ASD references.*

A few years ago, I went for an Adam Khoo motivational course. The experience was exhilarating, and I found myself at the end of it all inspired to turn over a new leaf and to do extremely well; but as time went on I began to realise how *unhelpful* the lessons were. Not only were the lessons unhelpful, but they were also *damaging* to one's motivation and mental health.

The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn't know anything about mental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses. Khoo himself has pseudoscientific and naive views of mental illness, claiming that ""if you believe that you are clinical (sic) depressed, that mere thought will stimulate chemicals in your brain that will continue to make you feel depressed."" (1) His brand of coaching relies on a pseudoscience called neuro-linguistic programming, (2) a psychotherapeutic methodology that has little evidence to support it. (3)

At the course, my first experience with people with mental illnesses came when I met an old classmate who had Autism. (a) Vaguely, I recall that the one of the student-trainers remarked that there was 'at least one every year.' My second experience came during a group-sharing session, where we had to share with our cohorts our personal issues in a sort of group-therapy. A girl (b) decided to share, and she talked about how she had self-harmed on some occasions. At one point, she was about to attempt suicide before a friend talked her out of it. (c)

Then, the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act. He talked about how she had family that loved her and how killing herself would hurt her family deeply. Second, he talked about self-harm. He shared about his experience with a student who regularly self-harmed, who often 'pretended' to hide their scars, who was obviously 'attention-seeking'. His advice on self-harm was to slice chicken instead of flesh. 

She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, she didn't *learn anything*, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming. Neither was she referred to other resources to help her with her problems. In the end, it all came down to a *joke*. (d)

\~

So far, I've only talked about Khoo's (and his trainers') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo and his trainers do not have any proper training in psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). To give you a sense of what NLP is, practitioners believe that they can tell if people are lying just by looking at their eyes. (They can't.) (4) This willingness to believe in pseudoscience transfers directly over to Khoo's teaching methodology. His advice on studying and motivation is either platitudinous or faulty.

For the most part, the advice is platitudinous. Even Dr Barbara Oakley, a professor in education, asks Khoo to ""go beyond platitudes and just go straight to what goes on in real everyday life"" in an interview. (5) If you want to know what a lesson by Khoo is like, a video on YouTube entitled 'Adam Khoo - How to Condense Information - learn how to read fast and effectively' is a good example. In thirteen minutes, Khoo ironically states what could be said in two-or-three minutes: longform text is not very good for revision as it contains a lot of descriptive language; making summary notes with diagrams is better. 

Some advice stands on shaky ground. Khoo believes in speed-reading, which has little empirical evidence to support its purported benefits. (7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), which is again pseudoscientific and which has been criticised by Dr Oakley. (8) (9) .

Every piece of advice he gives, however dubious, is in his *I Am Gifted* book too, so there really is no need to spend thousands of dollars on the course.

\~

**TLDR: Don't go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren't helpful; they are bad.** If you want study tips, Drs Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski have two online courses on them: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) and [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift). If you want help with motivation or mood, Dr David Burns has a book on cognitive behavioural therapy, [Feeling Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good:_The_New_Mood_Therapy). And, if you want help with mental illness, you might want to consider psychiatry and/or psychotherapy.

\~

(a) I had known the classmate since primary school, and it was known that he had Autism at the time. Back then, the term Autism Spectrum Disorder was not in use, and I believe that Autism would have been the official diagnosis. I also note that some consider Autism to be a neurodevelopment disorder rather than a mental illness.

(b) I portrayed the actual person as a girl so I could refer to them with a feminine pronoun and to the trainer with a masculine pronoun. The gender used is not indicative of identity.

(c) Although I only met two people who had so-called mental illnesses or mental disorders, I suspect that many more students are sent to such courses. I realise now that some parents sent their children to Adam Khoo because they are afraid of acknowledging that their children might need help. That's why we have 'enrichment' centres—your child is being *enriche*d instead of being *helped*.

And in the anti-psychiatric society we live in, parents would rather spend thousands of dollars on pseudoscience than let their children seek psychiatry or psychotherapy. They're scared of thinking that there might be something wrong with them or their child. Khoo would never *label* your child with a mental illness. In his eyes, we are *gifted*, after all.

(d) Tony Robbins, incidentally, has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_YqsqJBUfw) where he 'saves' a suicidal man. Robbins doesn't actually save the man, nor does he help him in any real, tangible way. All he did was tell a joke and make a the man smile. Some may be inclined to believe that making a suicidal person smile, 'breaking their depressed state' can help them out of suicide, but it really doesn't. It doesn't teach them how to better cope with their problems in living, nor does it address their mental health, nor does it address any potentially organic causes of such a mood. Robbins is, incidentally, an NLP practitioner.

**Addendum: Adam Khoo and Health**

I've talked a lot about Khoo's pseudoscientific beliefs in mental health, which leads me to question his beliefs in other aspects of health. For instance, he believes that [cancer can be cured through ""the power of the mind.""](https://www.adam-khoo.com/91/congratulations-to-my-mum-for-getting-her-book-published/) Why then, was Khoo a [director of the Health Promotion Board from 2009-2011](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkhoo/)? And why did the Ministry of Education grant a [tender on sexual health education to his company in 2015 and 2017](https://opengovsg.com/corporate/200721495D)? One can only hope Khoo and his company are more scientific when it comes to other aspects of health.

7,[O LEVELS] Retaining bc of an illness,"Hi !
sorry to disturb yall in the midst of preparing for the national exams. I was supposed to sit for the GCE O levels this year, but alas my health deteriorated insidiously and gave me innumerable problems. In fact, this is my 11th month being plagued by this illness. So i was medically exempted from all the 2020 o level papers by a professional , and Im on bed rest at home now. Im due to return to my school to repeat the year in 2021. I am currently in recovery.

I would like to find out from ppl who had to retain, how was yr exp? My close friends keep reassuring me that bc of my amicable character and personality traits, it will be easy for me to make friends , and that people would not bully me or judge me since juniors tend to look up to their seniors. 2020 was really fucking shitty for me already and i was devastated upon the prospect of having to retain , and it rlly took an emotional toll on me, but oh well, my health does come first so. 

Asking all those who were held back, how was the experience? Did yall get bullied, did you make good friends? I have to repeat Napfa and everything and Im js really nervous bc I do wanna excel academically but i also need a freaking friend group for emotional support and academic help and all. The teachers in my sch felt bad for me bc of my health but they were also sweet n understanding. 

Im sorry that my rant is so superfluous and lengthy but Im stuck  btwn a rock and a hard place. I am so worried ab next year and stuff, I will feel like an intruder, an outsider, that i don't belong. But the truth is, I just need another shot at this and make the most out  of 2021, since 2020 was a no show for me. Moreover, this not a terminal illness and it is fully possible to recover from it.

I am really sorry for the overly long post. I would greatly appreciate if you guys shared your experiences with me.

8,[A Levels] Your voice,"Hello Redditors. I would like to address everyone from all levels, and it's about choosing your future and chasing your interests. I chose the A Levels flair as I understand many students may face similar problems created by our lovely traditional Asian parents, especially at a crucial turning point in our lives. The following is my story, and at the end, you get to choose your own story.

I am an 18 year old, currently doing National Service. I just completed A Levels in 2019. I come from a Neighborhood Primary School and a prestigious secondary school, moving on to a neighborhood JC. 

Since Primary school, I was forced to study. At 8 years old. Study at P2. Parents put immense pressure for the results sometimes, and that's just my case. This is the juncture where my parents told me, ""You should aim to become a doctor. You get a very high salary, and you can live a peaceful life"". I was misguided,aiming for a doctor job. I didn't even know there was such a thing called specialist until someone in Secondary School asked me. All I knew was that I was chasing for 'doctor'. As for CCA, my parents forced me into Chess club, where I won awards seldom. I was never interested in Chess. 

In secondary school, Sec 1 and 2, I was one of the brightest kids, topping the cohort and going on stage to receive awards. I didn't really have interests at this point. My parents in this case pushed me into a UG group because the uniform looked good on me, not because of interest. I wanted to join a sport like Floorball, but my parents discouraged me, saying sports is very tiring and I cannot study. Sec 1 was the first time I ever got my handphone. You can tell, my parents have a very traditional mindset. Sec 3 came, and this was where my downfall began. I was forced to take triple science, double humans, double math, English, MT and HMT. That's 10 subjects. The reason my parents chose that combination is because it looks good on my portfolio and shows I am very hard-working. What? Who the f() would choose subjects based on what character it defines? You pick subjects based on your interests. And so, I struggled and struggled. Even teachers were advising me to drop subjects because I couldn't cope. I told my parents I couldn't cope, they told me to persevere. I got an astounding 41 points for prelims, but somehow managed to scrape through O levels with a decent score of 10 points. 

Now came JC life. I already hated O Levels study regime. I wanted to go Poly. Again, having traditional parents, they told me Poly is a waste of time, and a diploma is useless. My 12 options for JAE application were all JC, not a single trace of poly course. Even then, I couldn't choose what JC I wanted to go. My parents forced me to choose the JC nearest to my house, which happened to be AJC. The fact that I have been raised as a single child and sheltered one did not give me the ability to choose. My freedom was taken away, I felt like a caged bird. I cried entering JC, I didn't already like the first 2 weeks. The workload kept piling, and I kept struggling. I was forced to join a slack CCA like Drama, and couldn't choose a sports CCA or even something like council. Do note, at this point, my academics may be a something, but personality and skills wise, I was a complete zero. I didn't master a single skill, even simple ones like public speaking or playing a musical instrument. End of J1 came. I did badly, but was given an Advance notice. I had the ability to choose to retain and strengthen my foundations or advance to JC2. Oh btw, I was taking PCMe, the standard combination across the entire Singapore for those who don't know what to do. I didn't honestly know what I wanted to do in the future. I told my parents, I wanted to explore the poly route and do something like engineering. They said ""No you must become doctor. Doctor is the best"". So poly was a taboo. Then I said, ""Can I at least retain and strengthen the foundations?"" and they said ""I have an image to keep in front of my colleagues. What if you see your juniors from last time. Won't you feel shameful? Won't I feel shameful? Retaining is a shame. You can get out of the house if you choose to retain or go poly"". I had no choice, but advanced to JC2. I joined Yoth Corps Singapore Leaders Programme as a hobby to take my mind off studies. My parents told me to quit immediately after just 2 months. My mental resilience I obtained from Youth Corps was gone. I struggled. Prelims was horrible with 5 rankpoints. A Levels? Don't even ask. I got 50 rankpoints. A miserable E for PCMe, GP, but an A for PW. Even my results tell you I am more suited for poly, project work is fun and manageable for me. I am more of an independent and practical learner, and theory, mugging, regurgitation, vomiting TYS and past year papers never worked for me. Even after my results and months of childing, my parents never understood the point. They told me to retake A Levels in NS. 

I turned 18. I was studying in NS with no drive. Even when I didn't want to study or was lazy, I was blessed to have section mates who would wake me up way early and remind me to study. I didn't tell them I didn't have interest in retaking A's. I just told them I was retaking. Then this CB came. CB is actually a blessing in disguise for me.

Everyone around me told me to study. I didn't. Instead, I used this precious time to reflect on my mistakes, my fitness, my skills, my future. A lot of thinking was done. I wrote a journal entry every single day to see how I was feeling. 

Finally, I came up with a gameplan. How to develop my skills, and joining Poly after my ORD. I am soon telling about this plan to my parents. It's 3am in the morning, and I'm wondering about their reaction to my news. This time, I will argue with them to follow my interests, or even have to fight for my future. These are my rights, I deserve a choice, and I get to choose my future. This is my voice. I have just started a personal blog. You can PM me for the link!
Keep in mind, I just started a few days ago to develop my skills as a freelance blogger!This blog will entertain suggestion on new issues, and I hope to get my point across to everyone;

Always follow your interest, and have a plan for your future. You get to make, or break your own story. You choose, because this is YOUR VOICE.

EDIT: It worked!! My mother was more accepting to what I wanted to do, and I can join poly soon :) Thank you everyone for personally writing into the comments section, it means a lot that you have read through the post.

EDIT 2: Since many of y'all are asking, I'll just plug the link to my blog here; amperiple.wordpress.com

EDIT 3: Things took a huge turn after I confessed to my dad I had no interest in retaking A's. A large argument broke out, but I am getting a chance to pursue a degree in Biomed in another country. My life is on course, but my parents have become more understanding, and are the backbone of this opportunity.

9,[O levels] Best chinese situational writing,"This was sent in my mt class chat:

So I decided to dick around for the email. Hopefully this helps everyone pull the bell curve down.

你好！太久没收到你的电邮了，我还以为你不爱我了。今天我看到你的电邮，眼睛（i wrote this in pinyin LOL）亮起来。但是我读你的电邮后，才发现原来你只要我的帮助。你那里可以这样对我？我也有心情的。。。

算了。我来帮你这个烂人吧。我带我的海外学生去走新加坡的路，走来走去我发现你很像新加坡，一样美丽！！

你也可以带他去吃我们新加坡的食物，像鸡饭。这会让他留下来很美好的回忆，跟一个美女吃饭！其实我也要吃你的鸡饭哈哈哈

你应该特别注意他是什么样的人。我希望他不是帅哥，把你从我身边抢走。修华，别走。。。。

希望你后不回后悔没选择我，最不起我不能让你够开心。你坚持着说要走，说他比我要帅（i forgot how to write 温柔），我终于安静放了手。。。

他妈的你这样的女人拍拍屁股走了，别再打扰我了

10,[RANT] stfu ur not gonna fail.,"posting this only because i rlly cannot tahan liao

do yall have that ONE friend that would keep rambling about how their going to fail before sitting for the papers BUT still manage to get a good grade? (aka hIGHEST IN thE cOHORT -.-)

its like, we understand that youre feeling stressed. we understand that you have zero confidence in yourself. but it wont hurt to maybe, spare a thought for those that arent doing as well as you are? its very demoralizing -- and kinda annoying.

everyone's stressed out for o's, everyone's trying to do their last minute revision, everyone's trying to cramp every last detail of that fucking math formula. so please, PLEASE, stop screaming about how youre going to fail. youre not going to fail. so for the sake of everyone around you, please stfu.

EDIT: glad to see that i’m not alone on this matter! after o levels let’s throw our textbooks/notes in their faces yea

EDIT 2: i’m honestly shOOked that this thread is the first under “hottest”. thank you sm for all the upvotes! AND JIAYOUS FOR THE REST OF THE PAPERS ✨

\----

EDIT 3

some things i've gathered from your comments that i found pretty helpful:

if you're really affected by their behavior, you could do the following:

* be dry aF, or just plainly ignore them. dont bother entertaining them.
* use earphones! listen to music to block out the noise xd
* ask them to stfu. not literally la, like ""hEY sorry im trying to focus on this so could you not talk for a moment?""
* tell them about their behavior. point out how their actions have been negatively affecting you. HOPEFULLY, they'll understand and try to change.

at the same time, as a friend, you should look out for them. as said before, everyone's stressed af. they could be under a hell lot of pressure to obtain good grades. HOWEVER, this does not mean that you should neglect your own mental wellbeing by allowing urself to 'absorb' this negativity.

otherwise, stay strong! try ur best to ignore them, as i believe that most of them are doing it as a habit/expression of stress and do not have the motive of bothering u. (unless theyre doing it for attention la, then that's a whole other story..) but yuhh, all the best for the remaining papers! if yall are feeling stressed by that person/o levels/school, or just wanna vent, feel free to slide into my dms! im here if yall need a listening ear",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jfaodn/rant_stfu_ur_not_gonna_fail/,True,2020-10-22 02:59:46

12,[Rant] to the students at Tampines hub,"Please stop leaving your stuff overnight. 

I wake up early Everyday this week to reach Tampines hub at 7, all to realise that every single table has been taken, yet with no human presence. Your books and notes fill table after table, “choping” your tables day after day, with some even leaving your blank pieces of paper and empty pencil cases throughout the week. You’re depriving others of using a public space. You’re entitled to using the tables, but please be considerate and come early Everyday to use the tables, not chope it for indefinite periods of time. My friends tell me to remove your stuff so that we can find a table to sit at 715am but I’m half-paiseh half-guilty If I decide to remove your stuff. 

I understand that you want a space and table to study, but that’s where it’s incredibly inconsiderate to leave your stuff there to reserve the table to blatantly deprive others of the same space despite them reaching earlier.

I was there yesterday and after 10mins of finding, I managed to find a table outdoors when most tables indoors were reserved but empty. I was there at 7am, unable to find seats, when you and your group of friends would comfortably walk into Tampines hub at 10-11am to the table you’ve placed your stuff on.

Please be considerate.


Edit: okay so Tampines hub’s management has started asking people to remove their stuff on other tables.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ipijo9/rant_to_the_students_at_tampines_hub/,True,2020-09-10 07:52:37
13,[O Levels] Please don't undermine private tutors in this time of need,"I'm a private tutor. I run a small tuition centre. After deducting rent, marketing & administrative costs - I take home around $2500 a month. I teach more than 10 classes weekly.

It has been a very demoralising few weeks.

1. Amidst the suspension of centre-based tuition classes - parents have asked for discount on fees. I tried to help whenever I can by waiving off fees or giving discounts, knowing fully that it will be at my own expense.

Yet, I've received a lot of comments from parents who do not have financial difficulties, going ""e-learning should be cheaper"".

e-Learning IS not cheaper than classroom based learning. It has been 2 sleepless weeks with this mad scramble to move classes online. We've had to to spend sessions doing orientation for you and your children to help explain how to do classes online. We had to buy IT equipment, video recording equipment - all of it not cheap with my measly $2500 monthly salary.

You think it's less effort - it's not. It's more effort and more work. And you want to pay us less.

Please don't undermine our efforts by requesting to pay us less. If you have financial difficulties, we will discount for you. But don't say ""e-Learning should be paid less"". Thanks.

Rental still goes on - landlords who don't take the initiative to help and pass on rental rebates, I'm looking at YOU!

2. We totally understand that why we have been closed down. Health comes first - sure.

However, can don't call us non-essential?

School is essential, tuition is non-essential. Minister said that. True facts of life.

But, but. Can you also see this.

In every sector, there are good people and there are bad people.

In the tuition sector, there are some of us good ones and some of us bad ones.

I dare say, I care about each and every-one of my students. I do my best to motivate. I do my best to talk to them when they have family troubles. I come up with extra worksheets when I know they are lagging behind.

In schools, you also have teachers who are not motivated, who only come to school for the paycheck and do the minimum.

If all school teachers are good - need tuition teachers for what?

If everybody scoring A1, A2 and A\* - then no need for tuition. Some parents find tuition because their kids have been failing.

We don't need you to recognise us. But don't call us non-essential can?

3. Common comment from school teachers and from the public - ""They should pay school teachers more"" or ""Tuition teachers make so much money"".

You know how many times I roll my eyes at this?

Straits Times - I'm looking at you. Thanks for always reporting on ""million dollar"" tutors. Now everybody thinks that all tutors make millions.

Reality check - If you are a school teacher and you think you will make a lot of money leaving the public sector, feel free to go try your luck.

Is every school teacher a Principal? or a Cluster Superintendent? or a Director? No right?

Same thing with the private sector ok? The top tutors make a lot of money. The normal tutors like us make close to the 'median' $4600 of the typical Singaporean.

We don't have CPF.

We don't have AWS.

We don't have performance bonus.

In November & December, we eat bread but still pay rent.

Whatever we earn in 10 months, must ration across 12 months, because November & December parents go holiday and don't want tuition.

No - regular tutors don't make millions.

Stop dreaming. Most school teachers are not zai. If they leave the public sector, they will eat grass.

I make $2500 a month - if you feel that is fantastic, you can be my guest. You have a choice. If you think you can make more as a private tutor, take the plunge into the world of the unknown.

4. Teachers got a lot of admin work, not like private tutor only need to teach

We don't have admin work. We have ""admin work"" - marketing, accounting & trying to keep the business alive. We don't only teach.

You have a 'clear thick' line between yourself and parents. We don't. We are obligated to answer, and talk to parents everyday. Do you know there are parents who call us and talk to us everyday about their kids and their anxieties? (a lot of parents from top schools are actually very anxious about their kids) I spend 1 to 2 hours daily talking to 2 to 3 parents everyday.

5. Thank you for classifying us together with KTVs, Bars & Entertainment

I called the bank to lower my credit card interest because in anticipation of school closures, I invested heavily in video recording equipment and IT equipment that I actually cannot pay for with my measly salary.

Guess what the bank said? You are not from an eligible 'adversely affected' sector.

Adversely affected = tourism, aviation, F&B and entertainment.

Entertainment qualifies but private education doesn't qualify.

Again, i understand why we have been shut down. But can everyone remember us private tutors have families to feed too? Mortgages or rent to pay? Bills to pay?

6. We are human beings too

We have feelings. We have empathy. We have tried to help whenever we can. My tuition centre offers free tuition all these years to whomever are on MOE Financial Assistance scheme. When parents face difficulties (retrenched, fell sick), we always cut our fees or give free. When students ask for extra help, we coach and we don't charge extra.

We are trying our best too. Really. We are all in this together.

I don't know since when being a 'private tutor' is a nasty thing.

Maybe tuition centres like Learning Lab, Mavis Tutorial or any of those big tuition centres with big MRT and bus adverts and sprawling land space of more than 10000 square feet might make millions of dollars a year. Maybe they have strong investors with hundreds of millions. But hey that's not us. Don't assume that we have a mountain of profits to stomach this because we don't.

Also, a lot of our kids and a lot of our parents always tell us that school teachers always say bad things about private tutors. ""Tuition is a waste of money"", ""don't need go for tuition"", ""private tutors are not qualified and don't know what they are teaching"".

Some teachers seem to spend a lot of time bad-mouthing private tutors.

Grass always seem to be greener on the other side.

You get your bonuses, your CONNECT plan, your PB and your 13th month. When the economy does well - you get extra money for doing absolutely nothing extra.

2 to 3 year 'old' Teachers pay around $5k to $6k. HOD teachers pay is ""7k to 10k"". VPs more. Ps on Superscale can make $200+ k per year. Stop making comparisons and keep saying private tutors make more.

Just focus on teaching your kids please. You still have a job.

I may not have one when the dust settles.

Also, remember that a lot of us private tutors were once school teachers.

Some of us left because of school mergers.

Some of us left because we were pregnant, had kids and could no longer cope.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with this thing called EPMS.

Some of us left because we don't want to deal with all the politics, committees, organising overseas trips and want to just focus on the kids.

Please support your tutors, thank you. A lot of us, really do care, genuinely for your child.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fteaxs/o_levels_please_dont_undermine_private_tutors_in/,True,2020-04-02 18:38:18
14,[Rant] If you think you did badly in O Levels,"Dear young friends, I am a concerned mom who happened to stumble upon this reddit. I know some of you have expressed your sadness and disappointment over your O level results. Before I carry on, I like to say that you all have come a long way and you should be proud of yourselves. Yes, it sucks if you did not meet your expectations, and it is hard to feel proud, but you all should!! 

It may really stink right now and you think the future will not be great. I hope to dispel this misconception. No one knows what the future holds. We carry on because believe me, life presents to us all kinds of surprises, the good, the bad and the ugly. We carry on, taking it all...gaining wisdom,
strength and confidence along the way. No doubt some of you may even wish to resit the Os but are unable to. We all make mistakes -we are humans, we are allowed to fail- but we are allowed to get up too, as long as we've learnt from our mistakes. Whatever has happened, don't dwell on  too much ...MOVE ON...level up! Keep looking forward! Nothing is a dead end!! When you look back, this will only be a tiny chapter of your life. It will not matter! Really!! 

I noticed many of you felt that you disappointed your parents. Don't feel such guilt over trying to meet their expectations- especially if they've been unrealistic, or have employed methods such as threats, guilt trips or other pressure(isations.) (on us to be a good role models to our younger siblings). (Whatever tactics they may use,) please know that in the end, your achievements are for yourself. Most importantly, I want you to be doing something ONLY FOR YOURSELF. Life should never about meeting the expectations or approval of others. We do'nt owe anyone anything; you matter most of all to yourself! From now on, make the best of any situation and carry on. Do your best, do not compare with others, strive to be a better version of yourself FOR YOURSELF! 

Remember you matter, and that you are precious. Remember to love yourself...be kind to yourself. 

I hope this helps in some way and do share this with someone if you think it may help them. You can get through this! Life is more than exams. I wish you all the best for your future.

Edit: Thank you for all the awards! I didn't expect it, and didn't know such things existed...as you can probably tell from my account age, I don't use reddit very often. Please kindly save your coins and award for someone else who finds use of it!

15,[o levels] to everyone saying we have it easy,"the grass is always greener on the other side, yes we don't have organic chem and vectors but we had to study for Os during a pandemic. 

people who can't focus at home had no alternative. people who don't have conducive environments couldn't go to libraries.
people felt demotivated and couldn't focus during HBL which is super understandable coz it was unprecedented and technically Os doesn't test us on how to be adaptable.

plus, the bell curve moderates everybody to about the same every year, so they don't dish out extra As just bc the paper was fairly easy.

16,[META] Story about how we are conditioned to learn,"I saw this shared around, and felt like it represents our experience in education in Singapore. Do you feel the same way?

\---

“Once a little boy went to school.  
One morning  
The teacher said:  
""Today we are going to make a picture.""  
""Good!"" thought the little boy.  
He liked to make all kinds;  
Lions and tigers,  
Chickens and cows,  
Trains and boats;  
And he took out his box of crayons  
And began to draw.

But the teacher said, ""Wait!""  
""It is not time to begin!""  
And she waited until everyone looked ready.  
""Now,"" said the teacher,  
""We are going to make flowers.""  
""Good!"" thought the little boy,  
He liked to make beautiful ones  
With his pink and orange and blue crayons.  
But the teacher said ""Wait!""  
""And I will show you how.""  
And it was red, with a green stem.  
""There,"" said the teacher,  
""Now you may begin.""

The little boy looked at his teacher's flower  
Then he looked at his own flower.  
He liked his flower better than the teacher's  
But he did not say this.  
He just turned his paper over,  
And made a flower like the teacher's.  
It was red, with a green stem.

On another day  
The teacher said:  
""Today we are going to make something with clay.""  
""Good!"" thought the little boy;  
He liked clay.  
He could make all kinds of things with clay:  
Snakes and snowmen,  
Elephants and mice,  
Cars and trucks  
And he began to pull and pinch  
His ball of clay.

But the teacher said, ""Wait!""  
""It is not time to begin!""  
And she waited until everyone looked ready.  
""Now,"" said the teacher,  
""We are going to make a dish.""  
""Good!"" thought the little boy,  
He liked to make dishes.  
And he began to make some  
That were all shapes and sizes.

But the teacher said ""Wait!""  
""And I will show you how.""  
And she showed everyone how to make  
One deep dish.  
""There,"" said the teacher,  
""Now you may begin.""

The little boy looked at the teacher's dish;  
Then he looked at his own.  
He liked his better than the teacher's  
But he did not say this.  
He just rolled his clay into a big ball again  
And made a dish like the teacher's.  
It was a deep dish.

And pretty soon  
The little boy learned to wait,  
And to watch  
And to make things just like the teacher.  
And pretty soon  
He didn't make things of his own anymore.

Then it happened  
That the little boy and his family  
Moved to another house,  
In another city,  
And the little boy  
Had to go to another school.

The teacher said:  
""Today we are going to make a picture.""  
""Good!"" thought the little boy.  
And he waited for the teacher  
To tell what to do.  
But the teacher didn't say anything.  
She just walked around the room.

When she came to the little boy  
She asked, ""Don't you want to make a picture?""  
""Yes,"" said the little boy.  
""What are we going to make?""  
""I don't know until you make it,"" said the teacher.  
""How shall I make it?"" asked the little boy.  
""Why, anyway you like,"" said the teacher.  
""And any color?"" asked the little boy.  
""Any color,"" said the teacher.  
And he began to make a red flower with a green stem. “

18,[RANT] I didn't shade my PSLE OAS.,"# Edit: FRIENDS, THIS IS A SUCESS STORY! THIS HAPPENED A FEW YEARS AGO AND I MANAGED TO GET THE QN BOOKLET MARKED!

This post is a response to [yesterday's post](https://np.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j3qb66/rant_please_help_i_didnt_shade_my_oas/), where a P6 student shared how they didn't shade their OAS MCQ for their maths PSLE.

Some years ago, when I took my PSLE science paper, I didn't shade the OAS. I only noticed this when the paper was being collected. Right as I handed the OAS in, I told the invigilator about this. And although I can't remember the event quite clearly, I remember the invigilator being very understanding and reassuring me of how he'd help to the best of his capabilities. What I do remember quite clearly was him **not** scolding me for not shading it, or blaming me for being careless.

After that, my parents came down and spoke to the VP (or principal, I can't remember), and letters were passed to the MOE. Eventually, they agreed to mark my answer booklet. In the end, I got an A* for PSLE science.

If you don't shade an OAS for a national exam, having written the answers in your booklet, you need to **tell the invigilator immediately**—especially for the O- and A-levels, where you are allowed to take your question booklet home. This will allow the invigilator to collect your answer booklet and get in touch with the relevant authorities as soon as possible.

You'll also need to get your parents and the school involved. My VP was very reassuring and helpful during the incident, doing his best to make sure that I'd have my paper marked, and I don't think it would've been marked without his intervention. **Do not** write directly to the MOE/SEAB or call their hotline. Please don't feel inadequate or stupid: you'll need to reach out to the adults around you if you want to have a good chance at getting your paper marked. Everyone wants you to have a fair grade, and no one wants your future to be affected just because of an honest mistake.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j49i6n/rant_i_didnt_shade_my_psle_oas/,True,2020-10-03 20:23:16
19,"[O levels] ""It's too late to start studying...""","(Tagged with O level flair but applies to A levels too!)

Don’t let the notion that “there’s only xx days to O/A levels, it’s too late to start studying” deter you. 

A*nything worth doing is worth doing badly.* Sounds weird? I for one thought it was batsh\*t insane when I first heard it. In Singapore, for most of us, the pressure to excel and be perfect, to be able to give our 110% and perform at 110% all the time, is crazy. We criticise ourselves so readily, demand 110% of ourselves in every facet of our lives. You are either perfect or a failure—no in-between. If you didn't spend xx amount of time studying for your exam, you've already failed; no point trying anymore.

*Anything worth doing is worth doing badly.* Study 4 hours if you can't study 8! Study 2 chapters if you can't study 4! 50% effort is better than 0% effort. You're already 100% better off compared to when you started. *Something is better than nothing.* 

*Anything worth doing is worth doing badly.* It's much easier said than done, but sometimes, the ""all-or-nothing"" mindset that is so ingrained into our culture does more harm than good. ""Anything worth doing is worth doing well"" is a phrase I'm sure many of you have heard from parents/relatives. It basically translates to ""if you're not going to do it well, then don't do it"". It might be useful in some situations, but in this case, I'd argue that something is better than nothing.

*It is enough that you tried your best.* I come from a family that really prioritised grades (mums meeting up with other mums and the only thing they talk about is your achievements, or lack thereof, anyone?). I had to learn to be okay with giving my best effort even if said effort didn't yield the results I wanted. My parents would always claim that if my results were subpar, it meant that I didn't put in enough work. But, I'm sure you all know, sometimes it doesn't work like that. Sometimes sh\*t happens and we just have to roll with it.

*It is enough that you tried your best.* 

You might still end up regretting not starting earlier if you don't get the grades you want; I don't want to sugarcoat it. But don't you think your chances of getting those grades are going to be higher even with 2 weeks of work than with none at all?

The finish line is close. You're almost done. You are doing so well. And whatever the result, *I am proud of you.*

21,[RANT] It's time for Singaporean students to embrace the arts,"Ever wondered why Mediacorp shows are so unwatchable?

Not only are they chock full of *poorly concealed* government related messages and silly slapstick humour and annoyingly repetitive plots. Seriously, even my grandmother is so bored of CH8 dramas that she prefers watching the Taiwan/HK/Korea shows.

I mean no disrespect. Government messages are important and beneficial to our society BUT not at the expense of having our viewer count drop to zero. If you want to spread a message, at least make shows that locals want to watch. Many people across Quora and other platforms share my sentiments. **But the problem here is shoehorning and bad storytelling, not the messages.**

It's not like we need huge budgets for good filmmaking - people have made award winning features using their iPhone 7's which was by the way released many years ago. And what do we waste our ARRI and RED cameras on? Filming painfully pathetic shows that I scoff at every time I walk past my television.

I mean, look at Netflix and other Asian shows if we want an example of making good non-propaganda shows. I have yet to see a drama from the United States that aggressively pushes anti-vaxx and ""Voting is important!"" every moment they can. They focus on big ideas like friendship and love, within a larger genre of perhaps horror or adventure or even simply in the city, and THEN they add subtle commentary on society. Show, don't tell. That is how they win their audience over.

And it's not just in film and TV. It's the whole culture. 

Theatre, visual arts, animation, music. If we want to be world class in those domains, there has to be something we can do about it.

**This brings me to my point on education and careers in the arts.**

Ever used the term ""artsy fartsy"" to describe someone who is arts inclined? I'm sorry to say this, but that is a really efficient way to enforce the stereotype that arts people are full of shit and ideas too faraway for the layman to grasp. It paints an image of being a societal outcast, deviating from the proper lawyer/doctor/engineer/teacher that we should have been if only we were smart enough to enter the science stream. 

Yes, do you see the problem here?

In almost every JC, arts stream COP is higher than science stream COP. People who accidentally land in arts desperately appeal to go to science stream. Not because they know they want to be a doctor or engineer, but because the arts has no future.

Students are encouraged to take triple science. Triple science students are seen as the smartest kids in secondary school.

Art schools like NAFA and Lasalle are last resorts, not for our brightest artistic talents but for people who are at the end of their rope. Even the Art/Design/Media school in NTU has one of the lowest 10th pctl scores in the entire university. Subjects like Literature and Theatre Studies are not as well ranked as subjects like Economics and Law. Now, this is not unique to Singapore, but here the problem is really a lot worse.

Words like ""no future"", ""go scrape a living see if SRT* accept you"", ""if only you passed science you could have been a doctor!"", ""you are so bright why do you waste your life like this?!""... Guys, I'm sure you are not foreign to the concept that words CAN affect people. An Arts student who wishes to go far will very quickly have their boldness stamped down to size not because they can't but because so many people tell them they are a fool for choosing this route.

*Singapore Repertory Theatre. A name that most Singaporeans aren't even familiar with, unfortunately. 

It doesn't help that the concept of artsy-fartsy is drilled into children from a young age. By parents who mean well but they think that science is the only way to a good career. And unfortunately they are right. Because the way our society is structured, we set our Arts students up for failure. 

We look outwards for entertainment. The media does little to feature our local arts. We want to cling on to names, and we do - to the likes of Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga, Beyonce, Taylor Swift, BTS, SNSD. Can we have the name of a new local star that is an international household name please? I'll wait. 

So to all those starry eyed music students with voices that resemble angels from heaven, and to all those film students who dream of directing their own Disney-esque films... It's not impossible. But it's going to be very, VERY hard to launch something locally.

Which is what we really want to do at the end of the day. Arts students, some of us at least, we dream of building a Singapore who leads the world not just in refining oil and GDP per capita but also in pop culture. We want little kids around the world to sing our songs and believe in them and dream of visiting this centre of arts and entertainment one day. We want our art to make Singapore proud. We want to succeed as much as the Science students.

Some of you might think that my writing all of this is so pointless. What can a single online rant do?

That's the power of art. I make it once and I can touch a million more hearts, stir desires and create ambition. You have that power too.

Please don't shy away from that arts degree even if your grades are higher than the minimum. Life isn't about following the normal. It's about creating a legacy.

If you're in Arts stream, all is not lost. In fact, nothing is lost at all. You are discovering another world, an untapped gold mine of opportunities. 

To all Sec 4 kids, I would like you to just - even very briefly - consider a future in the arts.

We may all be single individuals with little power, but everything begins with one person. If we all connect with each other, if we build our own industry, create opportunities, push each other upwards, learn, grow, soar, we CAN succeed.

There are more people interested in the arts than you know. I have friends who have art IG accounts with a following of close to 20k, I have family members setting up their own boy band and trying to build connections with people across the Asian entertainment industry. I found out, by pure accident, that one of my friends shared the same profound love as I do for musical theatre. What were the chances?!

But you know what? I'm starting to think that there is so much more of us hidden talents and passionate people who concealed ourselves in favour of a job that may not even be what we like. Sure, there are many other industries that are more essential to the survival of the nation but I'm not asking us to just drop everything and join the arts industry. I'm asking that we improve our standards and become a force to be reckoned with on the world stage.

Singapore has potential, guys. So, so, so much potential. I wish we could see it and that is why I have spent the last 2 hours typing this.

I believe in you, guys. I believe in our future and I believe that someday we WILL rise.

Arts may not appear like the No.1 road to fame and fortune but we have to work hard if we want to build it ourselves. Our forefathers can build a first world nation from a swamp and kampungs. Surely we can create a world class centre for the arts true to its name. Let Marina Bay Sands and The Esplanade and every major theater in the world witness a Singapore story.

22,[O Levels] Private Candidate semi-love story,"hey guys, so this year, i was retaking my exams at MOE HQ Bishan. I have been noticing this guy who always sit behind me for every exam. He has really short spiked hair, super tall and muscular, pink IC . The other day, i forgot to bring my curve ruler so he happened to be around me and i asked him. He lent it to me and thanked me instead of the other way round. Afterwards, he told me about why his calculator was not allowed in the exam for paper 2. He seemed like he wasn't a retaker because he brought in a calculator which was meant for JC and could potentially display graphs. When i was packing my bag to leave, i could feel his eyes looking at me and wanted to strike a conversation. However, i was really shy and i just walked away. I truly regret not telling him that the English LC was my last paper. He might be thinking I am still coming for the rest of the papers. I'm so upset i missed my chance to say goodbye and i cried because i was filled with agony. 

It felt as though;

""see you tomorrow""
""Okay see ya""

23,[O Levels] DO NOT CHECK ANSWERS.,"I graduated from Sec School in 2019 (last year O lvl batch) and this tip saved me.

**Do NOT check or read through the answers after any paper.** 

The only ones who do this are those who are extremely smart and or confident in themselves. If you're an average student like me, not checking or looking through answers after your paper might be the best decision you will make during this period. 

It is extremely simple. Checking the answers after a paper can demoralize/demotivate you significantly. 

The answers which are uploaded after a paper are usually from tuition centres which **may not be extremely credible at all.** For example, after my 2019 English P2 Os, my friend showed me the answers uploaded online and I was supposedly ""wrong"" for many qns. However, I ended up getting an A2 and my English teacher from my school actually agreed with my answers as well. 

These answers do not take bell-curve, markers leniency and many other factors into account. So don't feel down if your answers are wrong because it truly is not the end of the world.

Checking for answers after a paper which you feel like you've done bad for is the worst. Lie to yourself that it wasn't that bad and that you may still pass if you feel like you've performed badly for a paper. If you confront the truth and calculate your marks, its going to be 10x tougher to perform for your remaining papers knowing that you've done badly for one paper.

Remember that during this time, confidence and mental health is just as if not more important than your actual knowledge. Go in with confidence and tell yourself that you will try your best!

25,"[Rant] does anyone agree that Os (or exams in sg in general) is not a test of skills or understanding, but a test of memorising and having an narrow mindset?","a really really really long rant about the education system. it’s my own opinions, please don’t flame but who agrees with me?

in my opinion, understanding a subject is not the same as memorising and being able to word vomit everything onto a 2 page essay. understanding doesn’t mean you have to know the process or formation of things by heart, and similarly memorising doesn’t mean you understand, you can just be memorising to answer in the exam and forget it the next moment. doesn’t this mean that by the end of the exams, you don’t learn anything?

i understand that some subs such as geog and history does require memorising and i agree that these subjects have not much way to be tested. but then again, what skills do we gain? if we are going to pursue careers that are related to these subjects, that’s great, but if not, then wouldn’t it be a waste of time? the only values and perhaps skills that we learn will probably be burning the midnight oil to memorise 2 full textbooks of content that we possibly won’t use in the future &amp; maybe learning how to persevere through the pain of memorising.

this is the same of the non-content subjects like math and amath. we are not learning the skills but instead are memorising the solution structures of different questions. sure understanding plays a part too, but half the time, it’s just equation-vomiting. i say narrow mindset is because when we are taught a certain way of answering questions, we will only copy and paste, not coming up with a different solution to the question. we are taught that only a certain method or answering structure will get us the marks, discouraging us from forming new solutions which will perhaps broaden our perspective on day to day realities.

for the lit, come on. we are just memorising the points our teacher spoon-feeds us and are not thinking on our own. lit is all about inferring and reading between the line, but seriously, out of everyone in singapore, barely anyone does that. have you ever thought why is it that for lit papers, poems are the most badly done? it’s because we don’t a teacher there to spoon-feed us answers in the exam.

overall, i seriously think the structure of our exams are detrimental to your development and mental health. it doesn’t promote learning, but instead promotes sacrificing-self-care-to-achieve-results-that-ultimately-defines-our-intelligence-in-singapore. the worst part is, we grow up to chase the results and end up losing many years of our life which could have been used to learn how to respect, love and be aware of other things around the world. we are all monsters, fighting for ourselves, with a narrow perspective. this is why most singaporeans eventually grow up to be competitive, cold and purpose-less.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jid7ub/rant_does_anyone_agree_that_os_or_exams_in_sg_in/,True,2020-10-27 03:59:08

27,[META] After 12 Years of Education,"I'm finishing my A levels this week, with the final paper in 2 days. I wish to end this journey on a concluding statement of sorts, as I'm taking a break now and because on Friday I'll be too busy celebrating to pen my thoughts down. See, I'm the type of person who needs closure when an event as big as this has just ended. I wish to ponder and reflect, not only over the past month, but also over the course of 2 years in JC and my education in Singapore as a whole. Hopefully I'll also be able to sum up the feelings and personal experiences I've had throughout the years in a succinct way. Well, here goes nothing...


After 12 years of education, I take a close look in the mirror. I see the scars from acne, from razor blades cutting my skin as I shaved the unkempt facial hair under my nose. I see the imperfections that my Primary School friend used to tease me for - and he'd draw a stupid cartoon of me. I see dark circles around my eyes. I see eyebags: a physical manifestation of those late nights spent doing God-knows-what, wondering if it was all worth it in the end. I take a closer look deep into my eyes. After 12 years of education, I see a changed man.


After 12 years of education, I glance over to my Father's face. His eyes were glued on the Premier League match on TV. A proven sportsman himself, I wonder if I ever made him proud. Growing up, I've been rejected by the school team multiple times. No amount of money spent on boots could improve my skills. When JC came, I thought I had my big break. Turns out, I was rejected in J1 once again, only to have COVID cancel A Divs in my second year. After 12 years of education, I failed to make my Father proud.


After 12 years of education, I look at the Teddy Bears sitting in my room. Some were procured from graduation, and one particular Teddy was absent: the product of a mans dedication to simping. I remember giving her the best Teddy Bear I ever had. I sure hope she cuddles Mr. Softie to sleep. I gave up 8 days worth of lunch money just to buy a present for her birthday. All I got was a ""thank you"". Did I expect for more? Maybe. Maybe I just wanted to be loved. Like something parental affection could not provide. Or maybe I'm just overthinking shit lol. I never would have received proper love at that age. After 12 years of education, I learnt to be realistic.


After 12 years of education, I peer through an old pencil case. A large stack of notes wrapped in translucent plastic were held together by a broken zipper. I sift through them. Notes from graduation and POP rekindle fond memories of secondary school life. For some senders, I still treat them like brothers til today. For others, I really wonder how they are doing right now. The world is a funny place; we boast about connectedness but I've already lost contact with some. I hope you're doing well, wherever you are. After 12 years of education, I learnt to treasure people before it's too late.


After 12 years of education, I move the huge stack of notes from my table into a filled cupboard. It exposed the bottom of the table below it - which I have not seen for months. I sat down to stare at the noticeboard in front of me: a calendar nailed by a thumbtack pointing to the 27th of November, and a photocopied entry proof with lines across every subject title except the Final one. On Friday, it will be the last time I sit for a Cambridge and SEAB exam. Never again. (God Forbid)(HOPEFULLY). I close my eyes and picture the euphoria of walking out of the exam centre, planning my celebrations for the 2 months ahead. After 12 years of education, I am officially done.

28,[Rant] Trash parents that think they’re the best.,"My parents are micromanaging, controlling, and have very volatile tempers. They install 2 screentime applications on my phone to restrict everything I do. They want to know everywhere I’ve been to and such.

I’m just really fed up because they won’t shut up about how amazing they are and how hard it was for them. I accidentally deleted one of the screentime applications they installed, and both came raging and screaming at me and wouldn’t listen to me.

They link everything to my phone usage (including my muscle atrophy, migraines, and breathing problems), and even though I’m only using my phone right now, my phone was hot because I listened to music on the way back and the weather was very hot. They kept on insisting that my phone was hot because I used it.

Time limit is 2 hrs daily for my phone. I generally use my phone to read mangas and novels, research, arrange school stuff (I’m a leader), contact teachers, and game a bit to relieve stress. However, my parents keep insisting that I use my phone from 6 am to 7pm , forgetting that they installed the screentime app on my phone. They restricted all the games on my phone so I can’t play at all, and I’m just so sick and tired of this.

Furthermore, I was about to do some O level papers, but my parents just kept on scolding me and saying I’ll keep on using my phone, and now I don’t feel like doing anything. 

Every time I meet my parents, they always criticise me and run their mouth about everything. I can’t exactly ignore them otherwise they’ll beat the crap out of me. My mother acts all innocent and like she’s always correct when she’s the one always instigating all the fights and beatings and brings up ideas that make my life worse. The only thing they care about is my phone usage and marks. They said that they’ll disown me if I don’t get into a JC.

They always say that I only got good PSLE results because of the tuitions they forced me to attend, when the tuition is crap as heck and I didn’t learn anything from it. During the years leading up to PSLE they forced me to take ballet and piano as well, and I hated them. I like piano if I wasn’t forced to learn, and ballet made all my muscles and bones very painful.

They keep calling me an ungrateful kid and trash and shit and useless, and say that I don’t know respect and how to be thankful. Idk if this counts as mental abuse because of how often they tell me I’m useless and a waste...

sigh.

They insist that the only reason they install two screentime apps on my phone is because I cannot manage my own screentime, which I consider a bullshit reason. They only want to control me. Even my little brother gets to play the PS4 and watch YouTube with his friends all day long. (He’s getting his phone soon)

Honestly, I feel that they’re the real children here, with control over my life, screwing me over. They’ve become worse and worse especially in the past 2 years and I can’t take it anymore. (This started since P3)

I’m just so tired of this. I’ve contemplated suicide many times, but the pain of suicide steers me from killing myself. Someday, however, I know I’m going to snap.

The reason why I’m posting here anonymously is because the last time I confided in someone, they told my parents and I got the shit beaten out of me.

EDIT: I forgot to mention that I was kicked out of the house for a few hours before even though I wasn’t at fault. It was end of tuition and I couldn’t reach them because my phone was under screentime and I went back to my house by myself. They couldn’t reach me apparently, and decided it was my fault so they beat me and kicked me out.

EDIT 2: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH FOR THE ENCOURAGEMENT AND SUPPORT! There’s so many people out there facing or have faced the same problem as I am currently facing, and it really warms the cockles of my heart knowing that we’ll get through this together!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iy52s5/rant_trash_parents_that_think_theyre_the_best/,True,2020-09-23 22:38:44
29,[O Level] English Paper 1 And 2 Tips 2020,"Hi there! Js wanted to share what I've garnered over the weeks of study break and thought it might help anyone out there who is struggling in English!

Edit: Wrote the list of attitudes/tones/mood applicable for Paper 2 Section B

Edit 2: I've added in introduction examples for you to reference\~

&#x200B;

>\[ English - Paper 1 \]

Editing - Not much to say! But try to get at least 7 or above :)

**Classification of Errors**

This list of the types of errors that you will find in editing passages

Do note that the list is non-exhaustive.

1. Tense

&#x200B;

    This is when the incorrect tense is used. Using the word “do” as an example, types of tenses include:
    
    	\- Present (“do”)
    
    	\- Past (“did”)
    
    	\- Past Participle (“done”)
    
    	\- Future (“will do”)

&#x200B;

2.    Preposition

    Prepositions are words that show the relationship between nouns and phrases in a sentence. Some examples of prepositions are “between”, “in”, “on”, around” and “with”.

 

3.    Determiner

    Determiners are words that used with nouns to refer or point to specific people or things. They are used at the beginning of a noun phrase. Some of them are as follows:
    
    	\- Articles (“a”, “an”, “the”)
    
    	\- Quantifiers (“all”, “no”, “some”, “each”, “many”, “little”, “less”)
    
    	\- Possessives (“his”, “my”, “your”)
    
    	\- Demonstratives (“this”, “these”, “that”, “those”)
    
    	\- Interrogatives (“what”, “which”, “whose”)

 

4.    Subject-Verb Agreement

    This is when there is no agreement between nouns and verbs. (“They is here”; Marry cook every day.) 

 

5.    Conjunction and Connector

    They are connecting words that combine two or more clauses together. Some examples are as follows:
    
    	\- and (to join similar ideas together)
    
    	\- therefore, hence, so (to show cause and effect)
    
    	\- despite, but, nevertheless, although, however, even though (to show contrast or opposition)
    
    	\- because (to show reason)
    
    	\- if, unless (to show possibility based on the existence of a certain condition)
    
    	\- or (to introduce another possibility)

 

6.    Word Class

    This is when the incorrect word class is used. Major word classes include:
    
    	\- Nouns
    
    	\- Verbs
    
    	\- Adjectives
    
    	\- Adverbs

 

7.    Modal

    Modal verbs are used to make requests, suggestions, give advice and express possibility. Some examples are “can”, “should”, “may”, “will” and “must”.2

 

8.    Verb Form

    This is when the incorrect verb form is used. Using the word “do” as an example, verb forms may be formed using:
    
    	\- Infinitive (“to do”)
    
    	\- Present participle (“doing”)
    
    	\- Past participle (“done”)

9.    Noun Form

    This is when plural nouns have to be changed to their singular form or to uncountable nouns (and vice versa).

 

10.    Pronoun Form

    This is when the incorrect pronoun is used. 
    
    	\- Subjective pronouns (“I”, “You”, “He”)
    
    	\- Objective pronouns (“me”, “her”, “us”)
    
    	\- Reflexive pronouns (“yourself”, “myself”)
    
    	\- Possessive pronouns (“my”, “mine”, “her”, “hers”)

 

11.    Adjective Form

    This is when wrong adjectival form is used. Some words have more than one adjectival form. For example, “a surprised man” means a man who is shocked, while “a surprising man” refers to a man who shocks others”.

 

12.    Comparatives and Superlatives

This type of error requires you to note how many items you are comparing with. Whenever we see the word “than”, we usually need to use the comparative form (e.g. “worse” instead of “worst”, “less” instead of “least”)

&#x200B;

I have some of my favorite sentences and structures at the back of my head. To avoid me forgetting some of these, what I do is actually write them down immediately once I get the paper, regardless of whether it might fit into the context given. You can always tweak it to the context.

>Composition - I'm a person who prefer to voice out my opinions and give more factual statement so naturally I lean more towards writing Aurgumentative/Discursive. For those looking for Narrative/Expository tips, so sorry I'm not really brilliant in that area hahaha

I've also read a Cambridge report that people tend to use 'All in all' to summarise and end off their conclusion, which will NOT impress the markers due to the prevelant uses by the students.

You can end off by reading the 'Summarizing' part above, or just follow your own heart. By this, I mean that there is no proper way to end it tbvh. As long as there is a note of finality, the job is done.

Take for example, Albert Einstein once said '........'. I stand with his view as it bears witness to how people are......Therefore.....

———————————————————

**Introduction:**

1. The intro should not include all points that will be presented in your subsequent points you are going to state later
2. Make it iinteresting + create suspense
3. Below are some scenarios you can choose from to begin your introduction

**. Start with a general statement**

Many people today choose to go overseas for their vacation and many choose to fly to their destinations. Cheaper airfares, especially offered by budget air carriers, have encouraged tourists to choose air travel over other means of transportation to get to their preferred destinations. Furthermore, with economic globalisation, many jobs nowadays require regional or even international commuting. The increase in air travel has brought about an awareness of issues such as airport security, airplane maintenance and passenger safety, especially with the increase in number as well as intensity of air travel incidents in the past decade. It is my belief that necessary steps have been put in place to ensure air travel.

**. Begin with a Question (2 questions, 1 short sentence etc)**

Why are so many people glued to their computers, playing computer games for hours on end? What is it about computer games that make them so attractive? Many find them entertaining. Do they serve any other purposes beyond mere entertainment? I do think that there are other benefits of playing computer games.

**. Begin with an exclamation (action pack-ed scenario)**

Boom! Bang! Swish! Crash! Sounds from an adventure movie? Oh, no! These are sounds often heard coming from computers today as many, both young and old, male and female, play computer games relentlessly.  Some people think that playing computer games is just a waste of time. However, I believe there are other benefits of playing computer games apart from providing us with entertainment.

**. Begin with a Quotation**

‘The computer is the modern tool of man; it is his friend in the 21st century.’ These are the words of a scientific researcher, and they have raised much thought about how useful a computer can be. However, what we see being done on a computer practically everywhere these days is the playing of computer games. In my opinion, computer games serve other purpose apart from entertainment.

**. Begin with a Scenario(narrative starting, this one is the best to use as people do not commonly integrate them into expository writing)**

In a darkened room, a sixteen-year-old boy sits in front of his computer, his eyes fixated on the moving images in front of him. He clicks his mouse repeatedly, once in a while, letting loose a strong of expletives. On screen, his character jumps over obstacles and readily guns down any enemy that appears in front of him. This boy has not slept, eaten or even bathed in the last 24 hours. One would think this is an extreme and isolated gamer. Yet, he is not alone. Next to him, on his left and on his right, to his front and back, sit others just like him. The same scene is repeated all across the country in the numerous computer gaming cafes that have sprung up. The computer game has become a fixation for many players. Clearly, playing such computer games has many negative consequences. Nevertheless, I feel that there are redeeming features in playing computer games.

**. Unpack one of the key terms**

———————————————————

**Points:**

ALWAYS remember what YOU want to prove to the marker. Don't get caught up in your writing and stray from the question.

**Plan beforehand. Although it may seem silly and a waste of time, you'll be grateful for the plan. It doesn't have to be complex ok!**

**E.g. Teenagers today are selfish. What are your views? (2 Yes/2 No OR 2 Yes/1 No)**

**Yes - Media portrayal**

**No - They have organised meaningful causes**

**Yes - Materialistic = selfish**

**No - Poverty (they are grateful and embrace their state = therefore not selfish)**

&#x200B;

That's it! From there, I just expand my thoughts while I write. I also write out good sentence structures first, in the event that I forget them.

PLEASE do not use bombastic words if you do not know how to utilise them. If you used it wrongly, your point will be totally off and markers will definitely not know what you are trying to get at. Simple yet concise explanation make do as well!

&#x200B;

**Opposing view:**

More often than not, the….

Clearly, ….. Nevertheless, I feel that there are redeeming features in…

However, there is another school of thoughts/beliefs

On the other side of the fence

&#x200B;

>\[ English - Paper 2 \]

Ok! For Paper 2, it's really just based on how well you can answer + how you understand the question

Section A: Visual text

**‘Purpose’ question** 

\- This question requires students to show the purpose of something. It could be the purpose of the poster website etc, purpose of a certain persuasive technique.

Students should answer this question with 

1. “It is to…”
2. “The purpose is to…”

&#x200B;

**‘Intended effect’ question**

\- This question requires students to show the effect the author of the material wishes to see in the audience upon reading the material

&#x200B;

Students should answer this question with

1. “The reader/audience will… (feel something/think of something, which may then lead to an action)

&#x200B;

**‘Message’ question** 

This question requires students to state what the message of the visual is. Students must show what kind of idea the author is trying to put into the minds of the audience.

&#x200B;

Students should answer this question with 

1. “The message is…” or “It s telling the reader/audience that…”

&#x200B;

**What does this image tell you question**

Link back to Image + what the question wants you to prove

&#x200B;

**Repetition - to emphasize … and creates a sense of urgency**

**Pronouns - involves the reader and make the reader feel included**

&#x200B;

Section B: Narrative Comprehension

**Language use: state SYNONYMS of the keyward/implicit meaning of the detail**

E.g. If the question is asking about the details that makes the author seem afraid of the place, your details MUST be directly related to the idea of 'fear'.

""xxxxx"" suggests that the author's body was trembling as he was scared.

&#x200B;

**Style of language: Use of triplets, inverted commas, only a sentence in the last paragraph, present tense, alliteration, em dash, use of long sentence followed by a short.**

Most of the time, it is to put an emphasis/allow information to be easily grasped by the reader/make it more memorable or attention grabbing. However, please take note this list is NOT exhaustive and a cookie cutter answer. Do analyse the comprehension setting before answer!

&#x200B;

**Impact of the language: Effective vs Unusual**

Effective : Explain the expression in relation to the situation in the passage

Unusual : How is this express unusual? Explain that this usually refers ""...."" but in this case, it is used to....

E.g. Why is the phrase ""daylight nightmare"" unusual and effective?

It is unusual because nightmares usually happen at night and not during the day. it is effective to show how terrifying the experience was.

&#x200B;

Apt/Suitable: Why is it apt to use A to refer to B? Find the SIMILARITY between the 2 and explain accordingly to the CONTEXT.

&#x200B;

**Excess Denied: For the love of God, this is one of the most easiest and far most regretable way to lose your marks. READ READ READ the question carefully. If the question wants you to talk about Ramen, don't go and write about Ramen AND Instant noodles. That's how you can say bye to your marks muacks**

&#x200B;

**Revise what is taught in the comprehension unit:**

Mood!

Atmosphere!

Attitude!

Tone!

&#x200B;

>**Tone:**  
>  
>Sarcastic Despair Dispirited Disappointed Humorous Friendly Bitter Matter-of-fact  
>  
>**Attitude:**  
>  
>Appreciative Pessimistic Optimistic Cynical Rude Bitter Determined  
>  
>**Mood:** Cheerful Melancholy Tense Light-hearted Excitement Mysterious

\^ This list only gives a general idea!

Go and memorise at least 2-3 of each with different meanings! 'The author was feeling sacarstic' 'The author spoke with a tone of sarcasm' won't get you far if Cambridge decides to stump you with another meaning !!!!!!

&#x200B;

Summary has 2 criteria for you to hit, total of 15 marks

1. Points
2. Language

&#x200B;

Make sure you understand what the question is hinting at. When finding points, ask yourself, does this ANSWER my question?  If no, would advise you to skip it/come back to it if you have insufficient points

Don’t include examples as well as they are excessive.

If the passage says something like “adversity”, you must remember to write SERIOUS difficulties to let the marker know to what extent is this difficulty is.

If changing the words are not your forte, make sure to aim for the point marks.  By this, you can hit at least a 8-10 to secure your A’s! The rest of the marks come from your competency in answering it :)

&#x200B;

I’m not sure if it’s apt to say summary can be improved, each passage is different and so does your mindset/questions when doing it. You can refer to the above to guide you through summary and hopefully allows you to clinch those marks \~

&#x200B;

**THESE INFORMATION CAN HELP YOU TO COMPLETE THE PAPER WITH MORE EASE RATHER THAN GOING INTO THE hall without knowing what to expected hhaha**

A common trend I've realised through all the papers, was that Language used (always tested) and what was the author's (tone/mood/attitude towards something) questions were very repetitive!

Memorise those maxims/quotes/sayings online too babes\~\~\~ Here's some of my favs:

The grass is always greener on the other side (envying someone for something you don’t have)

\- No man is an island (everyone relies on others)

\- Shakespeare “To thine own self be true” (finding your true own authentic self in the areas of emotional and physical well-being)

\- The world is (our/my) oyster (there are many opportunities in the world)

\- Beauty is in the eyes of the beholder (beauty is subjective to everyone)

\- There is no situation that cannot be made worse (Bad situations arise when we are panicking)

30,[O levels] Psyduck used Confusion. It is super effective!,"listen here seab ~~you lil shit~~

before i start, i'm glad that you didn't change the paper timings although several CLTs were cancelled. besides the unwanted higher weightage on the other topics and excessive time given to double check questions that we know we can never answer correctly, i'm still grateful for the mercy you have shown us. even after the brutal amath paper 2 this week, i still could grit my teeth. 

but today's pure biology paper was the last straw. out of the 20 topics tested, only 6 were tested. not only were there 6, but those 6 were the 6 topics that many people are unfamiliar with. where are my beloved plant and nervous system questions?? and what is with all the questions about definitions?? i can assure you that majority of the student population don't know how to answer them properly. and when you test more familiar topics like transport in humans, i thought i could escape the horror this paper already was - yet the question on arteries was foreign too. 

many people left the halls with expressions similar to the shocked pikachu face or with enough tears streaking down their grieving faces to douse a forest fire so non-fire resistant eucalyptus trees can still survive. 

all in all, it was one of the (if not the most) strangest papers i have ever done. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jjfuhr/o_levels_psyduck_used_confusion_it_is_super/,True,2020-10-28 18:46:13
31,[Rant] hbl was better imo,"this is gonna sound hella privileged but i jus needed somewhere to express my opinion.
i’m in jc2 and i personally really enjoyed hbl. it feels like the majority of my friends all want to go back to school but i secretly just want this learning arrangement to continue.

- im lucky enough to have a quiet place to study from home, and the lack of surrounding distractions and noise really helped me concentrate better and actually absorb something from the lessons

- no need for interaction with classmates. my classmates are great but a) ive tried super hard for a long time to connect with them on deeper levels but i really don’t vibe and b) the lack of their visual presence completely eliminates my anxiety and i feel way more calm when asked to speak up in class or have discussions.

- we’re at home. there’s no obligation to look good or be presentable every single day of the week. hbl really helped me chill a bit with my obsession with my appearance. and on days when i’m feeling particularly insecure im not obligated to see anyone.

- im also lucky enough to be able to spend time with people who matter a lot to me even during hbl- my family is right here, my friends are a zoom call away and when i’m not in the mood for social stuff i can ignore people i don’t want to talk to without being seen as a bitch or unfriendly.

- teachers are contactable through email and video calls for consults and some lectures are prerecorded and thus convenient. i can slow it down or speed it up for my learning pace. i personally don’t really feel that hbl is as bad of a learning medium as everyone says.

- the only downside is the lack of f2f interaction with my friends. i did miss that but if the situation had allowed for us to hang out outside of school and if my wifi didn’t suck i would be completely content with attending class online exclusively.

i don’t mind things going back to normal, especially since way more people seem to benefit from being in school physically (eg. different home conditions, tech barriers etc.) though for me i learnt more in a month of hbl than i did in a month of real life classes.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gvywt3/rant_hbl_was_better_imo/,True,2020-06-04 10:01:16
32,[A levels] Personal statistic of private candidate during NS (26.25 to 90RP),"In 2017, I took the a levels and got 26.25RP, UUE/U with a D in GP. Retook it last year during NS and got 90RP today.  I'm writing this because when I was retaking I couldn't find many examples of people who had made massive improvements after retaking in NS, and those whom I could find didn't give much specific details of their processes.

Using a pomodoro app, I documented the amount of time I spent studying by subject.

Math: 377 hours

Chemistry: 488 hours

Physics: 375 hours

Economics: 112 hours

GP: 12 hours

I started studying from december 2018 to november 2019, spending an average of 3.782 hours per day. From december to february, I did light studying to get back into the rhythm of studying for a levels. From March to August, I did intense studying and most of the productive work was done during this period. From September to October, I hit a plateau and never made any significant improvements from then on. During the A level period in November, I did light revision (reading the notes) just to ensure my memories and abilities are fresh.

Since I only started studying one year after my first attempt and I didn't even know much in the first place, I can estimate my initial knowledge to be zero. I hit a plateau in September and never improved beyond that so I would deduct the hours spent in September and October which is 223 hours. So by that logic, I took 1139 hours to get from approximately zero knowledge to 90RP standard.

If you have Cs and Ds, you are at a better starting point than me and would take less time. If you are smarter/dumber than me, you would take less/more time. So, yeah it's possible to get 90RP retaking as a private candidate in the army as long as you get a slack vocation and you mug a lot.

33,[O Levels] Predicting the possible questions for upcoming O Level papers,"[Shitpost warning]


Hi r/sgexams, I’ve done my research and it seems like SEAB are intent on setting questions related to the gluteus maximus. For those who don’t know, E-Math had {a-r-s-e} as the correct answer and English Paper 2 had a passage which revolved around the jackass penguin. How subtle. Considering the fact that there are way more topics than just butts, it is evident that some wanker at SEAB is having a laugh.

Enough talk. There will only be 1 bottom-related question for each subject. Thank me for your free marks later on.

A-Math: James has a thicc ass. The gradient of the side of his butt is 7x-9. Given that the centre of his butt passes through the point (6, 9), find the equation of James’s butt.

34,[O LEVELS] scoring 15 points but went to ITE,"hello, this is a very sad case but i scored 15 for Os and went to ITE. The whole world was against my idea of enrolling into ITE after Os but i didn't had a choice back then. I failed my Math F9, Eng D7 despite getting L1B4 15. I only got 7 choices on my report slip and all of them were choices into ITE. I was devastated upon receiving my results on 13 Jan 2020 just because of that 1 or 2 subject. I got A1 for English in Literature (pure lit), A2 for combined humanities (geo/ss) but idk how i still failed my english. Yes i know it is super ironic because all my teachers were shocked, friends were stunned, and even O lvl private candidate invigilators for O lvl Oral exam 2020 (yesterday) asked me why i decided to waste my time in ITE when i could have just retook O lvls without stressing on both ITE and O lvls. My DAE application was rejected, so as EAE this year—what a luck hahaha sobs.... I did apply for retaking Os this year and am already in preparation. To be honest, i couldn't stand preparing 1 year just for O lvls it might drive me into su¡c!dal thoughts as I'm already very depressed. So i chose the harder way by managing both in learning ITE course(and scoring above average) as well as trying my best for O lvls. This year has been super hectic for me. Im taking a leap of faith and hope that i will do well and decide which path i will continue next year. Perhaps JC bc i can mug haha. ITE isn't as bad as people describe. I am making lots of friends in higher nitec and i notice they study harder than some of the people I've seen in year 1 poly. It's time to change your mentality everyone. Throw that stigma away. Stop marginalising people from different educational paths. Even flowers bloom in hell sometimes. Lastly, I would like to hear from the ground. Any opinions about my case?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ial45e/o_levels_scoring_15_points_but_went_to_ite/,True,2020-08-16 19:04:41
35,[JC] Regarding Exams...,"SecSchool/JC was quite a while back for me, but I do have some bad experiences that I learned from, which I think could be helpful to share.

# ONE

I was dating this girl and she was pretty bad at physics. My physics was actually pretty good. I'd consistently get A1/A2 but she struggles with D/E. It was the day before the Physics paper and I spent the night coaching her over the phone about how to answer some questions, and about various topics. No sweet-talk, legit.

Was doing that up till about 4/5am.

Barely got any sleep as we had to get up in 1-2 hours time to head to school and do the paper.

Time seemed to slow down/speed up, I couldn't tell. Essentially, I could barely focus, and when the invigilator announced that there was 5 mins left, I was 3-4 pages away from the end of the paper.

In the end, I scored an E.

Lesson learnt:

~~Hoes drag you down.~~

>REST IS IMPORTANT. Keeping peace of mind and getting enough rest is CRUCIAL if you want to do well.

# TWO

I was a mediocre IP student, which meant that A levels would be my only national exam on record. No O levels to fall back on. One thing I was fortunate to do was to put in consistent effort in Y1/Y2. Instead of being too focused on 'adjusting to JC', I was just paying attention and doing the requisite assignments. Each exam/test was a measuring stick for my ability to grasp the nature of each subject and what examiners were looking for in answers.

Like every other student, I planned to cram and chiong for the final weeks before A-levels.

**LO AND BEHOLD** my fking parents decided that a holiday to China right before my A-levels was a good idea.

I brought my notes and tried to study whenever there was time, but there were barely conducive opportunities to study. I came back the day before my A-levels.

In the end, I did well for GP, Physics, Math, and Econs. The ones that I put consistent effort in and saw gradual improvements.

The one subject I did NOT do well in, was H2 Art. Which comparatively speaking, required THE MOST consistent work. That was the subject that I crammed for, and crammed for coursework too.

>Consistency ALWAYS trumps last minute work. 1 hour a day, each day beats 24 hours for a month, anytime.

# THREE

Actually this one is not about exams, its about what's next. I was considering being a game designer, or maybe starting a business. So I applied for NUS Business School, and thought that maybe I could take a minor or something in Comms and New Media (which had game design modules).

WTF.

After spending a year in Business School, where it was a mugger-fest of people spending over 20hours preparing and rehearsing intensely for a presentation that contributed 5% of the grades for the module, where me **getting a 28/30 for a paper earned me a C** because the average student got 29/30... I learnt first-hand that Business School was NOTHING about starting a business. It was all about grinding into you an extremely dog-eat-dog, competitive spirit. With a side/pinch of content about finance, marketing, accounting etc. that was somewhat useful to learn.

In the end, I dropped the Business course, and switched into FASS to go fully into Comms & New Media. Enjoyed myself so much more. Actually went on to do some level of game design, software design, and start a business. Because I had the time and space to do these things, instead of mugging like mad just for the grades.

>The biggest value in university is NOT the the curriculum or the content. It is the environment and community that you find yourself in. Make the most of your freedom. Don't use grade-pressure (the lousiest lamest part of university) as a reason to avoid taking initiative to explore and learn what you want by doing random projects with peers (the best part of university).

&#x200B;

Ok commercial break over. Boomer out.

&#x200B;

Edit: While this is getting some attention, I'd like to highlight that I've been hanging around this sub-reddit for awhile because every now and then, students will be stressed about school, what choice they want to make for further education etc. and honestly, there's a lot of resources I'm building up to support those needs. That's also why I have a flair above called 'Praxium' which is the initiative I'm running to support this effort.

36,[Rant] Systemic Discrimination And Inequalities In The Education System,"I have always been a silent user on this forum, but browsing through many of the commentaries here have made me realize there are certain topics that most of us, the silent majority, are united in opposing⸺based on fundamental notions of what is right, what is fair, and what this country has become.

The general sentiment I’ve been receiving is that the system is becoming more and more unfair. That the rules of the game are increasingly bent and distorted in the favor of a small minority, that no matter how hard you try, it doesn’t matter. I am here to tell you that you are right. To tell you that you are not alone in thinking these thoughts, and that you most certainly are NOT bitter or jealous or lazy for blaming your inability to succeed on the system, regardless of what those at the top may tell you. There are real, genuine grievances we legitimately share against this system, and we should not let them suppress our voices anymore. Just because we have always been invisible and silent doesn’t mean we always have to be; just because we have grown used to being ignored, rejected and discarded without a second thought doesn’t mean we should continue accepting it!

And why all this matters, why this should concern us, is that within Singapore at least, the education system is really the only legitimate means for us to be able to get a decent job in the future and not have to spend the rest of our lives drowning in debt and working skin to bone like they do in other countries. For those who would say that every school is a good school, that every job is a good job, come on! Look at all the broad based labor market trends, the increasing digitalisation and financialization of our economy, and it becomes quite evident that if you don’t have a decent education with ‘good’ grades in this country, you’re SCREWED⸺as those who have already succeeded up there like to tell us. This system has become tailored towards the agenda of the rich and powerful, and I’m going to tell you why I think so.

**The Financialization of The Education System**

It’s no secret that education has become increasingly less about personal ability but economic power. Those with wealth and privilege choose to weaponize it in our ‘meritocracy’ struggle. The tuition industry, especially the elite, one-on-one tutors that the average household can’t afford, is ballooning. One of the conversations I’ll perpetually remember is when a former friend told me quite arrogantly that the amount of money he was spending on his elite tuition services every month was equivalent to the wage of a F&B or construction worker.  Money is being used to erect barriers to entry in the education system, especially for those at the bottom.

But you know what’s even worse? Granted, in a country that has enthusiastically embraced neoliberal capitalist ideals, money does what money wants. As a top-performing student myself (no tuition), I can tell you that what’s even more egregious, what’s even more appalling and sickening, are all the non-academic barriers to entry being erected which are **specifically accessible only through economic power.** Arguably, you can still score well in your studies even without abusing the power of your family’s credit card (something that’s debatable, and which I don’t fully agree with). But some battles are lost at the very beginning just because you don’t have the prerequisite finances.

Millions are spent in the ‘holistic’ arena as students try to prove that they are more cultured, refined and empathetic than their peers. It’s really ironic how the government’s move to rely less on grades, but on other ‘intangible’ characteristics was meant to improve equity, but accomplished the complete and utter reverse. These strategic moves are even [less accessible to those at the bottom, and play out in scholarship and higher education selections too.](https://spj.hkspublications.org/2020/09/13/rethinking-scholarship-diversity-the-pre-u-education-of-psc-scholars/) I personally know of a friend who published a book (like the medical books for children you see in the clinic) and had his father buy thousands of copies to assist him in getting into medical school. I am also aware of many fundraising events where the largest donors for  who and who’s ‘charitable’ causes are their parents (and by an extremely substantial margin too). Coming from one of Singapore’s ‘elite’ schools, I am sadly all too accustomed to the desperate means that students resort to so as to enter the Ivy Leagues or law/medical school or to secure prestigious scholarships when they lack genuine ability but happen to have spare cash. To a lesser extent, a few also spend tens of thousands on competitive sports, though it’s nothing like the [situation in the US](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2020/11/squash-lacrosse-niche-sports-ivy-league-admissions/616474/), I must gratefully admit. Now, it must be noted that the examples mentioned above are all empirical observations that may not reflect the true reality of Singapore, but I have a feeling that you will all nonetheless still be quite familiar with them ;)

**Formation of Exclusionary Networks**

Additionally, I am sure that many will agree with me that our society is becoming increasingly [polarised](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/meritocracy-in-singapore-solution-or-problem). Economists describe this situation (when taken to its utter extremes) as a 'dualistic economy', which is a situation when there is a completely different set of economic and societal systems and networks for the rich and the poor. That's one of the key reasons why there has been [increasing talk by the government](https://www.pmo.gov.sg/Newsroom/pm-lee-hsien-loong-debate-presidents-speech-2018) about the need to reverse this trend, something I genuinely hope they are successful in achieving.

But generally, it can be conceded that there is an increasing disjunction between the lives and networks of the rich and the poor, and this in turn creates a divergence of opportunities, incentives and outcomes. So what do I mean? Generally speaking, when we talk about inequality in terms of opportunities, it is highly inadequate to talk merely about the financial side of things, but we must also examine the phenomenon of social capital.

Social capital is indisputably just as potent as actual capital, and it can be easily observed through some quick empirical observations. First of all, [the upper class have inherent hereditary advantages when it comes to forming connections between themselves.](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/ips/study-of-social-capital-in-singapore.pdf) Think about alumni networks, country clubs, business connections, etc. The most common example you will be familiar with would be the access to overseas VIAs or internships at the top firms through one’s highly placed parents. But is this the extent of it all? No, it is not. In fact, it barely begins to cover or do justice to the role of social capital in determining outcomes and success.

Social capital and the ability to gain connections and control over social networks quickly enable one to be able to leverage on them for greater power and influence. Our modern life is one where influence and cultural positions dominate. Connections are key to acquiring scholarships, higher education opportunities, as well as workplace promotions and opportunities. And not just any connections, but predominantly those which are well-placed, be it peers from equally affluent families or high-ranking teachers or individuals in the corporate and public spheres.

Game-theoretic models show how collective action can be decisively taken by a small minority to advance their interests ahead of a large majority, the technicalities of which I will not go into. Effectively speaking, this implies that many leadership positions or other prominent roles can be effectively dominated by the upper echelons, benchmarks which are highly critical for university admissions and scholarships. [The earlier article above](https://spj.hkspublications.org/2020/09/13/rethinking-scholarship-diversity-the-pre-u-education-of-psc-scholars/) seems to confirm this empirically, as it can be observed that these very attributes that are prioritized in the allocation of public scholarships as well as government roles tend to be concentrated disproportionately within the upper ranks of the affluent. Of course, there will be exceptions, but from a broad statistical point of view, that seems to be the norm.

Are you aware your entire future, all the gateways available to you after the education system, could be either created or destroyed by the so-called gatekeepers of that system, namely the principle and others from the leadership track in MOE? Think about the many events such as ‘gala dinners’ or other exclusionary events restricted to the privileged few in school. These serve as screening devices which filter the rest of us out. Frankly speaking, unless you’re a child prodigy, your level of academic success won’t really serve to differentiate you in your post-JC pursuits (due to the aforementioned financialization of the education system where rich kids generally dominate the game).  It is not enough to be a ‘good’ kid, anymore. It is not even enough to be well-liked by your teachers (unless they’re very high-up) and your peers. Instead, the test of your character as well as the other hallmarks of cachet (i.e. valedictorian, etc) are determined by a few individuals at the very top, namely the principle and those in the higher-education committees, whose attention you really have to vie for.

Unless these people stamp the seal of approval on you, you may as well give up your dream of anything too ‘ambitious’. Scholarships, good universities, all heavily rely on these metrics. In case you believe this is all mere conjecture, these are all realities that I have been told by my teachers, and it really isn’t too hard to believe. Rhetorically, just think about the sort of people who achieve success in JC. Furthermore, think about the way the school budget is structured, and think about which group of students are the greatest beneficiaries. And ask yourself, are you fine with that? Is that in any way fair? Is this what it means to live in a supposedly meritocratic society?

**Cognitive Capture**

Finally, let me point out how our institutions are structured in a manner which blames those who cannot succeed while creating incentives for those at the top. [Channel NewsAsia’s survey](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/poverty-tends-trap-people-poor-decisions-singapore-class-divide-10965206) reveals that the majority of Singaporeans interviewed believed that the poor are poor because they are simply lazy. That is, of course, a disgusting and vile lie that has no basis in reality. And let me tell you why the people at the top want you to believe this lie. By believing that the poor are impoverished due to their own fault, the rich not only evade moral responsibility for your crises, but also have the poor and the middle class buy into that lie. It allows us to ignore their abuses of financial power and influence, it allows us to think that our oppression is justified, and stemming from our own faults. In short, they want to keep you ignorant to continue exploiting you.

There has been a growing openness about the need to discuss these issues, yet there is still quite a fair bit of backlash towards anyone who doesn’t worship the holy grail of meritocracy. This is manifest within our institutions as well as the sphere of public discourse, where the narrative is tightly controlled, where YOU are cast out to be a failure if you do not do well in your exams, and that those at the top who spend hundreds of thousands on securing their success are cast as deserving of their success. Cognitive capture of the public into this myth, this myth of meritocracy, is what prevents us from tackling the above issues mentioned. As long as we continue to believe that our plight is because we are lazy, because we are hopeless, because we are somewhat *lesser* than them, the more and more ordeals we have to suffer. A change in mindset is going to be necessary to bring about a  change in the ways our systems are designed.

**Concluding Notes**

Did I finish saying even half of what there is to be said? Of course not, and in reality, there are many more issues to be flagged out and condemned, which I hope to do so in the future (provided there is sufficient demand for it). All around the world, economic nationalism is growing, and one of the reasons why President Trump was able to reshape the Republican Party in his image was the tide of anger and fury he rode on from the masses of disenfranchised workers. At the end of the day, here is what I want to say. Are those who succeeded necessarily more deserving than you? Did they even work harder, or have higher abilities? If they truly did, I would keep my mouth closed and just accept the situation. But I don’t think so, and I say so as someone who is most certainly guilty of several of the abuses highlighted above. This system has benefitted me, and has placed me in a position of relative entitlement and privilege compared to the average Singaporean.

So why am I condemning it? I personally come from a lower-income family, as well as having faced a slew of other struggles, and the way that I’ve managed to succeed from the system has been through shameless ingratiation and bootlicking of those richer and more powerful than me. One thing the system has definitely taught me was to become a much more Machiavellian human being, as well as to erode away my sense of morality. Education has become a war, a war without guns and bombs, but a war nonetheless. Yet, some personal impulse of me suddenly motivated me to write this, some abstract sense of righteousness and disgust perhaps. So I’ll leave you with one final question: are you fine with this? Unfairness only prevails as long as we are willing to accept it, and I am sure that there are enough of us to create change.

38,[JC] I have a crush on a teacher.,"I might get downvoted to hell regardless of what I say, but I’d like to start this off by saying I have no intention of ever acting on it and I’ll never put my teacher in a morally-compromising situation. 

Anyway, I know such confessions are different from the usual crushes, because well... it’s admittedly weird. (Plus the age gap - it’s abt 10 years) 

It started when I was in an admittedly vulnerable place in the beginning of J2. Long story short, we had some conversations here and there and I began to like him. People will ask why and I’m like... ‘he listens’? Lol I know that’s a stupid way of explaining things but I feel like I connect to him more than I should. 

I’ve done a lot of reflection on my part. (Really trying to not be blinded by emotions here, lol) I don’t know if this crush is coming from a place of neediness - because he’s given me the care/concern I felt was lacking in my life. Or if it’s escapism - to deal with the stressors of J2 and As. 

I don’t know if I’m looking for advice. I just want to reiterate that I’m not gonna act on any of this but I just wanted to get it out there. 

I mean objectively I know I'll get over it some day but it just feels different right at this moment.

Is this my melodramatic teenage love story? I’m so tired of it. Lmfao.

Edit: Is this considered ‘blowing up’? Or are all of these sympathy upvotes lmao. Anyway, thank you for the comments. I enjoyed reading what you’ve shared. It’s nice to know I’m not alone... but maybe chill on the upvotes.

40,[Rant] Why are people actually still looking down on people who are working in Macdonalds and where is the honesty in people?,"TL;dr 
Can someone please enlighten me why do people actually still look down on MacDonalds? Why are people still not being honest? 



 It was my 2nd job and my first was actually my family shop. I'm currently still working at MacDonalds and when I was serving some of the customers,I overheard alot of parents were telling their kids ""Study hard and don't be like them no education and end up working at MacDonalds"". I wanted to straight up shout at them but I can't.I wanted to say if you don't know about one's background don't judge them. I'm still working while studying because the economy is killing my family business and I have to support my family too. And what is the reason why I chose Macdonalds it's because I really enjoy the benefits they provide me. They provide employee discounts for ALL food when you spend abv $5 and it is 10%. They also provides  free certificates such as (food hygiene cert and diploma in hospitality cert(provided you reach 5 years and abv). We even get like medical benefits free medical check up etc. 

// Anyways go to the next part thanks

I know it's shaker fries season....and everyone is greedy asf for the seaweed seasoning. 
I was packing the items (especially the condiments such as curry,chilli and etc) to be included for  the customer's  take away. I put everything inside including the shaker seasoning...and later after around 5mins the SAME customer come back and say that I never gave seaweed seasoning? WHAT EVEN? I GAVE AND THE CUSTOMER SAID I NEVER? Bro don't make me lose my position of making my way to be an assistant floor manager. My boss gave me a disappointed face you know? I told my boss to check the cctv and that ACTUALLY SAVE MYSELF FROM losing my way to be an assistant floor manager.  SO PLEASE HAVE GOD DAMN HONESTY.

41,[A Levels] Modern Day Competition,"just some thoughts after years in an IP school. some context : i was in tripsci in y3-4, and somehow landed myself in one of the top few classes. y5-6, 4H2 PCME, and found myself in a class which often made it to the top in physics, chem and math.

and somehow, i got thrown to the very deep end of ""mugger culture"" and made very interesting discoveries. 

""I NV STUDY""
competition nowadays isn't ""bro i studied 12hrs yesterday wbu?"" but ""damn i NV study. i'm GONNA FAIL"" and post on insta abt how bad the paper was. we all know (too well) what results that bastard gets. and then comes the reverberating ""SAME"" from like 3/4 other people. 

it kind of pisses me off sometimes especially since i wasn't doing very well (rp 30+) at the start of this year even though i rly tried so hard while they all score so well. i was juggling a ton of events (literally had 2 performances & 1 external VIA) and a truckload of stuff at the start of J2. it seems like nowadays, ""admired"" are those who don't study while people who study hard are looked down on. little credit is given for effort while not giving a damn about your studies is seen as desirable. the kind of encouragement & teamwork for studies in my parents' days don't seem to exist. this sort of environment created by us is inherently toxic. and insanely painful for those finding themselves on the left side of the bell curve.  

""MUGGER la"" 
ain't this phrase commonplace as heck. calling people muggers for putting in their best. what's the intention of this? perhaps, an attempt to bring others down. perhaps, pushing others down to make yourself feel better for the 4 less papers you did. those who actually put in effort are not just FROWNED upon but they are actively shunned. society has evolved and attacks don't go like ""ew this guy is disgusting "" but go indirectly like ""this guy is a mugger"". society has evolved until our perception of studying has become something negative & undesirable. but again, those who label others as muggers just go home and study their ass off, and bc they know they've studied, they don't study in school. that's competition right there. 

slowly i learnt to adapt to such a culture. was tough in y3-5 but got better in JC2. in feb or so i looked at my 38rp result slip and just wanted to kms & called myself dumb and everyth. it's at that point in time i decided i needed to do SOMETHING cus this wasn't gg to work out. at the same time i made a decision to work towards getting into medicine in university, a course i always wanted but never thought i could reach it bc my grades were too trash. i don't believe that i was that dumb. so from then on i decided to work hard. ran into every single attack possible. ""why u study so hard"" ""don't mug alr leh"" ""go home then study la play game first"". chose to ignore all those and told them ""my grades too bad alr man i need study"" and continued. studied my ass of during CB, and took most of my recess times to do extra papers when we got back to school. it was legit tough to do so bc everyone would question why i worked so hard. i just said ""now alevel u don't mug u do what?"" and i knew deep down i only had one goal which i didn't tell many about cus it felt embarrassing to aim for smt like that. cus of that my grades saw a little improvement. jumped to 69 in myes, and managed to add another 12 in prelims. point of saying this is that it worked to ignore the comments. to all those drowning in society's pressures, try to ignore it. ditch the competition and toxicity and compare w yourself. ultimately you're making yourself happy. not the rest. if you really want smt, go for it and don't stop at anything cus we'll see who gets the last laugh! if no one does, let me admire you for your effort, and tell u that having perseverance is a quality in its own. no matter what your results are, be glad you did ur best. no regrets, keep ur head up son. 

such environments only make academics a lonely fight. it is no wonder many get anxiety attacks, cry in the middle of school and take anti-depressants to get by. bc school is tough, and a competitive environment just makes it worse. together with expectations from typical asian parents, it's a recipe for a mental (and physical) health disaster. count yourself lucky if you're doing well, but do have some empathy for those trying their best. 

till then, to all d haters i nv gave an answer to, i mugged bc bitch, i'm gonna make my dreams come true. 

the day when the sky rains, the day when the muscles ache, is the day when champions train. just 2.5 weeks left to the end of As. all the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jqoxr1/a_levels_modern_day_competition/,True,2020-11-09 18:18:33
42,"[A Levels] Pursue your desires and never look back, ever.","In this highly and overly pragmatic society we all live in, most of you probably had a dream or a desire but were crushed due to circumstance, whether it be due to parents or Teachers or society. 

However, I believe that despite all odds in this conservative society who enjoys stability to a fault, there is always a way to pursue your passions that you so desire even if the circumstances look bleak.

But who am I to say this right? It’s as if I have actually successfully pursued my dreams.

I am Furball, owner of the YouTube channel FurballTheHammy who mainly makes Hypixel Skyblock Videos in Minecraft. And I hope that my journey will inspire others to follow their dreams despite circumstances and challenges, that anything is possible with enough will, hatred and resilience.

I started out in December 2019. It was at the end of J1, and I decided to start a YouTube channel just for the fun of it, because I am a highly dedicated player in the Hypixel Skyblock network, being ranked on the leaderboards and I wanted to make guides and videos to help out the community and more. 

Back then, I had 0 editing knowledge, 0 scriptwriting skills and merely had a MacBook Air to record videos at a bad 10-20 FPS quality. Which made my videos laggy and bad aesthetically. 

I still remember how the first video sparked joy in me, when I realised how my videos was able to reach a couple people, even if it was just 10 or 20. Just imagining 20 people watching my work and appreciating it, felt surreal to me. And for someone who is a highly introverted, overly shy person who is passive to a fault and never ever engages in a conversation unless approached. It felt rejuvenating, that I was able to get my words across to the world, even if it was just a mere few. The power of being able to communicate my values and words without having to deal with my personal issues of self image and confidence called to me. And with that first video published, it set the journey to the channel where I am at today.

I still remember how my parents challenged my decision to take YouTube more seriously and to actually spend time making videos which took hours to produce, script and record. Knowing how this was my A levels year, even my Teachers were worried and questioned my decisions, not all, but a couple did. Despite knowing all the circumstances were against me, with A levels, my lack of experience and my lack of hardware to produce good quality videos, I kept pushing on, making video after video, refining my production skills and experience with each video. Of course, there was plenty of conflict, plenty of sacrifices I’ve made and plenty of tears that were shed. I still remember making the final decision to stick to my guns and fought with my parents as though as my life was on the line, and argued with a couple Teachers. 

I knew that I could manage my studies and my channel and still maintain my prestige in game position, but of course, there was still doubt within me. I was never a spectacular student, I was always borderline average or below average, but never at the risk of retaining. And of course, my parents and Teachers were worried assuming how my grades without additional commitments were lacklustre and with this new commitment, it could be made worse. 

But even then, I still fought for the freedom to maintain my channel, I fought hard, breaking family ties and shattering them just for the existence of my channel. Everyday felt like an internal war with one side burning with passion and the other feeling bad for my actions. 

But I still stuck to my guns and eventually, the storm ended and my grades went up. Despite the additional commitments and that was around mid years, and my parents and Teachers cut me some slack to maintain my channel as usual, but little did I know that this isn’t the last time I would confront this problem.

At this point in time, my channel grew and was monetised, I was able to make a chunk of change from it and saved to buy myself a PC build to improve my video quality. I still remember the good old days when I still managed to clear 10,000 subscribers despite the sad aesthetic quality videos I made. 

This was when my channel started to grow a lot more especially with CCA being cancelled due to Covid, and yes, I hate CCA’s to a fault because it is trash especially if you have a hobby that lies outside of the definition MOE sets out for you, even if it can be more holistic and valuable, but that’s an argument for another day.

Eventually the A levels & prelims rolled around and I was still making videos as usual and my parents & Teachers started to get more worried again. 

This just kept going on and on, it was basically arguments after arguments on convincing people how I could manage all of my commitments. And at the end of the day, I cleared the prelims with 70+ RP, which certainly wasn’t amazing, but it was definitely a decent score considering the daily battles I had to fight and how I had to spend 30 hours a week grinding to maintain my in game position and record and edit videos as usual. Along with the fact that I didn’t have a single tuition and probably did less than 3 consults in my entire JC career. 

But of course, there were sacrifices, such as my JC breaks being fully utilised for studying and having to rush home to make more videos and clock in the hours I need to grind. My weekends were all packed full and I had to study and manage my YT stuff. 

And at the end of the day, after a full year, we have broke the 30,000 subscriber mark and am eligible to become an official YouTuber on the Hypixel network, the largest server in Minecraft, acquired 2M+ views and even got a couple sponsorship deals and to make sizeable amount of money as a whole. 

And above that I even managed to break a World Record in the game after my A levels. 

It was a dastardly hard challenge to constantly stand my ground despite the seed of worry that tells me “what if it fails?” But I certainly must say, the most transformative years in my entire life rested upon this year. It tested my resilience, will and my motivation to turn hatred and belittlement into fuel and energy to push harder than ever. 

30,000 subscribers isn’t a huge success by any means, but considering the bleak circumstances, context and skills I had, I have to acknowledge that it was certainly pretty surprising. And it was entirely, a 1 man show. 

But what I do hope this story tells you is that, anything is possible, if you have the will and desperation to succeed. Whatever you motivation lies in, utilise it, anything can be a pushing force. I turned doubt and belittlement into fuel to drive myself harder.

Singapore is a horrible place to pursue your dreams especially if they lie far off the regular track, but it is still possible if you’re willing to fight for it, as though as your life depended on it.

I only have 1 life to live, and I want to make it count, by assimilating myself into society, I am doing myself a disservice to my limited time I have. I don’t want to live the “Singaporean dream”. I want to live my dream and my dream alone. 

I hope this inspires anyone out there who has a budding spark in them to set it ablaze and to fuel hope. Because it is certainly possible, it will be painful and riddled with tears, sweat and pain, but it will be worthwhile. 

I am the master of my fate

I am the captain of my soul 

-Invictus

Even if the circumstances seems dire, never succumb to fate or let go of your passions, you are the master of your fate and you have the power to turn it around. Never give up, and don’t look back, pursue your dreams like it’s your life.

43,[RANT] hidden toxicity of this subreddit,"Hello first of all this is not a complete rant because I would like to start off by thanking the subreddit for the positivity it offered to those seeking comfort, and the wonderful sharing of resources offered by the community. 

However, I just thought that we should address the hidden toxicity towards those who ""did well"" in the eyes of others but not by their own standards. I just saw a comment where it went something like ""i didn't know if this was a good score but judging by the downvotes it is"". 

Yes I agree that some may find such comments about others doing well being offensive, but there is a line drawn between those who actually need a community to support them, and those who were being outright obnoxious (and trust me I downvote those as well). 

During this A levels period I hardly got any good sleep, and I have been having breakouts and breakdowns where I legit just started crying when I was doing a paper. And to me not getting full marks for an MCQ paper is something that I feel sad about, not because I am insensitive, but because I was given so much stress to perform, both from others and myself. My point is everyone has a right to be sad for not doing well, and don't be immature and not know when to draw the line and be salty to everyone who express slight sadness when they, in YOUR opinion, do not deserve to do so. Let's try to make this community a more inclusive one, shall we? 

note: constructive comments welcomed, those who just want to be salty, please go and find something better to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k01shl/rant_hidden_toxicity_of_this_subreddit/,True,2020-11-25 01:19:46
44,[A Levels] I can’t do this,"How do I start this? 

I hate studying. Full stop. By some miracle, I managed to get through my O levels with sudden motivation that came from I don’t know where. I didn’t even do that great. L1R5 was like 12 after deducting 2 points. 

I didn’t know what I was going to do when I got my results. JC seemed terrible, but I had no idea what I was going to do in Poly, so I just went with what my family was saying and enrolled in a JC (I’d rather not disclose the name).

I hated it. From the first day until now, all I’ve done is contemplated why I made such a choice and why I’m in the science stream when science and math aren’t my strong suits. It shows in my grades (mostly Us in the latest CAs) 

Promos (written papers) are in five? six? weeks, and I genuinely believe that I am going to screw those up too. I can’t afford to mess up promos because I’ve just been doing terribly for every single CA this whole year. 

Some days when I’m walking on an overhead bridge, I just stop and wonder what would happen if I completely lose it one day and just make a bad decision. 

I don’t even know what I want out of writing this post, but nobody is willing to listen to me, so I thought i’d let it out here. My family keeps telling me that i’m not the only one who’s gone through JC so I should stop making a fuss and just study because it’s not that hard. 

Some days I just want to sleep all day and never wake up. Going to school is torturous. I don’t have that many friends that I feel comfortable opening up to either. 

If you made it this far, thanks. You don’t have to comment or anything. Like I said, I don’t know why I wrote this. Just like I don’t know what to do about my mess of a life now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ifia0o/a_levels_i_cant_do_this/,True,2020-08-24 20:24:19
45,[A levels] It's okay not to be okay,"I know as despicably cliche the title of this post is, and how it is a direct adaptation of Demi Lovato's song, it is meant to be encouraging, or perhaps to a certain extent, to relieve. I must say I have a whirlwind of thoughts in my head right now. And this is quite honestly just a platform for me to let things out before I promised myself to hit the books again.

Dear me (and everyone reading this). 

It's been a week since A levels started, some people found the papers exceptionally easy, whereas some people left college feeling empty, and perhaps slightly broken. It's okay.
I'm not gonna say what's done has been done. Because that's the shittiest advice anybody can ever give to someone who needs reassurance. Your strength comes not from doing the paper well. But from the knowledge you have gained whilst studying for it. I've also felt the dread and the numb pain in my heart when I flipped through the questions I didn't know how to do during the exam. I assure you that you didn't do even a pinch as bad as you think you did. Be more forgiving on yourself, for yourself. Build your confidence and study for the next paper.

Some of our parents/relatives have high expectations for us. Some may just impose the toxicity of comparison to your peers, maybe even put you down, ask you why you can't score well. Nothing beats the pain when your own mum and dad belittle you in front of others, or pedestalise your ""smarter"" friend whilst look at you with disdain. It's okay.
I know it's a hard pill to swallow when your parents diminish your already low confidence by undermining your efforts and results. It was indescribable, how I felt like shit when my mum told me (and I quote) ""what takes your friends 5 minutes to memorise, it takes you 50, why are you not as clever?"" I put on a nonchalant and ignorant facade, but on the inside I think i cracked. You may feel it too, if not good for you. But pls, desensitise yourself from such negativity. As harsh as it sounds, what they think of you wouldn't matter in a couple of years, or even months down the road. Don't be so hard on yourself.

Some of us developed anxieties and mental health burdens through the year of house arrest cos of covid. Or maybe through the stress of academics. Looking at the A level paper may have intensified the panic. But It's okay.
You are not alone. There are thousands of students who have psychological bulwarks in their minds because of their anxieties, perhaps me too. I'm not trivialising your mental health or saying you're part of many. But I want to assure you that we can and will get through it together. Emerge stronger, not take people's shit. The papers in the coming weeks are of no measure to your mental capacity. You're stronger than you're led to believe. I believe in you and I.

Many, many of us are pissed off at the education system of Singapore. Pissed that from as young as 8/9 yo we are made to have elitist mindsets, measure our worth against grades instead of growth, grow up thinking that if I don't do well, I'm an outcast. Spent countless hours in between books whilst out peers in the rest of the world enjoy a more holistic childhood/teenage. Angry that we are bound to the shackles of ""meritocracy"" when it's just the government sieving for the best and casting everyone else aside, to fend for themselves. But, as infuriating as the system is, tell yourself that it's okay.
This is close to impossible, the years you've spent studying aren't coming back. What's worse may be that you aren't doing well. But tell yourself that it's gonna be over soon. Mother yourself into thinking that what lies ahead is rosy enough for you to suffer in silence now.

At 18 years old, an average Singaporean JC student undergoes the most tumultuous, stressful, doubtful and downright painful experience of their student careers through the A levels. But I want you to hold hope that you will come out stronger. The system isn't going to change, but you will, for the better. Toxicities around you aren't going to change, but you will learn to deal with them maturely. The exam papers may be painstaking, but the knowledge gained from studying is etched in your mind for the foreseeable future. 
Its okay to feel like shit, but what matters is how you recover. Godspeed to the O's and A' candidates! Thank you for reading till the end hehe ily 🤟",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jpiffi/a_levels_its_okay_not_to_be_okay/,True,2020-11-07 18:04:42
46,[META] A foreign stranger wishing you luck,"Let's hope this tag works out

Well, I've actually never really posted a text on reddit, especially not on a subreddit that hasn't anything to do with memes.

I'm a German guy and I met a Singaporean girl here on reddit a few months ago, we're chatting everyday and sometimes call.

And rn she's really stressed because of her exams. We just called and she told me that all of Singapore is writing it's exams rn.
And she told me about this subreddit, with it's exams, chats, rants and much more.

So I had this idea of telling you all what I just told her:
It's not such a big problem if you don't believe in yourself.
Because I really believe in you. So many people believe in you, if it's friends, family, teachers or whoever.
And even if it goes wrong and you won't get the results you wanted, me and all these awesome people will still believe in you, and believe that you're going to make it the next time.

I didn't go to a highschool or to college myself, so I can just imagine the burden of stress which you are carrying on your shoulders rn.
And you really got my respect for that. At least you're trying something I would've never been able to do. I'm really proud of you all ^^

TL;DR:
I really believe in you all. You can and you will make it.
And if the girl I'm usually talking to reads this: I especially believe in you, go and become a doctor, go and make your parents proud!

47,[A LEVELS] THE TIME HAS COME,"hello everyone!

as the beginning of a levels draws nearer, and the anxiousness is setting in, ive decided to write this post to comfort myself, and to comfort those who need it. 

(insert your name), you have worked hard the past two years. the knowledge you have acquired through the sleepless nights, the early mornings, the consultations. the struggles you’ve had, getting extremely frustrated when you repeatedly just can’t seem to solve a question of a certain type, but was able to solve it after wrestling it and not caving in to the anger. you have indeed journeyed so far. 

(insert your name), you may feel like you have yet to cover all the content of the subject, yet may feel like you know nothing about the exam you are getting ready to take. but i wish to tell you that that is not true. everything you need is already inside of you. i repeat, everything you need is already inside of you! you just have to search a little in your brain which is overly cluttered with emotions now. a little digging, a little comforting, and the you will start to recall the information. but even if you do not/ can’t find it, don’t fret, move on buddy. 

(insert your name), for the next month to come, you will be engulfed with a tumultuous wave of emotions, feelings, unexplainable crying. but i want to tell you that it is ok. let it come, cry if you have to, be angry if you want to. release those emotions in you to relax your body. it is not healthy keeping it in. studied for 6 hrs straight but still feeling uncertain/ have yet to accomplish what you want to? brain clogged? GET UP! go for a walk. go for a run. go watch a funny video. go eat your favourite hawker dish. GET UP! stop worrying about your unfinished work. GET UP/ taking a break is not seen as being lazy, but an extremely important way to recalibrate your brain. you may be overwhelmed with guilt “oh i havent finish item 2,5,7,9 on my to-do list, i cant take a break yet!!!” but remember, our brain is a well-oiled machine, it needs to take regular breaks from overheating/ overwork. maintenance through self-care would allow this extremely beautiful machine to be sustained for a longer duration in the future. we are aiming for sustainability & consistency, not quantity. 

(insert your name), so my friend, you are ready. as much as you feel that you are not, trick yourself into thinking you are. the 50% of content you think you have, supplement it with 50% of confidence/ reassurance/ trust in your self. if you were to supplement the other 50% of fear/ lack of content/ have yet to finish studied all these topics/ self-doubt, you are going for war without your armour but only with the skills you have learnt during your training. so, arm your alter ego with confidence AND the skills you’ve acquired at your training. go in confident. do not show your enemy (the exam paper/ the examiner) your weakness, but the other 50% of strength you possess. 

all the best my brave warriors fighting this month long battle. you have worked hard, and you will be fine.✊🏻",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jl930i/a_levels_the_time_has_come/,True,2020-10-31 16:50:54
48,[RANT] SG Education System - Are we overly stretched?,"**Edit: Please leave comments pertaining to how you think the system can improve. Include something that is viable and feasible. I hope to not just use this platform to speak up about the situation, but also to collate feedback so that I can write in to the relevant ministry if possible.**

**It would also be extremely helpful if poly/IB students can express their views here and also explain a little about how your system works! I hope to bring up this matter and factor in all perspectives in play, which is, our whole education structure. Thanks guys!**

As the stress of promos start piling up and the people around me come to school with dark eye bags, falling asleep in class because of the late nights studying - I wonder how pushed to the limits Singaporean students are, in this education system that has integrated into the very backbone of our country, that has pervaded into our everyday life

I completely disagree with the notion of the notorious stacks of homework we have to complete, on top of the long hours of school. While I do agree that our main role in our lives when we are 7-18 is to be a good student, study hard, and pave the way for our own future, I'm starting to question if the workload is getting too much.

In the local landscape, we are encouraged to pursue our passions. However, the pre-cursor is for academics to remain at the highest priority. When we sign up for enrichment, be it music, or sports, how many of us actually stop our lessons because there is simply too much work to do? The things that we used to enjoy- how many of us still engage in our hobbies, or even find time to relax?

In actuality, students like us are brothers and sisters, daughters and sons. We have a family to be a part of, to look after, and to bond with. In actuality, students like us all have things that we love, whether it is coding or painting- we all have something that keeps us grounded. However, my question is: how much leeway is the Singapore education system giving us to explore new territory and new grounds of passion pursuit. While there is an emphasis on family construct, how much time is the Singapore education system allowing us to take out of our academics to spend quality time with our loved ones?

When we fail to turn up our assignments because we wanted to take some time off with our family or just to pursue what we love, we are tied to the autonomy of guilt. It is automatically considered incorrect if we prioritise ANYTHING above academics.

The competitive nature of this education system is making all of us believe that ""if I can't catch up, I'm a failure"". But this isn't true. Everyone has their own ways of coping with school and their academics. It does not have to be the conventional way of sticking through the whole year of lessons. This can get mentally draining for most.

I cannot emphasise enough how many of us students are suffering in silence. Perhaps not so much in silence, but the way we deal with things as a whole, it becomes normalised. Everyone does not get enough sleep, and we come to school everyday boasting about the 3 hours of sleep we had, before a friend comes over and say he had 2. It is crazy how we have to conduct our recreational activities only after we have finished what our school requires us to do. By then, how many hours do we even have left?

An average student can end at 6pm, with or without CCA. With transport home, it's about an hour, maybe more for some. By the time you shower and you finish your dinner, it's already close to 9. We start work soon after, and by then, we are mentally drained from the activities of the day, which is why our cognitive abilities slow down, and we take more than a couple hours to finish the heaps of work from each subject. If you're lucky, you sleep before 12. Otherwise, be prepared to sleep after midnight for the rest of your educational journey. Who has time for any other activities when after all of these, all you need is rest?

I'm trying to make a point, that our generation of students are expected to do everything, to be holistic and all-rounded in our academics and portfolio, even though everyone knows that being well-versed in many aspects is virtually impossible for an average individual.

So why, does this frame of education we are placed into, have such high expectations of us, with little concern for our mental and physical health? Something needs to change in this education landscape, before heaps and heaps of victims to the dark eye bags and constant naps in class start piling up, and the amount of sleep the average student gets in one night slowly, but surely, dwindles down to null.

*Edit: Some are attributing such pressures to bad time management. However my question is- we only have bad (i wouldn't say bad but for a lack of better term) time management simply because we do not have work-life balance. Instead of finding time to do work, we are constantly finding time to do the things we love. During breaks, we hang out with our friends, use our phones and I completely do not see anything wrong with this because some people just aren't made to study all the way. Rather, I would attribute this to different implications of the varying personalities we have. Some people are just programmed to do continuously studying because it brings them a great deal of satisfaction, where some people do not resonate with that fact. (see ""PS"" below) And that's okay. However, I hope that this group of more ""abled"" individuals do not undermine this line of thinking that an average student goes through, even if you don't understand it. Different viewpoints exist, and we are all just trying to share ours.*

*PS Take the strengthsfinder quiz to understand more about your own personality because it actually makes a difference and shows you what you value. I learnt how some of my classmates are more work-driven after a workshop. I completely understand this perspective and respect it as well.*",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iklhvz/rant_sg_education_system_are_we_overly_stretched/,True,2020-09-02 06:42:04
49,[o levels] tuition Teacher retaking as private candidate,"I’ve been wanting to say this for the longest time ever. Envisage this : your o level results fall short of your expectations. Your school does not allow you to retain, so your only option of making it to the poly/jc of your choice is to retake as a private candidate. Following this, you Mug like crazy rotating between your part time job and your studies to rectify the very mistake you made the previous year. Come to the o level exam. You sit down in the room hundreds of people surrounding you, but something catches your eye. A 30 something year old scribbles furiously onto his entry proof. Copying the  diagrams and questions at record speed while writing his own answers onto it . He finishes the paper in 25 minutes. When you receive your results the following year despite scoring a 92 in elementary maths you get a A2. When you check with your friends who are school candidates you realise with dismay that they got 90 but they scored an A1. This is merely a imaginative situation. And I have no idea what I’m writing but haha.


Many many tuition Teachers who work at tuition centres retake the o levels as a private candidates every single year . This is the disappointing reality. They merely retake every single year to smuggle the questions out and come up with answer keys for their students. I’m sure you saw many answer keys circulating around social media especially after the papers. Those are from tuition Teachers who actually retake the o level every single year. My tuition teacher included. She bragged at every single exam she will score an A1 inevitably and will get full marks. I also saw a marketing ploy by a tution centre which Disturbed me it went something like this : this teacher understands your pain !!! He’s retaking  as a private candidate so he will emphasise with you !!!! Imagine how they will affect the moderation. Although private candidate and school candidates moderation is different, many private students will lose their A1s and the products fo their hard work because these teachers retake the o levels every year which will adversely shift up the moderation. Although I am not a private candidate I strongly feel this is unjust in the worst way especially for those private candidate. Sure we get answer keys, but at what cost ? Those private candidates might miss out their chance to go to their dream school and course. I strongly believe MOE should take precautions which prevent these tuition teachers from taking the o levels. It is simply not fair.

50,[rant] Can't hold a conversation,"I can't hold a conversation to save my life. If I happened to walk past one of my classmates/ ex-classmates in school I'd very literally do anything and everything to avoid eye contact. Heck, I'd even de-tour and take an alternative route to avoid having to interact with them. I can't even bring myself to wave to them along the corridors, especially if they're in groups.

They're nice people. I don't really have beef with any of them but I literally can't physically bring myself to initiate a conversation or even say hi. They were really nice and really tried their best to include me at the start of the year, but considering how cold I've appeared to be I guess they just gave up eventually.  I don't blame them because, in all honesty, this is a personal issue. 

The ironic part is that I'm great at customer service. I can keep customers well entertained while they wait in line but when it comes to interpersonal relationships I'm just inapt. I remembered there was once when I went out with this guy and half the time I was just trying to avoid all of his questions (it did not go well, much to nobody's surprise). It was a silent and awkward meal (food was great tho LOL). 

The thing is, my life has been (and still is) an absolute scandalous train wreck, and there's literally no way to put it in a well, normal way. If anything's disclosed about my life outside of school my future would quite literally be ruined.  I'm sure that I won't be able to sustain relationships with my unwillingness to open up about my past, but simultaneously the tea is too hot to be spilt , so I just end up living by the ""can't ruin a friendship if it never started"" logic.

... salvage me, maybe.

No transport expenses.

No need to eat breakfast and lunch at a specific timing.

No need to choose what clothes to wear everyday.

No need to spend time to dry your hair, style your hair, do your makeup.

No need to wake up super early to catch shuttlebus or take a crowded train.

You can wake up 10 minutes before class.

You can record the whole lesson using third party software as long as you don't share it with anyone and play it as much as you want to look through parts that you missed.

If you're sick, just turn on your recording software and go rest up. After you recovered, you can look through the video for that lesson and skip downtime parts. 

For people who have hearing issue, you can even listen to the lecture using earpiece/headset which helps a lot.

Tired after class? Set alarm for next class and go straight to bed.

Hungry during class? Eat away.



I know many of you are looking forward to go back to school but do enjoy this while you can since it is only temporary and especially if you can cope. Anyone out here loving HBL too?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gxb0oq/poly_im_actually_loving_hbl_now/,True,2020-06-06 11:17:03
53,[Rant] Student Councils/Prefectorial Boards are a serious joke,"They may be called differently across schools, but most (if not all) educational institutions in Singapore should have something to that effect. Student Council, Prefectorial Board, Student Union, etc.

Safe to say that Student Council in most schools are mere platforms to social climb and build portfolios, not to ""act as role models"" or ""serve the school"" or whatever righteous bullcrap. Certainly, there are those who do believe in that and are passionate in serving as Student Councillors, but it is a relative minority.

Generally they actually do quite a fair bit for the school, a significant portion of the effort done behind the scenes. But the amount of backstabbing, petty drama, social climbing, and other awful sh\*t is insane. It's like a glimpse of the nightmare that is the adult corporate environment. 

And in some schools where the Student Council holds more power, you can almost always expect cronyism to happen. 

Case in point in my JC (not going to say which but er you can see my history if you're really that interested to know), every year there's at least one Student Councillor railroading his or her friend through the Orientation Group Leader (OGL) selection process, effectively guaranteeing said friend an OGL spot.

Quite a sad and sh\*tty place to be, frankly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k3ybex/rant_student_councilsprefectorial_boards_are_a/,True,2020-12-01 07:49:14
54,[O-levels] THE END,"HELLO
IT HAS BEEN A LOOOOOONG RIDE AND
WE’RE AT THE END OF THIS JOURNEY
YES WE ARE CLOSE TO COMPLETING OUR SEC SCHOOL LIFE do uk how cool that is???
ok anyways, “part of the journey is the end” It’s okay if you FEEL that you screwed up your papers :) there are also students out there on this very land who feels the same way! Remember you’re not alone okay :) don’t be too hard on yourself! give yourself a pat on the back you have tried your very best and we are all proud of you :) 
every end means a new beginning!!!!!! Maybe you would be able to enrol into your dream school, maybe Fate makes us go for other paths, disappointment is part and parcel of life! don’t let it beat you down okay JIAYOU AND ALL THE BEST FOR YOUR LAST PAPERS!!!!

55,[o levels] list of physics definitions,"hi yalls, so i've created a compiled list of physics definitions since all the definition qns are always a huge pain to do and also to refresh ur memory on certain concepts, enjoy!

(do also let me know if I made mistake anywhere or if i have forgotten to add something)  

&#x200B;

MEASUREMENT

* Scalar quantity: a physical quantity that has magnitude but no direction (eg: mass, distance, speed, quantity)
* Vector quantity: a physical quantity that has both magnitude and direction (eg: force, displacement, velocity, acceleration)

KINEMATICS

* Displacement: change in position of an object
* Speed: rate of change of distance (with respect to time)
* Velocity: rate of change of displacement (with respect to time)
* Acceleration: rate of change of velocity (with respect to time)
* Uniform acceleration: constant rate of change of velocity 

DYNAMICS

* Newton’s 1st law: an object will continue its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight line unless a resultant force acts on it
* Newton’s 2nd law: when a resultant force acts on an object of constant mass, the object will accelerate and move in the direction of the resultant force. The product of the mass and acceleration of the object is equal to the resultant force (F=ma)
* Newton's 3rd law: for every action (force), there is an equal and opposite reaction, and these forces act on mutually opposite bodies

MASS, WEIGHT, DENSITY

* Mass: amount of matter or substance in a body
* Weight: amount of gravitational force acting on a body
* Inertia: reluctance of a body to change its state of rest or motion, due to its mass

* Gravitational field strength: gravitational force per unit mass at a point
* Density: mass per unit volume

TURNING EFFECT OF FORCES

* Moment of a force: the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the pivot to the line of action of the force
* Principle of moments: when a body is in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about a pivot is equal to the sum of anticlockwise moments about the same pivot

* Atmospheric pressure: force per unit area exerted on a surface by the weight of air molecules above that surface in the Earth's atmosphere

ENERGY, WORK, POWER

* Energy: the capacity to do work
* Principle of conservation of energy: energy can neither be created nor destroyed, it can only be converted from one form to another or transferred from one body to another. Total amount of energy in an isolated system remains constant
* Work done: the product of the force on a body and the distance moved by the body in the direction of the force
* Power: rate of work done or rate of energy conversion

56,[O LEVELS] The Power of Sleep Deprivation,"This isn't a rant, but I just wanted to tell about my new discovery during O levels. I think my sleep deprivation may have unlocked some sort of sixth sense, supernatural type psychic powers within me LMAO

Alright so here's a short story regarding this discovery:
Before social studies exam, I was mugging as usual because my silly goose ass decided that social studies would be the least of my concern but before the day of the exam itself, my stress told me I should be studying. But me, also being a lazy person, wanted an easy shortcut out of studying so I decided to study topics that my gut feeling told me to do so. Don't laugh at me, but I tried hovering my hand above the contents page of the textbook like those psychics in the movies when they're trying to do some psychic-y bullshit and there was the strongest tingling sensation when my hand was above ""Issue 2"". I'm not the most superstitious person in the block, but I just thought ""Fuck it, I'm too lazy to study every issue here"" and I just hoped against hope that my gut feeling was right and studied Issue 2. I entered the exam feeling like an idiot but surprising, Issue 2 did come out.

You might be thinking, one incident doesn't mean you've immediately unlocked some sort of fictional psychic powers, but its wasn't just this once. Before Biology, I, again, was mugging because, again, I'm a lazy piece of shit who procrastinates until last second. I was touching up on my knowledge about pregnancy hormones and was flipping through the textbook to find the page. Suddenly, there it was again, the nagging feeling grew so strong when I flipped through one section of the textbook. I went back to that section, ""Effects of tobacco smoke"". I smirked, surely Cambridge won't test this, they would probably test the harder topics, I thought. But even as I wrote down my notes for the other chapters, this little feeling grew more intense like a bubbling cauldron in my stomach until eventually, I gave in to the demands of my gut feeling and studied the effect of tobacco smoke till I felt like never ever smoking in my life. 

I entered the exam feeling like an idiot again, but guess what? That's right, one question about tobacco smoke came out which I would never have been able to answer if I hadn't studied for it. I literally did the ""pog"" face when I saw that question, I genuinely couldn't believe my eyes. I left the exam hall feeling like a million dollars, I couldn't believe I could just predict questions like that.

Anyways this is just a really silly story, I'm not a superstitious nor a very religious person, but its just the most surprising thing that happened to me these past few weeks and I wanted to share it with someone without them thinking I've lost all my marbles or had a few screws loose. Thanks for reading!

Edit: AAAAAAA don't tell me to predict your topics I'm genuinely afraid someone might take me too seriously and then they fail because of some 16 year old's ""magic man"" predictions, please just do the best of your ability I believe in everyone and I hope everyone does well for their last papers.!! ❤

EDIT NUMBER 2: it wasn't issue 2 that came out but issue 1, rip my make-believe ""psychic powers"" my gut already failed me at the start, I knew this was too good to be true 😔💔💔",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jk7hx2/o_levels_the_power_of_sleep_deprivation/,True,2020-10-30 02:22:13

58,[Rant] What your exams screwed up stories?,"I was from TP, sitting for a common test (20%). During the last 5mins, I could hear a commotion outside, I could hear something about a 10mark last qn. I'm like, ""THERE IS A 10 MARK QUESTION?'

I flipped to the back, seeing a 10mark question blank. Paper was upon 50, if have 0 marks on this, I would need perfection from previous pages to get an A. My eyes were legit popping out and anxiety shooting through the roof. I could feel my flight-fight response kana activated and used it to fill in what I could.

Got 1.5 marks from that question.

Thankfully, I got full marks from the previous qns, still securing an A.

59,[Uni] NTU messed up my application,"STORYTIME.

I emailed the admissions office on the morning of 22 May as I had yet to receive any application outcome or update from NTU.

To protect my identity, I’m gonna use a FAKE NAME AND EMAIL that is very similar to the real one and the context of the situation. For example, let’s say my name is Charlotte Seah. But, I go by ‘Charlutte’ in my email address ([charlutte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlutte.seah@abc.com)). 

In my application for NTU, I stated the use of the email address: ([charlutte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlutte.seah@abc.com)) to receive any updates from NTU regarding my application. It was already 22 May and I didn’t receive any application outcome. I went on to send an enquiry email to the admissions office.

I suddenly remembered that I have an old email account from primary school with my name spelled properly, ([charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)). I don’t use it anymore because it’s filled with spam. Then, this thought came: Could it be possible an error was made and they sent it to this email instead? But I also thought no way man, how can NTU make such a mistake. I even double-checked my own application to see if I stated the correct email: ([charlutte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlutte.seah@abc.com)). 

But no harm trying right? I had to dig far into my memories to find the password for ([charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)) and I finally managed to log in. Lo and behold my most iconic moment of 2020. On 7 April, my second choice course sent an email interview invite to ([charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)). 

This meant that I was already rejected from my first choice course LONG ago and had false hope for two months. I was not upset about being rejected from my first choice. I was upset because the longer I waited for an application outcome, the more hopeful I became, thinking my first choice course was still considering me and I was on some kind of waiting list. Seeing that email on the old primary school email account made me realise the cold hard truth. I felt like I was punched in the face and I broke down because it was too much to handle. 

After the email that was sent on 7 April, two more emails were sent to rush me to confirm the interview date. Obviously, I was unaware and didn’t respond to them. Although I also own the ([charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)) account, I do not use it anymore and I DID NOT state this email address in my application. Also, if they didn’t get a response from me why couldn’t they give me an SMS or a call? I heard some of my peers receiving SMS from the NTU business course to notify them for an interview. So why was my second choice course not sending out SMS? Luckily I still had access to ([charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)), what if I didn’t? What if it didn’t exist at all? I would have found out even later and missed the deadline for appeal. Nonetheless, this mistake still delayed me from appealing for my first choice course and reduced the amount of time I had to prepare the appeal.

I also realised that the email interview invite was manually sent by the assistant professor of the course. This means that it was highly-likely a human error. But still, I really want to know why the error was made. Was it due to a typo or an assumption was made that the email was ‘[charlotte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlotte.seah@abc.com)’ instead of ‘[charlutte.seah@abc.com](mailto:charlutte.seah@abc.com)’. If they really gei kiang (act smart) I got nothing to say. 

I went on to send a complaint to the admissions office and also responded to the assistant professor to inform her of her mistake. I received a reply from the assistant professor on 23 May at 12:41 AM. The professor apologised but then went on to say because of the Covid-19 circuit breaker, ‘The office was shut down, professors communicated with the applicants they were to interview individually, rather than in pairs, which is the usual practice. The administrative staff was also unable to double check all communications.’

I’m not sure if it’s because I’m in an emotional state right now but from what I understood, it sounds like she is saying this mistake happened because nobody double-checked for her LOL. She did not exactly tell me why she made the error too (like was it a typo or assumption or something else?). For the admissions office, I have yet to receive a reply.

But remember what I said in the beginning? I sent an enquiry email on the morning of 22 May, before this whole saga happened. I got a reply and they had the audacity to tell me that my application was still processing. This goes to show that NTU doesn’t even bother to check each enquiry properly. I am speechless. I responded with another email explaining the whole situation. I’m excited to see what kind of reply I will get on Monday/Tuesday. :)

I have friends that ask me what do I expect out of all of this? I probably need to provide NTU some sort of solution. Well, what affected me the most was the disappointment and emotions that came along. But, it’s not like NTU can do anything to compensate for that. I’m not gonna ask for a refund because they have indeed processed my application. I wanted to ask for an extension of the appeal deadline but it was already Friday and I bet they wouldn’t get back to me before the deadline (24 May). I quickly wrote my appeal and submitted it on the evening of 23 May. Right now, I just want to hear their explanation.

60,[Uni] Rejected by all universities. And this is how I felt. what about you?,"I will never forget this stage of my life. A period of constant paranoia that was fueled by the immense helplessness. For a prolonged period, I would click on my Gmail icon every morning, hoping to receive a response to my university applications. To no avail, my inbox was always empty though there were times when junk mails or Zalora would get my hopes up until I saw the sender. At this stage, there were moments when I felt angry at the admissions for giving me such a torturous suspension. The waiting period was unbearable, it was like an unreachable itch at the back of my mind and it would creep up on me whenever I was isolated or not doing anything. At that time, I just wanted everything to have a result, I just wish they would end my misery by cutting me loss. Thoughts like “just reject me already please” ran through my mind all the time,  I felt like a war warrior who just wanted to quickly get shot at the battlefield to ease the suspension.

Little did I know that suspension was way better than the reality, there was hope, at least. On the 14th of May 2020, 10 days before the first acceptance window deadline, I learnt that many of my friends had gotten their offers at the top three universities. And that skyrocketed my hope because I thought I might have a chance since I scored similar rank points as them. That night, I turned on my laptop and went on to the official student portal excitedly, hoping that I could share a similar fate as my friends. However, the results were not in my favour. I was bluntly rejected by NUS, SIT and SUTD, all the universities that I had applied to basically. That was when I started to appreciate the torturous suspension I had a few seconds ago and I realised my preparation for this undesirable outcome was merely a paper-thin bulletproof vest that could not defend the nuclear-like reality. The reality was much harsher than I expected. Looking at the glowing “Rejected” my mind went blank, my vision blurred, darkened and I spaced out.

Shock, sadness, disappointment, helplessness and shame, all of them colluded, turned into an iron fist and punched me hard right at my windpipe. To be honest, never have I ever imagined that was how breathtaking feels like. Not only was I unable to inhale at the point, but I was also overwhelmed by the immense sensation of pain. It was not a quick stab kind of a pain but rather a slow burn. It felt like a skilled butcher with a blunt blade, aimed at my chest, penetrated through my skin, my flesh, my bones and added a twist when it reached my heart.

A friend of mine asked if I was ok, I replied yes. “Yes”, just seemed to be the best candidate to describe this emotional turmoil. God knows how long had I spent looking at my ceiling before falling asleep but what else could I have done? Crying? Screaming? Leaping off a bridge? Nah. It was a moment of chaotic nothingness, I did not know what to do or where to go. My mind was just blank, blank, blank.

62,[O levels] tips for the big day tomorrow (emath p1),"it’s finally here, the great battle we’ve all been preparing for. Felt a bit kind today so imma share a bunch of tips that i personally find useful ;))

1. your mindset is WAY more important than you’d expect. It is crucial to go inside the exam hall with a positive attitude. i cannot stress enough on how important this is, so i’ve put this as the first point. Enter the exam hall with the thought that you’re going to ABSOLUTELY CRUSH the exams!! That doesn’t mean be complacent, but rather, be CONFIDENT. What i love to do is play a song that makes me feel like an absolute boss in my head. Also, keep reminding yourself that no matter what the results are, it is NOT the end of the world because believe it or not, Os have a minimal impact on your life in a matter of 5-6 years. SO STRUT INTO THE EXAM HALL LIKE AN ABSOLUTE GOD BECAUSE YOU’RE A GODDAMN BOSS!!!

now, we’re getting into the meat of it: the actual process of doing the paper. here’s my tips on how to absolutely smash the paper.

2. emath paper 1: were given 2 hours to complete the paper. How do we make excellent use of this time? This is by having a game plan. How to devise a game plan? Plan out your time to the smallest detail. You don’t have to spend much time doing this. In fact, do it while waiting for the paper to start. 1-2 mark questions shouldn’t take more than 2-3 mins. 3-4 mark questions shouldn’t take more than 3-4 mins and 5-6 mark questions, not more than 10 mins. If you’re having trouble with the question, circle it and MOVE ON!! don’t waste your time on that question and end up giving up marks on the subsequent questions by wasting all your time on that one question.  So essentially, it is EXTREMELY important to be smart with your time. 

3. so the paper has started. and it’s pretty tough ngl, you’re starting to panic. chill out, i gotchu. Take in a deep breath if you need to and wipe the sweat off your palms. Panic is the enemy, don’t let it get to you or you’ll lose the battle. Let’s say, you don’t know how to approach the question. Write down every possible formula you can use to solve the question in pencil. Use trial and error till you figure it out. For every calculation u make, state what you just calculated in brackets. This way, you won’t get confused by the values and you’ll spot your mistakes easily and rectify them during the checking time. If you still can’t find the answer, don’t panic. Just move on. Ensure that you’ve written down all your workings because you might still be able to secure method marks for the question, do NOT leave the question blank, because that’s an immediate zero for the question. Now, it is a matter of losing as little marks as possible, not getting as many marks as possible, so read the question thoroughly before answering it so as to not make any careless mistakes while attempting the question.

4. ok, you’ve completed your paper and now you have 15-20 minutes to spare before the paper officially ends. Do not waste this crucial time by playing with your pens or sleeping (damn bo liao leh this one lol) This is the most important stage of the exam; it’s your checking time. Every second counts, so check EVERY question, EVERY LINE if u need to. Let’s say you don’t have much time left, only 5 mins. Don’t panic, just skim through the entire paper once. It is important to know which areas you make the most number of careless mistakes in, or which question was the trickiest, so go to those questions first and scan for any possible mistakes. Work backwards and see if you get back to the original value. If you don’t, you probably made a mistake. After rectifying every mistake you could’ve possible made, scan the paper through one last time and you’re all good :)

5. THE PAPER HAS ENDED, YOU DID IT BUDDY!! YOU’RE STILL ALIVE!! IM PROUD OF YOU🥳🥳 now, that paper isn’t your problem anymore, so let it go.

A little background story: I graduated from polytechnic in 2019, got a pretty okay GPA, matriculated to NUS for academic year 2019/2020, dropped out after a little over 2 months, took a gap year/ forced myself to take a gap year, matriculate to local uni this academic year 2020/2021.

2019 was one of the best but also one of the worst year of my life. I graduated from poly with a rather high gpa and applied to a prestigious course in NUS (for the sake of privacy I will not disclose which course I entered). I guess if you're like me, you don't actually know what you want to do with your life or your future, so my first big no-no was applying to a degree course closest to my GPA. I never really had passion for it but I figured since I had the luxury to choose almost anything, I decided to try! I went for the interview and eventually got offered a place in NUS. I was so happy, so proud of myself because I was a nobody but NUS offered me a place! wow

I joined RAG, I went to orientation, I went to camps I never thought I would (I'm an introvert so I don't like being out of my comfort zone), I made awesome friends, I was pretty cheerful. My life was more or less set, until school started.

Lectures, tutorials and practicals were almost the same as polytechnic but double the content. I was suddenly thrown into this pool of highly intelligent people. Huge imposter syndrome am I right? but you can't blame yourself for feeling like drowning when your classmates are from top JCs, top so and so, and I wallowed in self pity. Granted, no one actually looked down on me because I was from poly, in fact they were supportive and me coming from a different background became a conversation starter, but it was me in my own thoughts, and I was falling into depression.

Till today I can't pin point when things started to go haywire. I cried everyday on my way to Kent Ridge MRT, I told myself to zombie up and just attend school because no one should know that I'm suffering in my own thoughts. I needed help, but didn't know who or how to ask, or rather, I didn't know whats wrong, I just couldn't stop crying. I was torn between ""don't give up"" and ""do what is best for yourself"".

I chose the latter and dropped out after 2 months.

I remember submitting my withdrawal form to the office, hoping they'll at least talk me out of it or ask me things like ""are you sure?"", but the process was quick and straight to the point. You surrender your student card and continue with your day.

Here are a few things you should know

1. People say that when you leave NUS, there's a high chance that NUS wouldn't accept you back. - Which is true for my case because when you actually apply the next year, you apply under a separate tab and I got my rejection letter a few weeks ago.
2. But with that said, you can still apply to other local universities under the normal JC/ Poly tab. They treat you like a normal applicant. You just have to declare that you have used up one/ how ever many semesters of your government subsidised tuition fees (which is an issue you have to consider before withdrawing from school because boy unsubsidised tuition fees are expensive).
3. If you asked if I would drop out of NUS now, my answer would still be yes. Some people are driven by stress but unfortunately people like me don't know how to deal with emotions properly. I honestly feel like I would've actually lost my mind if I continued with school.
4. Now that you are forced into a gap year/ have been planning to take a gap year, make use of your time! I applied for a full-time job so I don't have to take pocket money from my parents, eventually left and applied for part-time jobs nearing the end of my gap year, learnt a new hobby, went to explore SG on my own, did so many things I wouldn't have done if I wasn't forced to take a gap year.
5. You have all the answers to all of your questions. When it was time to re-apply, I panicked. What now? I still don't have passion, I'm not very good at many things, I even almost did a private degree I had no interest in. But when it came down to the last day of applications, I decided that I'll choose the course I'm least likely drop out in, the course that I feel wouldn't make me give up no matter how difficult it was. Yes you can ask around to see if this course suits you, but people have their one-sided opinions on many things which really doesn't help. Things like ""this course has no future"", ""this course is difficult"", really doesn't help.

I starting school this coming semester and I am equally excited and scared, but I'm proud of myself for going through this painful and lonely journey. I can't say I'm more mature now, but definitely making better choices.

TLDR: Enrolling to NUS was the best mistake I ever made (of course the most expensive mistake too). I am extremely thankful for the people who went through this journey with me on the sidelines, and I am seeking help for my anxious thinking.

To end this post with a quote I heard over the radio, "" When things get tough, learn to take a break, not give up."".

I'm quite a softie so if you need anything/ would like to ask me more my chat is open! I would gladly reply!

64,[Rant] Thanks for trying to give me your foolscap papers,"This is not really a rant, in fact it is the total opposite but I can't really find a suitable flair :/

Long story short I went to SB today to revise but my dumb as brain forgot to bring foolscap papers so I ended up using SB paper napkins to do my math lol. It was kinda fine cuz I was progressing at snail speed so I didn't really need a lot of paper, but I met this really kind stranger who offered me a stack of foolscap. I rejected him cuz I felt too paiseh to just take them for free, I hope I didn't appear like an arrogant kid when I said ""it's okay, thanks"" :/, I mean I rmb I smiled but idk man. He was sitting beside me so I couldn't help but to peek at his table and saw a graphing calculator lol. Probably a fellow JC student also doing math? Idk. Anyway, you might or might not be here but I just wanted to say thank you so so much, even though I didn't use your foolscap, you kinda made my day. We are total strangers and u were willing to give me ur foolscap (is it A Level gang spirit lol) and like ya know sometimes it's not easy to offer help cuz fear of rejection.

Also, to make this a relevant rant post, I kinda feel that this kinda kindness is like kinda (lol that's a lot of kind) rare nowadays, especially in JC :/. Like idk, it's just how I feel deep down, like we're all on our own, nobody is really genuine, people are not really there to help (maybe we're all to tired to care for one another :,<), and people are judgemental. Competitive environment is kinda real in JC? Idk how to say lol but I kinda feel its existence. I don't even make sense anymore but ok this paragraph is to make this a rant post so that it doesn't get removed for being irrelevant. Can someone prove to me JC is really competitive or prove me wrong lol cuz I really don't know which is true (I kinda feel it but it also seems to be non-existent😮).",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iouv5b/rant_thanks_for_trying_to_give_me_your_foolscap/,True,2020-09-09 06:46:27
65,[A Levels] Advice on how to become motivated to study,"Note : This is applicable for everybody! If you're in poly, O levels, A levels, university, it doesn't really matter.

I've been seeing a lot of posts talking about lack of motivation with the CB, not wanting to do anything, etc. Here are a couple of tips from someone who used to procrastinate a ton at home and was super unmotivated when studying.

The first thing you need to do is establish reason. Why are you studying? What do you hope to accomplish beyond getting good grades? For me the primary reason was spite, to spite my parents, my friends, and also my low self esteem and certainty of failure by showing all of the above I could do well. Very petty, yes. If you can't find a general reason beyond 'get good grades so I can get high paying job' the second most important thing you can do is establish interest. 

I remember I loathed chemistry. I still dislike H2 Chem. Everything about the subject just seemed endlessly, ceaselessly difficult to the point where I didn't even want to do anything. Then I stumbled across a couple of YouTube channels, namely Explosions&Fire and Explosions&Ire(where a man mixes chemicals go BOOM!), and Nilered, one of whose videos was about melting impure gold to create pure gold. I realised that chemistry was something more than just stupid, annoying, formulas, that it had real world applications you could use and that really helped me to proceed with the subject. Maybe you might hate real world applications of something and like the abstract theory more. Create interest in your subjects!

Some other things to keep in mind when studying :

A) I was always slacking in my room, so I went to my mum's room to study. Go to another location and designate it to studying, so you only go there whenever you study. This helps create a routine. 

B)Pomodoro technique. Saved my life. I used the 25 min work 5 min break and I was so much more productive than if I decided to sit in one place for 1.5hrs without using this method. Seriously, it works. 

C) Putting my phone in another room as I worked on my laptop. I eventually started to associate my laptop with work and my phone with play, so even if I watched a couple of YT videos on my laptop it didn't ruin my studying streak. 

D) Naps! I napped every three hours for 10-15 min with soothing music playing in my earphones to lull myself to sleep faster and also 7 alarms set to ensure I'd wake up on time. It helps decrease headaches caused from staring ceaselessly at the PC and also from trying to digest material. I also used to put wet cotton strips over my eyes, which really diminishes the eye pain you get from staring at screens(not just a girly facial mask thing) after leaving it on for 10 ish minutes. 

E) Coffee and tea. Self-explanatory.

F) Getting my 8 hours of sleep. ANYBODY WHO SAYS THEY CAN SURVIVE ON FIVE IS LYING. It should be 6.5-9 hours for everyone. Prolonged sleep deprivation reduces concentration and ability to focus, so when you think you're being more productive cramming late at night, you're actually much less productive. Even if you drink coffee. Get your beauty sleep. 

G) Not cramming! I never created summaries or pretty notes. Instead, I had flashcards that I created and memorised the formula. I revised them periodicially - say I start on the 26. I revise them next on the 27, then 29, then 2, then 6, so on and so forth. Apparently the brain has a forgetfulness curve so you need to target when your memory is weakest. I also used Anki! For more information, look up the explanation behind why Anki is structured the way it is, too long for me to explain. It worked anyway, went from D for last prelim exam to B in H2 chem, like 8 weeks or so apart. So use the flashcard method! You can make it more interesting(and it is generally advised) to associate a concept with a picture or a story, your brain remembers that better. 

H) Exercise when you feel antsy and restless. Restores equilibrium. 

I) Create a general list of tasks to do in the day. Do NOT assign yourself too much stuff. You will just feel demotivated and crash and burn. I had this spreadsheet not of detailed timelines, but general specifics. For example, I need to get Organic Chem Alcohols chapter in flashcards, do the tutorial questions, and any supplementary questions on the school website. Today is Monday. I give myself until Wednesday(or Thursday, if I'm stretching it), to complete this task. I can do everything on Monday or  I can finish it all by Thursday. But I have to do it before Friday. This is much more manageable than 'OMG I HAVE SEVEN HARD THINGS TO DO TODAY LET ME HAVE A MENTAL BREAKDOWN'(yes i have been there lol)

Also, on flashcards. I created an Excel document where I would write the flashcards for a particular chapter and note the dates when I did them. This helped me keep track because by the end there were a lot of flashcards. I also colour filled in according to proficiency(Green for good, Yellow for Okay, Red for very bad) at remembeing. So if I did Acid-base Equilibrium the 7th and I couldn't remember anything I would do it again on the 8th. But if I also did Enthalpy on the 7th and I remembered it really well I'd redo it on the 11th or 12th. This was the only detailed spreadsheet I ever made. Please do this to keep track of where you're lacking and where you're doing well!

J) Before studying, play a song! Always play the same song. I used to always play Veridis by Daft Punk, then later switched to Conversations by Mac Miller. Any genre. The minute you're done, you grab your books and start studying. 

K) Forgot to add. I used to go on walks whenever I hit a plateau. If you feel safe enough doing that now go for it, otherwise you can start your walks a couple of months later.

Also, I used a lot of positive self-talk(you're amazing, can kick this question's ass) even if I didn't necessarily believe it. I mothered myself. It was nice to hear myself say these things about me even if I did not completely believe them to be true(no, I do not have DID). 

On days when you absolutely try EVERYTHING but you still cannot concentrate on anything and just want to stare at the ceiling and cry, you don't touch the books and do something that relaxes you. Speak to your friends. Speak to your family. Make a bomb recipe that you've been wanting to try out(and also eat). You will be back in the game tomorrow and so you will have unfettered freedom this one day. Please do not do this too many times, or use it as an excuse to get out of studying. You will not make it if you do that. 

FINALLY! If you're a perfectionist and cannot bear the thought of failure, remember that you need to fail to succeed. They are two sides of the same coin. You do not magically get good at something. You start from being crummy but you have to work your way up. You cannot just magically arrive at the other end. Life does not work like that. Your failing at something is the pathway to your success, but you must be determined to try and not fall prey to your insecurities. 

That got really philosophical towards the end lol. If anyone has any other suggestions please leave them in the comments! I hope people will find this useful.

u/-MhB addressed something that's really important, and that's self-discipline. You must have self-discipline in order to create study habits. Motivation is not going to get you through the days when you want to play games on your phone all day, your built in study habits will. You must build a routine. Towards the end I was putting it 7-9h a day(which some people might consider the lower end of the spectrum). I was only able to do that by creating a study routine and habit, because motivation is a very fickle mistress.

67,"[A Levels] Keep your head up, you'll be just fine","For some, tomorrow marks the beginning of the treacherous journey called A Levels. I'm sure many of you at this point are drowning in fear—overwhelmed by anxiety & uncertainty in whether or not you can perform as well as you'd intend.

I'm not here to provide any last-minute study tips (a*nyways, I'm sure many of you've already scoured through the internet to discover your secret formula for the ultimate study session/schedule)* I'm just here to remind you to **believe in yourself.** 

As you take your first steps into this month-long venture, please hold on to all the strength and determination that you possess. You've come so far from where you once were. You've fought through so much and pushed through mountains of anguish to be where you are today. Don't let your hard work go to waste by **underestimating your ability to perform**. 

The A-Levels drag on for quite a while, so you're going to need quite a fair bit of mental stamina to get through it all. If you do end up making mistakes along the way, please don't harp on it and try your best to work on the next paper. You can't rewind time, but the future is in your hands. 

I don't know if this post will reach anyone, but I do hope that anyone who reads this knows that they'll make it through the coming month just fine. 

p.s please don't neglect your mental health. You need proper nutrition and rest to perform at your peak. If anybody ever needs to rant or a shoulder to cry on, feel free to send me a message :)

68,[Rant] I hate exams,"In primary school, everything was for the best PSLE score.

In secondary school, everything was for the best O-Level score.

In JC, everything was for the best A-Level score.

Wake up, school, study, sleep. Rinse and repeat.

That was what my life was like between ages 7-18. 

I thought it would get better in uni. “It will be fun”, they said. “You’ll be learning fun things”, they said. “No more high-stakes exams”, they said.

Well, they were wrong.

It’s still all about studying. Get the best grades, the best CAP/GPA, and then the best job. 

Everything for the sake of a stupid number.

I’m so tired. Can’t I just learn in peace? Why do I have to keep training myself to do X amount of questions in Y minutes? Why should I have to memorise books and texts filled with information that anyone with an internet connection can easily access on Google? Why does my life path have to be decided by a series of numbers on a few pieces of paper?

And when we enter the working world, it’s going to be more of the same, right? KPIs to meet, assessments to pass.

69,[Rant] My post A levels sucks,"I will keep this short as I just need a place to rant. Can’t post on r/Singapore cause my parents browses that sub.

Context:A Levels over, time to chill. I’m doing basically what every kid does after a major exam. Game, watch shows, hang out with friends, sleep and wake up late.

A week ago, my mum got fed up that I was staying up past 12 playing games w friends, barges into my room and starts nagging about how I should fix my sleep schedule since I don’t need to stay up to study.

It turns into a lecture about how I should be preparing for Uni Applications, upcoming competitions (am athlete) and NS (wtf??). Tried explaining to her that there’s still time before (most likely April intake) and during NS. “Life does not give you a break…..you’re gonna fail A levels, cannot enter Uni, then waste a year after NS to figure out your direction isit?” …more bs ensues

Queue 2nd part of lecture, she starts comparing me to “ambitious kids outside of SG” and wished that I didn’t hang out with my friends which she calls “random people”.

For the icing on top of the cake, she then lets me know that they have no faith in me because I “failed them over and over again”, I’m gonna be a troublemaker in NS cause I’m not streetsmart and I’m a lazy kid with no life vision. And I sleep a lot cause I’m lazy and definitely not cause I’m depressed AF even after exams. Thanks for the confidence boost mom.

PLEASE READ THANKS,"Firstly to those who love studying outside of your house  can you please be considerate to those people who are trying to find seats to eat? Don't be inconsiderate by chopping like so many seats by putting your things everywhere like as if it is your house.

Secondly stop littering by scattering your paper everywhere >:( and when my workers tell you do not study here kindly do not shout back and ignore. Imagine if it is you working and the students just litters everywhere and not listen to you how would you feel?

 Recently : We have taken the necessary action by taking the cctv footage of those who are not listening to us and shouting back at us.We have reported to your school already and we have banned you coming to our place since you can't abide by the rules.

Thirdly can we just work together as a community just to avoid studying outside right now? Covid19 is still alive just to let you know. Don't be inconsiderate and just treat it like it is nothing.  I know many like studying outside but just for the sake of covid please try and avoid studying outside of your home and school or tution.

71,[Rant] - Discrimination towards N Level Students,"I just felt like ranting anonymously and getting things off my chest. You may skip this post if you’d like to. 

 I’m perpetually tired of people discriminating N level students saying things like “you’ll never succeed in life” “ITE student ah?” “N level score 40 points?” “study so hard for what?” I’m sure that when we were 12, many of us did not see the importance of PSLE. When I was 12, I did not even know PSLE was such an “important” examination. I feel extremely livid when people create a stigma of us being low and are seem as less intelligent as compared to students from the express stream. 

I have friends who are in the normal academic stream, grappling with their parents divorce, facing financial difficulties at a young age. Despite all of that, they still work their hardest in their academics. People do not see the efforts and sacrifices they make and instead of encouraging them that they are doing well, they criticise and label all Normal (T) and (A) students as “lazy” or give hurtful remarks such as “useless” 

In schools, I would really appreciate it if teachers could also spare a thought for us N level students. I do know that Os are much more difficult than Ns and teachers would need to prioritise O level students more. But we are constantly being neglected. Just from my own personal experience: there was this once where I proposed the idea of having extra lessons for the n level students because Ns are usually earlier than Os. I’ve heard Teachers saying things like “the class confirm noisy, not productive” and Teachers preferring not to take the N level classes because they already have the perception of us being boisterous..

Do I feel hurt when people perceive us as someone who will never succeed in life? Yes. After all, it is the O levels that matters because it very much determines one’s future.... 

If you have made it till this far, thank you for reading this... I just needed a place to rant because I feel hurt :)

What I do hope tho is that people could possibly change their negative mindset and attitude towards N level students 🙂

72,[Rant],"i’m currently working part time as a cashier. and honestly just want to rant because while some older generation lament that the young are rude and unreasonable, indulgent and what not. honestly, from what i’ve observed working for the past week (maybe it’s too early to say but i just want to say it), it is honestly the elderly that infuriates me. yes, i may be generalising them and yes it is true that there are really some elderly who are genuinely and sincerely kind-hearted. but i would say out of 10 elderly, 9 are ludicrous and obnoxious. however, from all the young i’ve seen, even those ah bengs or those who smoke/with tattoos, they were really polite and nice. they would never rush me even when they waited very long due to the long queue. whereas the elderly would be complaining ‘you very slow ah you cashier! can see how long the queue! you still slow slow!’, while the young would go ‘it’s ok we can see the queue long. don’t rush, will make mistake. we waited alr can still wait again’ 

and really it is those days where some millennials would say ‘it’s ok we can see you are trying your best, that’s enough’ that really warms my heart. 

i think it’s time we use a different view to look at our young generation. and it’s time for most of the elderly to stop thinking they are entitled. yea yea you build our nation and whatnot. honestly, who are those who truly build our nation? i believe that those who really put in the effort as a pioneer, they are those who are humble and understand the difficulties we young are going through now (the 1/10 elderly).

74,[rant] to the one struggling with mental health and acads:,"shout out to all the kids having panic attacks in bathrooms because of oral presentations. shout out to all the kids who are consumed by gripping numbness/anxiety/hopelessness when they get out of bed every single morning to face another day of school. shout out to all the kids who struggle to eat.  shout out to every single person who is struggling with a mental disorder and doing their best to live a normal life and doing their best to perform decently in school. i don't know what kind of symptoms/struggles/confusions currently haunt you, but i am here to tell you that you are so valid. you're going to get through the educational system. you're possibly going to get more out of it than your perfect, emotionally stable peers. you're going to come out with an unmatched awareness of what truly matters, you'll come out with a quiet strength and the true dignity of living within your means despite shitty circumstances that are out of your control. i just want you to know you're strong. i just want you to know you don't deserve it. you don't deserve all the learning difficulties and the emotional outbursts and the suicidal thoughts and all the things that come with having mental health struggles. i want you to know it's not an excuse. it's a valid part of you. a part of you, but not one that defines you. i want you to begin to believe that cliche notion that ""you are not your grades"". because you are truly not. no educational system completely honours the intricate complexities of every gift a living, breathing, thinking human-being holds. the lifeskills and the strengths and treasures deep within you that will not reflect in your grades but will most definitely manifest in your life. i know it is so hard to maintain the will to take another breath as you hold the paper you've just failed, as you wonder if you'll promote this year, as you can't breathe and cry quietly in class carrying legitimate shame. i've done that shit before, and wah guys i really still do it so much. i know how you feel. i am just like you. i believe in u. and you’re not alone! every time you go into panic attacks or whatever it is, know that someone else has just gotten through one, or is about to go into one. like it’s not strange or weak or bad, it’s unfortunately a part of many wonderful deserving capable people who still will struggle through these things and attain success in their own right.

*think of your darkest hour, and all the beautiful rays of light or the happiness and peace and laughter in between then and now, when perhaps youre beginning to struggle again. you got through that, and dude trust me it’s not easy to struggle through these things. you are going to get through this, as you've done before. and you’re never alone. rooting for yall*

i remember preparing for Os this time last year, and feeling like consistently suicidal w/ my crippling anxiety and cyclical emotional fluctuations. was stressed that my grades were slipping, especially in a particular subject X i used to like ascertain my value as a person and self-worth. a lotta my friends were like level 800 muggers. i was ridiculously unmotivated because of a sheer lack of energy. now, i'm absolutely failing subject X again after Os lol. but basically i'm realising more and more how trivial grades are. of course this won't stop you from stressing about that upcoming exam. but as i hear stories of just how truly and wonderfully people can make a suitably happy and fruitful life for themselves without desperately clinging onto a set of grades, esp as society moves towards like a less traditional route in the erm job market, i'm beginning to see that there are so many more paths one can walk down in life. the academic system is no longer as narrow and elitist (i say this in like a career opportunities sense not a social stigma sense)- no one cares if you got one set of good grades and entered a particular school years ago. i suppose it's also counterproductive to push yourself until you break or lose your grip on... the beautiful person you are?? because of grades, which are so, so fleeting and temporary. Olvl six pointers failing JC vvv common, i'd know... IP kids, GEP kids, struggling to promote, also vvv common. we try so so hard but ultimately, at the end of it all, this is imo haha if u guys would agree; but isn’t it a little bit of a chasing after the wind? grades cannot be traded for worth; it’s not guaranteed no matter how hard we push ourselves, and yet we still jeopardise our mental health for it. it's a life lesson we come to grips with slowly; in the same way, i encourage you guys to tryy to take care of you, a deserving and wonderful and strong person. take care of your mental and physical health. you'll be a tiny bit more refreshed and calm as you tackle the intimidating mundaneness of your course content. and for what it's worth, i'll just say again that you are not your grades.

** i feel like there's increased awareness about mental health, but i've personally yet to see a reduction in stigma. as someone with anxiety disorder and attention deficit disorder, i just wanna say i have gone thru years of school carrying mental disorders on my shoulders and my heart aches for u guys. i've seen judgment and i've seen a severe lack of understanding from teachers and classmates about this kinda thing. :( i'm also here to say that if you have a mental condition that affects your ability to concentrate in any way, don't let judgment from peers hinder you from getting the help u need, applying for the extra time that you need. those who judge you will never make for bosom friends.**

please talk to me if you need!! i too love the idea of a space where you won't be judged even a little. also feel free to lmk if you've had similar experiences or need help or need someone to rant to or talk to. legit hmu :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ii4b6t/rant_to_the_one_struggling_with_mental_health_and/,True,2020-08-29 02:00:10
75,"[JC] Advice for Junior College, from a graduated senior","Hey SGExams!

JAE choice submission is over, and in a few short days, you guys will be starting fresh in a new school. With that comes an influx of posts looking for advice from the ""seasoned veterans"" (a.k.a. seniors) on how to survive JC. So I'm here to give my input on this subject. Buckle up, because it's quite a lengthy read.

&#x200B;

**Why should you fully, 100% trust me?**

Here's the thing: you shouldn't. Everyone is different, and not everything that works for me, works for you. But at the same time, that means that not everything the school prescribes to you, or your friends tell you, will help you cope with the rigours of JC. Please don't force-fit yourself into any ""studying method"" or model. I'm just here to share with you mine. I can't flaunt my A-Level rank point yet, because I don't even have it back. (I can edit this post when I get it back.) But not every 90rp student gives good advice, and not every 70rp gives bad advice, so just keep an open mind.

Ready?

Let's go.

&#x200B;

* **Identify your goals for your JC experience, and work towards achieving them.**

Y'all, not everyone has the same goals in life. It's much easier to know what you want out of JC, and then intentionally direct your JC journey to fulfill these goals. If you're an aspiring med student, by all means - work your ass off to get all As. Not only is this one of the considerations for med school admissions, but it also develops good study habits for your future med school mugging. Other than that, don't forget to be involved in the community through hospital volunteering and VIA projects. If you are truly interested in helping people/working in a hospital environment, these are things you would be excited to do. (If you find it a chore, then at least you know maybe med school is not for you.) If you're an aspiring FASS student, look at the IGP. The 10th percentile of ALP is 75. All you have to do is meet those requirements, and you're in! If mugging to get that A really isn't your thing, that's okay. Forget the pressure of other people telling you your grades must be perfect. They just have to be good enough to pursue your goals.

You only have 24 hours every day. Optimise your mugging for whatever you want to do, and use the other time to pursue other hobbies or just stone and relax. Every time you study to raise a grade from a B to an A, you're sacrificing a lot of time and effort that can be spent on activities outside of the curriculum.

So maybe take some time to think about what you would like to do, or where you would like to be after JC. If you want to get a scholarship to reduce financial burden, you know what you have to do (read: mug pls). If you want to get into FASS, don't be so stressed about a B. Use that time to participate in CCAs, or do humanities research and further your interest. That means more than the first letter of the alphabet printed on your transcript.

&#x200B;

* **DON'T FALL BEHIND ON YOUR CLASSES**

How do you study, using as little effort for as much results as possible? I'm not one of the truly talented people who can just walk into the exam without studying and get an A. But I also don't mug like crazy when it comes to exam time. That's because I follow the golden rule:

>Never fall behind on your classes. - Albert Einstein

Seriously. The amount of effort required to catch up in class is infinitely more than it takes to just have paid attention in the first place. Here's why.

Let's the current math topic is Differentiation. They're teaching content in lectures, and your math tutor is going through tutorial questions in the tutorial. If you sleep during the lectures, you have no idea what's going on during the tutorial. Then let's say the next topic is Applications of Differentiation. GG bro. You don't have the help of the math tutor consolidating the info in your head every 2 days, so spaced repetition is difficult. But not only that, if you want to focus on catching up on Differentiation, by the time you understand it, the teachers already finished Applications of Differentiation. So you have to catch up again. Time and time again people keep doing this, and I really don't understand why. It's so much easier to go through work with the guidance of your tutor.

This is a simple optimisation problem. You're forced to be in school until the end of the day. You can either spend that time focusing in class and knocking out your homework, or you can have lousy slacking with shitty school wifi while confined in school gates. I personally like my slacking to include high speed internet for gaming and Netflix streaming. Lousy slacking isn't as restful as quality slacking, and when you leave your work to the last minute, you're spending the same amount of time mugging it right before your exam. (btw after you finish mugging it and take the exam, guarantee once you walk out you forget everything already.) So please, just do your homework. That's better than any last minute mugging you can pull from your ass. If you fall behind, make sure you catch up *by the same week.* **Don't be afraid to consult your teachers, they're literally paid to help you**. Are you afraid because your teacher is an arse? Consult another teacher. The school has so much experience in scheduling the right amount of time for each topic; just stick to it.

&#x200B;

* **Study smart**

Okay, so in order to not fall behind on your classes, you need to study right? But studying sucks. I know. So how can you get as much info coded into your brain sponge in as little time as possible? It's a 3 step process.

1. Read the concept, and UNDERSTAND it. Don't bother practicing questions before you know step by step *how* to do it, and more crucially, *what each step means.* Some of you guys may think the last part is pointless, but that's the difference between being able to solve the weird Cambridge questions and not even understanding it. That's the difference between people who know how to solve the Rubiks cube and speedcubers. Anyone can go online and memorise the surefire formula to solve the cube, but speedcubers actually understand what they're doing, which makes them so much more flexible and efficient. You want to be the speedcuber of the subject.
2. Do some practice questions. Read the questions carefully, and think through how you want to solve it. Don't rush at first, you will be pretty slow, but try to puzzle through it yourself. *Do not look at the answers.* That's just cheating yourself.
3. Most important step, *mark your questions, and ask yourself why you made each mistake.* As long as you thought the questions through carefully, every mistake you see has an underlying misconception. Don't give yourself the crappy ""careless"" excuse. If you're truly careless, then good. You only made 1 or 2 mistakes. But don't say everything all wrong because everything is careless. If that's the case, you shouldn't even be studying. Go take a nap or something.

Studying smart means you use every mistake as an opportunity to learn. Sometimes I see people spending hours on doing tutorial and then they never even check the answers. You think all that mental muscle memory is good, until you realise you memorised the formula wrong or assumed commutative property or whatever, and half your questions are wrong. You already spent ages doing the questions, please just check the number at the end. It takes like, 10 minutes.

As you get better, you should be doing timed practices. Do not go into an exam without having done an exam condition timed practice first. It's like practicing for 2.4 by running 2.4km untimed, on slippery floor. You need at least one session of the real deal, so your mental will be ready on exam day. Otherwise halfway through you'll realise that you were writing too slow or you don't like your pen or whatever. (true story, only finished 10 mark essay in econs lecture test lol)

On that note, don't jump to the conclusion that you need tuition too early. If you know you're scoring poorly because you didn't study, don't bother with tuition. It's a massive waste of money. If you can identify your mistakes in preparation for the exam, that's actually more effective than most tuition centers out there. For example, I got a U for my math lecture test in JC1. But that's okay, because I can identify the problem: too much time partying too little time studying. So I can fix that. I did my first math tutorial 3 months after it was due, so I know I screwed up there. **It's okay to mess up, but diagnose your mistake and change your behaviour.**

&#x200B;

* **Special mention for PW, the subject that screwed me: take it seriously**

Just don't fuck around. Try to keep to a regular timeline. Have weekly check-ins, even during exam period. It may seem like nothing in the face of common tests or promos, but when those end you'll be scrambling for time. I spent so much time and effort and emotional stability on this damn subject, you don't have to be like me.

This subject is more like real life than any other subject in JC. You're working with a group in order to solve a real world problem. So you're going to learn a lot of real world skills, like how to bullshit your Written Report, come up with a Response To Question that is completely fabricated in a minute, and most importantly, *how to work well with others*. Please be nice to your groupmates, and don't come in with any preconceived notions or whatever. You're supposed to be working together, not against each other. People are going to say dumb things a lot of the time. But guess what? You're saying loads of dumb things too. PW just brings out the smoker in all of us. So be nice.

&#x200B;

* **Finally, have fun lah**

If you're still reading this, I'm surprised you've made it this far. I'm expecting most people to just give up halfway actually. But that means that maybe you're pretty anxious about this whole JC thing. You don't have to be. JC has such a terrible reputation as being the hardest you will ever have to mug or whatever. I don't know if that's true, but I know that it won't feel like an endless grind. Because you'll be busy participating in CCAs, VIA/OVIA, other external programmes like research, hanging out with friends, etc. So focus on your core, and what you like to do. Don't do CCA or VIA for portfolio. Unless you're aspiring med or law student, that's not necessary at all, and sets you up for a life of doing stuff you hate because ""it's prestigious"". There will be shitty times when the school library is the background of your hangouts with friends, or when the stack of work you have to get through is literally half your height (don't worry it was just topic by topic review), but you'll also have the opportunity to use the school's dollar bills, connections and other resources to pursue your interests. You also have the chance to make new friends all the time: your OG, class, CCA, random people you meet at events and programmes, friends of your friends. All you have to do is strike up a conversation or invite them to do something with you.

&#x200B;

As I mentioned before, not all the advice I give will work for you. But that's the beauty of having an active and functional brain. You can do the adjustment and pick and choose how you study well. If my advice doesn't work, throw it out of your brain immediately. (I won't be offended...maybe.) This is all about **your** educational journey and **your** personal preferences.

Either way, just put your best foot forward. You don't have to like studying, or know what you want to do, or have anything figured out actually. You're 16 (or 17). A levels is not the end of the world (fortunately, because I remain alive). So put in the right amount of effort to make yourself satisfied and proud, and don't let anyone else tell you that that's too much, or not enough.

Good luck with your JAE results! If you have any other questions, feel free to comment. :)

&#x200B;

\[EDIT: ALSO, **ENJOY ORIENTATION AND THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF SCHOOL**. Do not start studying. Please. Lecture test results weigh NOTHING. Make friends and have fun. Mental state > 3 more weeks to study. There is a time too early to start studying for As and that is orientation.\]",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/exity2/jc_advice_for_junior_college_from_a_graduated/,True,2020-02-02 20:20:38
76,"[Rant] [O levels] Same ol vicious cycle, long post","Background: I took a year off to get my head straight after going through more than 3 years of living hell in sec school.

I never liked my secondary school. From the first day, the buildings just seemed to give off evil aura. My head just felt that something wasn't right, something bad was going to happen. A gut feel, as I would say. But, nothing happened. So I couldn't do anything but to wait like a sitting duck to what's to happen. In hindsight, I wished I had listened to my own gut feeling and transfered AWAY from the school. Hindsight always give you a 20/20 view, as they say.

It started with the small things, friends backstabbing. That's how I started secondary 2. Certain friend, who I shall refer her as W, wasn't happy that I was sitting with another friend in class, so she complained to the teacher, told her I was 'bullying' her. Forced me to go thru 'mediation' until my mother had it and told the teachers to 'fuck themselves' in a politically correct manner.

W and I patched, but that's not the end of the story. I had quit my former CCA, and joined scouts. W also did that too, so we ended up as CCA mates. I was... uncomfortable... so I just avoided her. W was the one who initiated the conversation, I just rode along. Hindsight again, I wished I had better taste in friends.

Scouts, oh darned scouts. That's when I met T, the 'golden' boy and fellow member of the CCA I was attending. Yet again it started with the small things, like him catcalling and him making all sorts of lewd comments about my body. I didn't think of much, as what the teachers said, 'boys will be boys.' 

I soon quit scouts due to even more drama brought indirectly by W. In my 'resignation' letter, I wrote about what W's friend did, as well as what T said. Yet again being the foolish sec 2, I didn't 'capture evidence' and just handed the resignation letter as it is.

It soon progresses into 'accidentally' or should I say, planned 'accidents'. Once brush, close an eye. Twice touch, it's a lie. I didn't know how to approach it. I don't have evidence, or even one witness. I chose to remain silent, which is something I still regret to this day. 

I started with a goal in mind for secondary 3. To get my 2 CCA points, clock as much volunteer hours and maintain at least As and Bs overall. Hah, as if I could achieve such godly goals.

Then, the opportunity came. The scouts teacher, Miss T, persuaded me to return, in exchange for a leadership position, in her words 'I guarantee you 2 points'. I bit onto her bait hard, like a trusting moron. I told her about what T tried to do to me in sec 2, because I trusted her. She told me she'll settle it.

She never did. 

The smaller problems snowballed from just words to action. T starts with random touches up the forbidden area. I couldn't scream for help, cause my voice just drowned out in a crowded canteen. The irony, I know.

It happened in broad daylight again, this time in front of my class. He rubbed possible human reproduction material onto my skirt. I went speechless. I... I didn't know how to react.

I, yet again, chose to be silent. Instead, I laughed away my sorrows with another mutual friend met thru W, I shall refer to him as J. Everytime I chased him around, and vice versa, I just forgot all about what happened. All the teasing and fun times. That was probably the reason why I didn't go insane.

Everytime it happened, I chose to stay silent. Because I believed that the scouts teacher would do something, she kept on promising and promising. Nothing ever happened.

T got bolder and bolder, the final time getting his group of friends to corner me in the canteen whilst I was queuing. T whispered in my ear, 'something something about my pantak (ass),' I didn't fully understand what he was saying, but knew he was talking about my body. All 6 of his friends took turns grabbing, until I snapped and slapped one of them before storming off. I had it. I no longer wanted to wait for promises that were never fulfilled. I decided it was time to escalate.

The final straw that broke the camel's back.

On the day I was supposed to tell the other scouts teacher, Miss L, about what T had been doing to me, I found out that Miss T had been making empty promises to keep me in the CCA. Remember she promised all sorts of 'positions' that'll guarantee my CCA points? That was a lie. Guess who they gave my promised position to? T. The golden boy. I wouldn't be so mad (maybe betrayed at most) had T regularly attended CCA. Fuck, no. He didn't even turn up for a single session the entire of sec 3. This sent me into pure hysterics, sobs and questions.

Why. What did I do wrong. What did T do to make he worthy of that position. Where did I go wrong. Why.

I sat on the staircase, sobbing and pretty much hugging the only emotional pillar I had, the railings. W and J came, W just stood there emotionless (she also didn't get a leadership position, expected, due to her attendance and attitude to scouts) whilst J tried to comfort me. It didn't help.

All the shit I endured. All the hours I poured into this CCA, the money I lost when I chose to forgo my holiday for a CCA camp that'll increase my chances of the leadership position. All the hours after session I spent practising on footdrills. The weekends I burnt memorizing drill commands.

I realized I only endured the harassment because of my ambition. My selfish goals. I didn't care about the price I had to pay, I only gave a shit about scouts, and my CCA points. I paid the final price with my sanity.

With my sanity slipping away, my only train of thoughts was to seek justice for myself. What I had lost, what another girl could have experienced because I chose to stay silent for the sake of my petty ambitions.

I approached Miss L, and told her everything that T had done. She was shocked, and asked me in chinese, when it happened. Just like what happened with Miss T, Miss L never did anything. They promised, yet nothing happened.

The mental abuse from my Chinese teacher truly broke the camel's back. Call it an unorthodox method of punishment or abuse, its up to your judgement. I was falling back on my homework because I spent every night in bed crying. As such, the Chinese teacher began confiscating my ezlink card and handphone. I was paying adult fare on a kids budget. There was even one time I had to BEG from a random stranger at a terminal for 1 dollar because I didn't have enough money. 

This pretty much pushed me to the edge. I stayed up for 72 hours (skipped school, got an MC) and finished every single essay I owed to her. On that Friday (remember it clear as day), I handed everything I owed to her. She said she'll return my belongings on Monday. Comes Monday, the chinese teacher claims I did NOT submit any essay to her despite having the class remind her that I did. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday passed. She found all my essays except one. She then claims I didn't write it, and CONFISCATES my entire SCHOOL BAG, and threatens to confiscate my uniform if I don't hand it by Friday. I was left carrying a thick stack of textbook, semi-sobbing before finally breaking down to my mother.

My mother then promptly writes into the school (at this point she doesn't know about the harassment), demanding that the teacher returns my belonging and compensate me for my adult fare. The vice principal made her return every item she took from me, and made sure she didn't dare to pull another stunt like that again. Lo and behold, she lost my spare ezlink card. So she just handed me another random NETS credit card card that doesn't belong me and told me to '闭你狗嘴' (shut my f*cking mouth) and don't complain.

I ended up flunking every single sec 3 finals, and only passing bare minimum to get me promoted. First time failing in my life. Still feels surreal till this day.

A TL;DR of what happened in 2019/2020 (idw go into details, not ready yet heh), start of sec 4: Searched for transfers, a school is willing to take me in provided the principal approves. The sperm donor (father) doesn't believe me even after I have a c** stained skirt as evidence. School pretends to 'investigate' case to lure me back to school. Both scouts teachers pretended as if I never told them about what happened, the CCA department 'mysterious' lost my resignation letter back in sec 2 that clearly stated what T had been doing. Principal traps me with other friend W (she was also looking for school to transfer) in a white room for more than 10 hours, starts interrogating both as if we committed some big crime. Starts yelling and told me 'it's a form of love to be stalked and touched' after I revealed that T stalked me outside of school (briefly mentioned to both scouts teachers). Makes W break down, fail to make me cry because I had already cut myself emotionally off. Yells again until she probably went out of breath before sending both out. Whilst all these yelling, I had recorded her actual meltdown and was planning to use it as evidence. W sabotages my plan (didn't know at that time), told the principal that I was recording her. Phone got forcefully searched, recording got deleted. School pretends to investigate the harassment case, a few witnesses step forward but was silenced off. Even HEARD the DM told another former scout member to stay silent about the harassment if he wants to keep his leadership position. Was forced to join another CCA, threatened to call the police on me if I refused to join. Placed in the middle of a class full of strangers, freaked out when one of them (later learnt it was an autistic kid, wished I hadn't publicly freaked out) came running at me at full speed and had a huge meltdown.

A rough summary of the 'traumatic' parts, without the gross details. Because I chose to come forward, the principal started targeting me. I was given a poor conduct grade despite never having any discipline/criminal case. My grades were 'modified', where I never passed again. I was forcefully placed into basic Chinese just because I failed in one test.

Thankfully, I managed to fought my way back to normal chinese. Luckily I had taken HCL back in PSLE and scored pretty much straight As in lower sec, or else I might have ended up permanently in basic Chinese and that'll screw my L1R4 score.

At this point, W was still my friend. My mother hated her. She apparently caught W in a lie: W claimed that she never did a mental assessment at IMH. In my mother's conversation with the principal, she was told W had gone to IMH, had a mental assessment, went up to the superintendent with this report and tried to transfer.

I was in denial. I started noticing things that were obvious red flags, emails between W's mother and the principal that had my name and J's, her mutual and only friend other than me. It then hit me, W will do anything and everything to get out of this school, even if it cost me.

Yet again, another few more weeks of crying and denial. I still remained W's friend, because I didn't want to believe she was capable of such backstabbing. I should have just unfriended her. If she can backstab me in sec 2, what is one more time?

In Science class, J and I started becoming closer. Occasionally we would talk and fool around. I started looking forward to Mondays and Wednesdays, because that's the days I actually had real company, away from my backstabbing horror of a class and W. We remained a row apart, because I never wanted to sit anywhere close to anybody after what had happened.

July. I remember this day as clear as day. After morning form teacher class, all the tables were joined back but they were short of my pair of table. So I sat on the left side of J's table. He just looked, I just looked. Nothing happened, I continued scribbling notes (kept on having flashbacks of what happened) and used my paper cutter to repeatedly slice the top of my paper. J asked if I was okay. Internally, I was a mess. On the outside, I just said yeah.

A friendship bloomed, only waiting for the flower to wither and die.

Over the next few weeks, I started becoming more and more paranoid. I enjoyed the company of J in class, but wondered if he was just my friend to seek out information like W. Yet, I still remained somewhat close.

I never fully trusted J, which is probably the reason why this friendship started to fall apart. I tried really, really, really hard to tell J what exactly happened in scouts but never did. It's just a gapping hole of trust that was broken that stopped me from trusting anyone again. I even forced myself to sit at the staircase he collects his lunch everyday, hoping one day I can finally tell him the truth. I never did.

Eventually I believe he heard half truths from the person that I had the most trust from, W. I only knew that W went around telling EVERYBODY about what happened in scouts when one of my acquaintance accidentally blurted out T's name and the skirt, which is only known to W, the school and I.

It was the date of MTL result release. I pretty much flew into a rage, almost punching W if I had one strand of self control less in me. After that, I just shut down and had a massive breakdown in a random unoccupied classroom.

Not even my MTL results made my day any better. By hook or crook I had passed. On a normal day I would have felt happy. Now, I was just murky on the inside and outside.

The rest of the year passed in a blur. Ever since that day, I had shut down emotionally and mentally. I distanced myself from J, and pretty much everybody. Nobody could hurt me anymore if I don't feel any pain, and that's what I did. Eventually J and I drifted, we sat for our O levels and left the school, leaving too many unspoken words between us.

The current

Mentally, I'm still exhausted because of my chaotic home environment. The sperm donor makes my life a living hell. Emotionally, I still don't feel things. I simply don't trust anymore, so I can't get hurt again. The closest I've came to feeling something was when I heard from my former classmates that T had touched another girl inappropriately. The only feeling I had was pain. If only I had spoken earlier that other girl wouldn't have gone thru what I had.

Part of me is looking forward to poly, yet my paranoid side tells me that the past will come back and haunt me. Yes, I'm worried that I will lose out opportunities because of what the evil principal had done to me (bad conduct grade). I used to get nightmares that W would be in the same course as I am. I'm scared that I'll trust the wrong friends, and see history repeat itself again.

I've been living as if I were dead for 2 years. I think it's time for me to open up and be a functioning human again. I think this post pretty much marks the end of me re-living everyday in this nightmare. It's time to let go. 

*A small message to J, whether you're reading this or not: I'm thankful that we met in sec sch, although it was in shit circumstances. I'm sorry for not trusting you. Thank you for leaving me with at least 1 good memory of sec sch. Also, I'm sorry that I slapped you. I wish I wasn't sensitive, I wish at that time I had known you weren't the bad guy. I wish my paranoia hadn't killed this friendship. I hope you're doing well wherever you are.*

Tysm for listening to my rant. It's just June and reality is hitting me. In around 8 months it'll be the end of my mental break year and it's time for me to face my biggest fears, trusting and people.

77,[Uni] The situation with UK's A level results U-turn.,"I saw a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ibr76b/uni_for_those_of_you_who_are_planning_to_apply_to/) on this subreddit a few hours ago, and I would like to offer what I know and my perspective regarding the whole situation. As a disclaimer, even though I am studying in the UK, I don’t claim to know everything about the system. Feel free to point out any inaccuracies in my post.

**1. Context**

The biggest difference between Singapore and UK’s uni admission system (using A level results) is its timing and the use of *predicted* grades.

In Singapore, students take their A levels during November – December 2019. Results are out the following year in February 2020. Students apply to universities with their *actual* grades by April 2020, and if accepted, they start school in August 2020. All in all, there is an approximately nine-month period between sitting for their A levels (in 2019) and starting uni (in 2020).

In UK, students looking to start university in September 2020 will have to apply by January 2020; certain courses like medicine have an earlier deadline in October 2019. However, as of January 2020, these students would not have sat for their A levels, which would be in May – June 2020. As such, they would apply using *predicted* grades. Their actual results will only be released in August 2020 (aka now).

Based on predicted grades, unis may have one of three responses: (1) conditional offer; (2) unconditional offer; (3) no offer (rejection). A conditional offer would mean that the student’s predicted grades were slightly below the required grades for that course, however the uni is willing to give the student a chance by waiting for their actual results. If their actual results meet whatever grades were required, they will be accepted into the uni (provided the student chose the uni as well). An unconditional offer means that the uni is satisfied, on the basis of the student’s predicted grades alone, and is willing to take in the student. In such cases, their actual grades do not matter anymore.

**2. What changed?**

Then coronavirus struck the UK (and everywhere). School was cancelled and GCSE (O levels) and A levels could not take place. However, something still had to be offered to students who have applied to university, especially the ones who received conditional offers. 

When A level results were released, nearly a third of pupils saw their ‘actual’ grades drop by at least a grade, as compared to their predicted grades. For those with conditional offers, this meant that some students would not have met the conditions, and thus had to settle for their second or third choice. At the same time, other students saw their grades increase.

The reason behind the grade shift was the use of an algorithm that also takes into account the school’s past performance, and adjusting individual students’ grades from there. As the other post pointed out, the aim of this algorithm was to prevent grade inflation, where teachers may predict excessively high grades for their students, resulting in many more students getting A or A\*.

**3. Fairness of the system**

Following results release, many students took to the streets to protest against the use of the algorithm and called for the education minister to step down. Their main complaint was that the system unfairly disadvantaged students from poorer backgrounds (and attended state school), whilst those from more affluent backgrounds (and attended private school) were given a boost in the results.

To put it in the local context, imagine two students: student 1 is from a top-tier JC and was predicted to get D grades; student 2 is from a bottom-tier JC and was predicted to get A grades. Because of their grades, student 1 applied to courses with lower cut-offs, whilst student 2 was encouraged to apply to a competitive course (e.g. medicine) and received a conditional offer (to get A grades as predicted).

Upon results release, student 1’s grades got boosted to C thanks to his JC’s standing whilst student 2’s grades were downgraded to B, also because of his JC. As a result, student 1 is now able to apply for other courses which he previously couldn’t have, thanks to the higher than expected grades. On the contrary, student 2 is now no longer eligible for medicine as he did not get the A grade which the uni wanted.

The difference between top JCs in Singapore and private schools in UK is that for the latter, money is a much larger and more direct barrier. Whilst one could say that Singaporean students from affluent backgrounds have more ease in entering top JCs (due to increased opportunities for talent development, academic assistance etc), there is a much more direct connection to money for the UK’s private schools (in terms of fees). And because UK’s private schools are highly selective, they take in students that they know will score well (and whose parents can afford the school fees). So in terms of ‘past performance’, there exists a virtuous circle for that school, where they will always do better (as a whole) than many other schools.

Whilst the issue of grade inflation is a valid one, I can’t agree that the algorithm is ‘fair’, since it disproportionately affects students from less well-off backgrounds. Not forgetting that these students would likely have worked hard (in spite of the environment they grew up in or the school they attended) and was on track to get into a competitive course of their dreams. However, because of the algorithm, their hopes and dreams were dashed – and for them the meritocratic principle of ‘work hard and you will succeed’ rings hollow.

**4. Impact on international students**

The post suggests that due to the ‘grade inflation’, competition would be tougher for international students. 

It is true that, at the moment, there is quite a bit of confusion and chaos thanks to the U-turn, and students who have missed out on offers are now trying to see if they can get back their original conditional offers. Prior to the U-turn, two of Cambridge’s colleges have in fact honoured their offers to students as they felt sufficiently confident in their admissions process, never mind their ‘algorithm grades’. However, not all unis are able to do so; some have suggested that they would honour their conditional offer, but for the subsequent academic year, as the current year’s spots were all filled by those with ‘algorithm grades’ who met the cut-off.

That being said, I personally don’t think this will have a huge impact on the number of international students. For one, each university (and course) has a certain quota on international students. No matter how UK student number fluctuate, I don’t believe the quota will be affected significantly.

From a more cynical point of view, international students are cash cows to universities. Local students pay £9250 of tuition fees per year, regardless of course. However, international students typically pay twice that amount (£18000) for most courses (e.g. business), while courses like medicine see them paying at least £30000 per year. An international student is thus ‘worth’ 2 – 5 times of a local student.

So, from a money standpoint, universities would love to have the same number (or even more) of international students to study with them. It is unlikely that any university will be willing to reduce their international student numbers, unless they are forcefully mandated by the government. However, I have not heard of such instructions so far, and I also believe it is equally unlikely that the government will step in in this manner.

Not forgetting that the pandemic has also caused universities to lose international students: some may opt to stay in their home country (due to concerns over the virus in UK); some may be in tough financial situation and can no longer afford to study in the UK. Also, current tensions between China and UK may see a reduced number of China students in UK universities. In 2018/19, 32% of first-year international students were from China. Whilst it might be too early to predict how bad the fallout may be, I’m sure universities are more than happy to accept international students from other countries to fill the gap of China students.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iby5ah/uni_the_situation_with_uks_a_level_results_uturn/,True,2020-08-19 02:01:34
78,[A levels] Animal encounter during Chem P3,"H1 Econs is over wooooo!!! I decided to take this lil break before physics to share a story of how I got into this situation during chem paper 3 yesterday. There was no animal in the paper itself (except the MEAT), and the paper was ok thankfully, it was just that time is and will forever be my enemy. Actually, when I entered the classroom I already thought it would be a recipe for disaster. If you've made an acute observation of my account, then you would know my school, and we would sometimes be called the Botanical Gardens of the East. This just means that there's a lot of plants and also plenty of WILDLIFE. And it just so happens that the exam room was a dirty ass classroom providing a sanctuary for pests.

So I was rushing through my qn 5 trying to draw the structures for T and U. The teacher stands up from her chair and announces that there are 15 minutes left. Anxiety kicks in. I was trying to copy the structures from the previous page, quite annoyed that I had to flip over repeatedly. That's when I saw it. From my peripheral vision, I saw a creature crawling on the floor. It was crawling towards the person on my left. *Haha* I thought to myself, as I continued to do my work, boy little did I know karma will strike me soon. As I flipped the page over for the umpteenth time, I realised the creature was moving towards ME. I took a careful look at it. It was a lizard, a small one to be fair, but I hate these things. I was already stressed out trying to finish my paper on time and now this lizard was crawling towards my leg. 

For about 3 minutes, my eyes were fixated on this thing. I stomped my foot softly to warn the pest. Any rational creature would turn around and flee. But this was no rational lizard. Not only was it slow, it was crawling funny too. Was drunk or something I swear. Don't say I never warn you ah Mr. Lizard, I'm gonna kick you to fly away. Once he entered the proximity of my table I dragged my foot to kick it, trying to make as less noise as possible. Luckily nobody noticed. Unfortunately for Mr. Lizard, he was left motionless on the floor, separated by his tail. I swear it was a soft kick, and yet he died. RIP man, dedicated my last few min of the paper to his funeral. Initially I thought he was playing possum but sure enough even after the paper was collected he was still there. I managed to take a [photo](https://imgur.com/a/7R1cdoS) before leaving the exam centre. Anyway, my friend had a spider on his exam table during Maths.

hi guys! i've posted my ss srq notes before prelims so that anyone could use them if anyone needed to. as tomorrow's our actual ss paper, i thought i'd post them again so that those who haven't seen them can find them easily (and hopefully the notes will help y'all even though there's only one day left). i did not include the links and conclusions to the different points since everyone's pov and explanation is different due to our own interpretation, and it also depends on the question requirement of the qn that comes out for tmr. but generally the notes contain the essence of all the content with the important points highlighted. i cut down info as much as i could so that it wouldn't be as difficult to revise compared to using the textbook. i always score 7/8 for srq (b) and i refer to these notes so i think they should be fine. ALL THE BEST EVERYONE!!!!

Schooling days are super precious and really can be the golden period of our lives, so please do not give yourself too much stress because of studies. Enjoy life, play hard, make good memories! 

There is really a long way to go in life, and you may think that results are everything now but years down the road all these will not matter! Your exam results will NOT define the rest of your life.

85,[RANT] i think my school is going way overboard with their demerit system,"im a student from MGSsec and recently there’s been a lot of people including my close friends who have been booked for reasons that i find are very unfair, and at a very excessive rate. 

in the school, we are given until a max of 9 demerit points until we are given detention and a fair conduct grade. swearing counts as 3 demerits each time. i’m not sure about most schools out there, but i heard that in one catholic school, swearing is only 1 demerit, which is equivalent to getting booked for appearance (eg. not cutting nails, hair not tied properly). 

while this has always been the case in our school for as long as i can remember (i came from mgpri and the rules in mgsec apply to there as well), this year the school has been getting stricter and stricter with their rules even outside of the school compound. students are getting booked for posting cuss words like f word and b word to their private instagram posts and stories, or sometimes even their whatsapp status. even with the current circuit breaker situation, there have been students who have been given demerits because they shared a post that contained a vulgarity, like a meme, or a screenshot of a chat posted to their story which contains a vulgarity. 

i happened to hear through mutual friends that a student in the school was awarded a total of 9 demerit points due to posting swear words on her instagram and her whatsapp, all during this circuit breaker period. she was reported by her friends who were prefects and reported these screenshots to the school. don’t you find such a case unfair? 

our school always taught us to love one another, “love your neighbour as yourself”. yet we have prefects who turn their backs on their friends by reporting them to the teachers? furthermore, the school has sent out an email not too long ago regarding this vulgarity issue, as apparently many students had been booked that month for use of vulgar language. in the email, they wrote that they were aware of the prefects or even friends who had reported these students to the school, and they wrote and i quote: “to those who choose not to indulge in vulgarity, we are very proud and thankful for your choice. we are also proud and thankful to those who after reading this, will be intentional in making a choice to live out their lives without profanity and instead, choose to speak with discernment and respect.”

to me, i find it beyond unfair that the school takes measures like these. if a student was to say vulgarities in the school or within school compounds, sure! they do deserve demerits. but to think that even while at home, we are unable to post what we want on social media without the fear or getting reported out of nowhere? now many of my schoolmates have said that they are paranoid and when in group chats involving friends who are only close to a certain extent (say, deskmates, classmates, friends from other classes), they have to control their emotions and their words and can’t speak as freely as they used to, all in the fear of getting backstabbed by someone they are messaging. who would have thought that a student could even get booked from home? is it really worth giving a student that “fair” or even “poor” grade over trivial things such as these?

furthermore, there have been many students in the school falling into depression, some even suicidal. around two or three years ago, there was a rumour circulated around the school that a sec 2 student had even attempted suicide, but nothing was said about the school and nobody knows what happened to the girl afterwards. yet, in my opinion, the school decides to put more time, effort and emphasis over a student’s language use even outside of school, just to maintain this “image of an MGS girl” that they strive so hard to achieve, rather than caring about more pressing issues such as these, which just makes me ask myself, why?

while this is just my personal opinion, i feel that something is definitely wrong about this situation and would like to ask a bigger other students about their opinions on this

86,[Uni] I regret everything,"Yes, I was a 90-RPer. Yes, I am a scholarship holder (with no bond). Yes, I could have chosen literally any local uni course I wanted and most except Med/Law/Dent would have accepted me.

My parents, JC teachers, friends, etc all reacted with shock when I said I wanted to do an engineering course. “Really? Don’t waste your 90 RP! 90 RP why not try something more prestigious! Such a waste for 90 RP to go engineering!” were things that I heard almost daily if not weekly. But I wanted to do it because I know I’m a more hands-on person and enjoy maths (despite being absolute trash at it).

GP and Econs were my best subjects. I did well in them without even trying that hard, and I struggled with my science subjects (phys, chem, maths). And yet, guess what. I entered an engineering course, the literal opposite of what someone in my position would logically have done. 

Now, 3 years into this Bachelor of Engineering degree, I regret everything. I regret not listening to everyone who told me to choose something like Business or Economics. I’m so shit at this degree, I don’t even know how I’m going to find a job when I graduate.

Mentally, I’m finished. I hate how much I suck at doing engineering. The only reasons why I haven’t dropped out yet:

- Scholarship, cannot afford liquidated damages if I drop out

- I’m already 3 years in and I can’t change major anymore.

- I only have a shitty A level certificate if I drop out now.

- The people in this school who have invested so much time into grooming me (because I’m a scholar) will be so disappointed if I quit.

I’m so tired of this degree. I can’t even see myself staying in this field if I graduate.

Yes, my GPA (CAP) is not *that* bad (above 4). Yes, on the surface I’m doing fine. I participate in school life, do projects on the side, research, committees, etc. But underneath all that is someone seriously struggling to keep up with subjects they have totally no aptitude for. The GPA? Mostly due to electives and non-engineering modules. The amount of time I spend on just trying to keep up in class is astounding. I sleep at 2am every day out of necessity, sit in the library for 12 hours every day during reading week, and yet, the maximum grade I’ve ever scored for an engineering mod is A-. Most of the time I get B or C. Professors love me for how hard I try, but trying hard is not enough to get a good honours class.

So yeah, I regret everything. I don’t know what the point of this post is other than that I wanted to rant a bit, but thanks for reading.

Oh yes, I know A level results come out tomorrow, and I don’t want to discourage you from engineering, as it’s a beautiful field. I still have some liking for it, I guess. But I want to say that for those taking results, please consider carefully what you choose. Don’t choose something just because you like it. I thought I liked engineering, but being so shit at the cornerstone subjects of a course does take its toll on your passion for it. Consider carefully, and don’t make the same mistake I did.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f6mi2s/uni_i_regret_everything/,True,2020-02-20 19:05:30

88,[Jobs] To all who may be thinking of working after your exams: know your rights,"As with many other people, I’ve been looking around for jobs ever since my exams ended. Seeing how this subreddit has a relatively young audience and the emergence of some posts on a similar topic, I thought that it’d be helpful for anyone else who was thinking of working after As/Os to understand more about the rights that you have as an employee. I cannot stress how important it is to know what you’re getting yourself into.

**I am not a law student or a legal professional in any way — this is simply my opinion as someone who's gone to quite a few job interviews and done some research. I highly recommend that anyone who is thinking of starting a job to spend some time reading through MOM's pages, though I have attempted to highlight (what I believe are) the most relevant and crucial bits in this post.**

**My information may not be completely accurate but I have included all the hyperlinks to the relevant MOM pages. Please let me know if I've made any errors and I'd love to hear if you have anything to add on.**

**\[1\] What is a contract?**

Simply put, a [contract](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/contract-of-service/what-is-a-contract-of-service) is something which proves that you're being employed at a certain company. It details your pay, benefits, working arrangements etc. While MOM has stated that 'the agreement can be in writing, verbal, expressed or implied', they strongly encourage that 'the contract should be in writing' to 'minimise disputes on the agreed terms and conditions'. This is super important because it's much harder to prove that you're being employed if it's on a verbal basis. Always try to get some form of written or printed confirmation of your employment before starting work.

**\[2\] Why should I care?**

Having a contract helps to ensure that you're being treated fairly by the company, ie being paid on time, be able to take sick days etc. It prevents any possible mistreatment or malpractice by your employer and helps to ensure that you're in a safe working environment. If you don't have a contract, there is pretty much no proof that you're being employed. This means that the company can technically choose to refuse certain rights, delay your payment etc as there is no binding agreement between the employee (you) and the employer, which technically makes them not entitled to provide you with the aforementioned remunerations.

**\[3\] So, what kinds of rights am I entitled to?**

**\[3A\] The Contract of Service**

The [Contract of Service](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/contract-of-service) is, for the lack of a better word, the contract mentioned in \[1\]. The page is very clear so I won't flood the details here but it basically states: (1) what it is, (2) what it entails, (3) when it has to be done by, (4) when it comes into effect.

*Edit:* [*Part-timers*](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/part-time-employment) *are defined by MOM to be employees under a Contract of Service and working* ***less than 35 hours a week***. The Contract of Service has a different (less stringent) set of requirements, the details of which can be found [*here*](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/part-time-employment/who-is-a-part-time-worker)*.*

**\[3B\] The Employment Act**

As a worker, you need to have a Contract of Service, after which you will be protected under the [Employment Act](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/employment-act/who-is-covered). The Employment Act applies if you're being employed full-time, part-time, or on a temporary or contract basis. It covers you regardless of whether you're a local or foreign worker. You are then protected under the law and are able to take action should your contract of service ever be violated.

**\[3C\] The right to complain**

Remember, if a contract isn't present, there is no binding relationship between you and the company. If you do not feel comfortable with working for them, you can always refuse.

The Contract of Service states that your employer must issue you a contract within 14 days after your first day of work. I personally called MOM to enquire about my situation and they stated that if you are working for the company and they do not issue you a contract within that time period, you are then able to [launch a complaint with MOM](https://www.mom.gov.sg/contact-us) which will be handled confidentially. In my opinion, if you're unsure about any terms of your employment, do consider calling MOM at 6438 5122 for general enquiries. The hyperlink states other means of reaching them as well (if a phone call is not possible) and other means to contact them about other issues.

90,"[Junior College] Something I needed to get off my chest for a long time, appreciate it if someone reads it","TL;DR: parents unhappy about JC choice and trying to get back at me about my choice at every possible opportunity 

Well, it’s a long story but i’ll try my best to keep it short. It all started off when I collected my O level results. I got 10-4 and was quite satisfied since i aimed between 9 and 11 raw. However, the problem starts here. My parents were very very traditionalistic and wanted me to go to NJC with that score. I said no. I went to their open house with my parents and (no offense to NJC students here) i just couldn’t click with the culture there. My parents really wanted me to go to NJC as they thought the school was the standard they were in their generation (the late 80s). I also went to NYJC’s open house and i felt that i was at home there. There was a homey feeling and i had a lot of seniors there who told me about the pros and cons of NY. On the other hand, NJC is one of the least popular options for students from my sec school, so that was another reason i didn’t want to go there, as i needed someone that i knew in the school to seek guidance from. So i ranked NY over NJ in my choices and i got into NY. This is where the shit started hitting the fan. 

My parents were against NY from the start for many reasons. Firstly, they think NY is a ‘neighbourhood JC’ with a trash track record and their standards are equal to that of the lower-end JCs. They didn’t want to see any of the achievements that NY had and they kept on harping on the fact that NJC is superior to NY and I should not consider NY. When i heard that, i was actually quite pissed. Although NY doesn’t release much of its A level results as compared to other JCs, i heard from my seniors that a large percentage of the cohort managed to score 80rp and above. I told them that and they said that it was all bullshit. Now i really don’t know if they choose not to believe or are just completely delusional. My dad was from NJC and he scored averagely as compared to my other relatives and maybe that’s why he wants me to go to NJ so badly. I couldn’t talk them over this and I decided to let it slide. well, bad mistake.

fast forward to today, 4 weeks into the term. I made many new friends and i have to say, the workload isn’t as bad as compared to other JCs. i’m taking a hybrid combi (CHEM) which isn’t offered in NJ (also why i chose NY over NJ) and my teachers are very nice. All looked good for me until yesterday.

Yesterday, my mom forwarded some fake news about covid-19 into the family group chat. It was something about diluted bleach is a good substitute for mouthwash (seriously wtf) and i told her that it was fake news. She then started scolding me saying that “oh it’s from a official news website (the site is unverified and has no SSL certificate) and who asked you to contradict me?” at that point i was done and i just said “as long as you’re happy i don’t care”. Then she starts bringing up about how NY is corrupting it’s students with its bullshit teachings and etc etc etc. after that she just gives me the silent treatment and i’m now at a loss. The fact that i chose NY over NJ is still something that she always tries to get leverage on and i really can’t stand it anymore. some other instances she used it was when i was video calling my friends to discuss some chemistry homework questions and she walked in on me saying why am i calling my friends. I said it was for homework and she started screaming at me saying that if i went to NJ the teachers would teach you well enough so that you won’t need to ask questions and you won’t need to waste time on this shit and the rant goes on. 

Well, it feels good to get it out of my system but the problem is still there. any advice for me to resolve this situation without creating more rifts between my parents and me?

Sorry if i offended any of y’all here, and if you say that i should have listened to my parents and went to NJ, i won’t mind and it gives me something to reflect on.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ferjwy/junior_college_something_i_needed_to_get_off_my/,True,2020-03-07 22:49:48
91,[A levels] It's not over!,"Hi all.

I have graduated and did my A levels many years ago - 2012 (yeah apocalypse year).

It seemed like little has changed except, every year the papers get more complicated than the previous, the amount of stress and anxiety seemed to have gone way up (or may be these days people are more willing and open to talk about things)

I have noticed that quite a few redditors were very concerned about how they have screwed up their examinations and no longer have motivation to study.

I would like to refer back to a cautionary tale of a batchmate - he's a high achiever, looking to get all As, but during his first A level paper in GP, he was so affected by sitting below the aircon with the cold wind, the nerves got to him, he underperformed, was convinced that he had done horribly for his GP. It spiraled into obsession about his first paper in GP that he was so affected during all the subsequent papers, to the point that he had a meltdown and submitted blank scripts for one of his examination papers!

The stunning thing that happened: He did poorly of course, and got a U (what do you expect if you send in blank scripts) for one of his papers, but he actually got an A for GP! I think that speaks a lot, if he had known that his ""poor performance"" has given him an A instead of think he screwed up, he would not have made it a self-fulfilling prophecy, and actually caused him to screw up the remaining papers.

It's not over until it's over guys.

I'm not sure whether this will work for y'all, but during A levels, I made a promise to myself that after each exam, I will walk out the examination hall, go straight to my bag, put on earphones and head straight home on the first train/bus. I will avoid speaking to anyone even small talk like how do you find it, which question you picked, and go straight home, avoiding the crowd so I will not overhear anything, then go straight home, take a short nap, then study for the next day's paper (and really, there isn't a lot of time to study). Definitely avoid discussion of answers. Avoid social media (yah I know how ironic this is now that y'all are here and I'm posting)

As a result, when my paper doesn't go smoothly, all I thought was ""wow that was a bit of a mess"" and that's it. It will not spiral into ""how many marks did I lose, will I still get this grade, my life is screwed"". You will have plenty of time to spiral after the final exam is done. 

To me this is just something practical because

1. I need time to study 
2. There's no use discussing answers, because if you are ""correct"" you never know for sure and if you are ""wrong"" it only demoralizes you and Cambridge never releases actual answers anyway.
3. There's little value in discussing because it's not like you will need to ""learn from it"" for a next paper (god forbid you have a next paper because if all things go well there should not be a next paper). 

All the best you lot! A levels are harsh but believe me there are more things to life that will test you beyond A levels e.g. army, jobs, separation, life/death of loved ones and friends.

93,[rant] The slow descent into apathy," Anyone here was once a curious person who was interested in many things but once you entered school you started to slowly not give a shit. That was the case for me, and it is quite sad. I really want to become the curious person I once was but I really don't have the energy for that, I just feel so tired.

It is O level's right now, and I am sooooo sick of studying the same thing over and over again it is so boring, and the thing is I don't even study much, I know classmates that are mugging everyday. I don't know how they do it.

School really sucks the drive and motivation out of you. Doing the same thing over and over again, and learning things that you don't want to learn just grinds away anything positive you have slowly. Everything is so competitive too.  For E math you have to score like 90 plus that isn't normal, like think about it NINETY!!!! Singapore educates their children thinking that all of us wants to become some nobel prize winner or some big CEO of a major company. 

I  just want to wake up at 9 and watch Doraemon again... I want the lifestyle where I can just do anything I want with no rules and no authority.  I just wanna marathon some manga or book and have fun. But cannot, cos if you are singaporean you are born to do this crap. 

The holiday after o levels is probably my last holiday... jc no break.... NS is horrible.... and after that you are an adult and you cannot watch Doraemon anymore. The future sucks to be honest.

Anyone feels the same as me?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jhtnl8/rant_the_slow_descent_into_apathy/,True,2020-10-26 05:52:15
94,[O levels] Before and during receiving O level slip advice,"I know that O level result release is 11 Jan-13 Jan approx but I felt like wanting to say this because some people are so nervous about O level results. So hi. And disclaimer, I feel like this might not be complete, especially this was from what I know SO FAR.

* Before taking the O level results,

Look up on your desired courses. Find out more abiut them. Do considered the other choices too like JC, MI, Poly and other forms of institution, especially in the case of ""if you cannot get your desired course of study"". Do also try to look up on which UNI course for those planning on univserity studies as : 

1. Some uni courses allow all diplomas but it can be HARDER for certain diplomas depending on the ""eligibility""(I put in quotes). 

E.g.(DISCLAIMER: might not be a good e.g. because I am not from poly so for those poly students, PLS CORRECT ME) Let's say I take Nanotechnology and Material Sci from NYP NMS with reference to http://nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/polytechnic-diploma-from-singapore/subject-pre-requisites/for-nanyang-polytechnic-diploma-holders and http://nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp) . 

Can he take NUS business administration or law? High chance (if he scores 3.73 for Business admin and 3.86 for Law and Business and Law is under ""All diplomas"" category, meaning all diplomas can enter.) 

Can he take Electrical Eng? High chance (if he scored 3.68 and according to the NMS category, electrical eng will most likely accept the diploma.)

Can he take NUS Medicine or Food Science as a degree? Low chances (even if he scored 4.0 for his gpa, it is not a diploma in either ""All diplomas"" or ""NMS"" category. Even till today I dont even know whether the Aptitude Based Admission will work cus I mostly heard it is for those who scored a little bit below the 10th percentile so far. Poly students pls correct me thanks.)

For diploma to NTU courses: https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/adm_appl.relevant_diploma

2. This is the same for the JC students as well. Although yes, art combi can give you a myriad of options like Business, Real Estate Humanities, NTU Sport Science and Law, an art combi may not be possible for Science, Medicine or Engineering(well depends). (Disclaimer: I am not saying art combi is horrible. Pls dont kill me) But if plan on taking a humans subject at H2, do consider Hybrid combi as well. And for those interested in business,finance,economics and accountancy, MI is a possible option even though it takes 3 years for A level degree, they are the only ones offering H2 POA and H2 Management of Business. And for those who are not aware yet, Medicine accept students with H2 Chem and H2 Phy/H2 Bio aka PC×× or BC××.

Do also consider other options if you cannot meet the desired course. E.g. Let's say you want to go to NP's Film, Sound & Video diploma with ELR2B2-D which is 8 rank points. In the case you overshot, maybe you can look at other diplomas(e.g. Infocomm and Media Eng from NYP ELR2B2-C of 24 rank points, Media Production and Design diploma or Art and Theatre Management diploma from RP of ELR2B2-A of 20 rank points or even Broadcast and Media Technology from ITE Central of ELR2B2-C of 34(aka if legit your ELR2B2 exceeds 28 pts with reference to JAE booklet not ITE intake booklet)) or JC if possible e.g. YIJC-19/20 , TMJC-13 (P.S. TMJC has H2 Theatre Studies and Drama) and MI. Do consider art institutions like NAFA and LaSalle.

And for JC students, please for the love of god choose your subjects wisely. Some subjects cannot be put tgt in certain or all JCs. Trust me when I say this because they think just because YIJC does not offer something, means all JCs don't offer. E.g. Just because YIJC does not offer a subject combi H2 FM, Computing and H2 Math tgt does NOT mean ALL JCs dont offer.(Look at JPJC). So do look out for other JCs and esp they range of subjects. Even if the JC offers this subject, pls dont choose it because its popular or is more useful ""in general but not you"" E.g. People chose PCMe even though they would rather do business/arts and not the STEM sector (Not saying it is not possible but trust me when I say H2 Chem is hard, esp organic chem well unless you are hinting at NTU Eng and Business double major).

And lastly, if you legit don't know what to do till now but feel like JC sucks and should rot in hell, some poly offer ""Common XXXX programmes"" e.g. RP Common Science Programme, all Poly Common ICT/Engineering/Business Programme which allow you take common core subjects first and then in year 2, you can choose what diploma specialisation you want to take(though not all would offer all diploma specialisations.) 

Reason I say to plan is because you are given 12 options of school/course so choose wisely and find out what sparks your passion/career.

Oh and btw, you can still go to uni with a poly diploma and some degrees do allow all diplomas. Do take note of CCA options and distance to school too.

* When you take O level results,

1. Take note of Open houses in poly/JC. Plan out how to celebrate/destress after receiving results. Trust me, your friends are the best supporters and this is a once in a lifetime chance(maybe) to see them again. Go hang out w friends by going to lunch, playing sports, chilling out, etc.

2. Prepare a set of tissues. No really. Prepare them even at home or at school with Covid. I am not saying you should cry but tbh in all O level and A level experiences, there will always be joys and tears of sorrow. So do offer anyone a pat in the back, some tissues and encouragement to those who did not make it.

3. As nervous as you are, do listen out any ""before hand"" assemblies which talks about the JAE procedure. And do take note that yes, in your JAE booklet and you flip to the last few pages, you will see scholarships like ECDA, SG:D and HomeTeam scholarships for poly diploma. (This is for those complaining about poly school fees.) 

4. If need to, do find a career counsellor if you are still lost in finding a path you want to go to. Esp those who did not make it to the dream courses. And if still dont know, just go to open houses. 

5. If your grades are private to you, it is ok to not show them. Yes, even those which are damn good one. Trust me, if you are legit not comfortable to show them and they keep pestering you, give them a middle finger.

6. Before leaving the house, be mentally prepared and make a plan B of school choices. For those who did not make it, use plan B. If plan B fails, continue searching, especially ITE diplomas, private diplomas or retaking O levels. For those who suffer from stress or mental illnesses, go and see a psychiatrist and/or call any hotlines for mental health. For those whose parents will get mad and angry and do stuff, I cannot help you but do consider your friends. Go and sleepover with them if need to and seek for help. I cant advise on this one but figure out your next plan of action.

* After receiving O level results 

1. ""Idk what CCA to choose""

There are CCA fairs and school websites do talk about ccas. And also do talk to your seniors/OGLs(Orientation grp leaders) for cca/academic advice on some ccas for more info.

2. ""I feel like I cannot make friends.""

Well honestly, it depends but the chances of you having friends will be higher if you try talking to them and hanging out with them. Do try and make peers with positive peer influence and if your attitude needs to be changed(e.g. throwing insults or being too extrovertedly scary/overwhelming), do change it accordingly. And even if you cannot make friends, friends arent really a priority conpared to academics but do make friends for the right reasons such as having someone to talk to and make life easier.

3. ""I am from JC and I want to drop to poly and vice versa""

Ok this one I legit dont know but maybe moe hotline centre can help. Someone pls do advice about this in the comments.

4. ""I regret this course. So hard....:(""

There are two options. Adjust your study schedule accordingly or drop to another course. I would not recommend dropping out but rather adjusting your study methods and holding on to the stress. As much as mental health is important, pls dont give up, especially if you are interested in this sector. For poly students, do drop out of cca if need to and for jc students, try to limit yourself to 1 CCA unless you can handle more. Eat healthily and don't sleep late. And for my JC students, do start revising early, eventually it will take shape.

Anyways, I hope this is helpful and for any mistakes, pls comment down. And I wish you best of luck for O levels and your future. As always, stay strong, stay happy and have fun post O levels.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kjg6pm/o_levels_before_and_during_receiving_o_level_slip/,True,2020-12-25 06:21:00
95,"[A Levels] Got asked to leave JC, what do I do","I entered Junior College in 2019 and took a science combi which was awful. Hated the subjects and teachers. So when I was eventually told to retain after flunking my finals spectacularly I decided to enrol in the Arts stream in 2020 where I took H2 Economics, Geography, History and H1 Math. 2 days ago I finally got my promos back and my results were S,D,S,A respectively, and a C for General Paper. Unfortunately, this meant that I did not manage to meet my JC's promotional criteria of 2 H2 passes. While I did manage to meet the advancement criteria of 1 H2 pass and 2 H2 subpasses, it is not an option that is made available to me (being a repeat student). Hence, I've been told to leave school in search of an education somewhere else.

... which puts me in this weird and frustrating spot of not really knowing what to do moving forward.

Deep down I know I would like to end up in a uni studying some form of politics but I just have no idea how to move forward from here. I'm aware that my options consist of poly and perhaps a foundation year in some private uni but I just don't know where to begin looking. I also have not told my parents about this, but I can foresee that they would be extremely disappointed in me and that months of nagging will entail.

For anyone who has made it this far and is willing to give me some advice, I should let you know that:

1. I got an L1R4 of 11 and an L1R5 of 14 for my O Levels
2. officially speaking, I can't appeal to my JC but they have made it clear that my parents can meet the principal to appeal through some sort of backchannel

Sorry if this post seems incoherent or the formatting is weird, these few days have been rough.

98,[A Levels] How to do well for A Levels: Advice from a Senior,"So im sure many of you J2s (or even J1s) are gonna start feeling the stress of the approaching A levels coming in like what? 6+ months? Im here to share some tips for doing well at the A levels, before I forget my experience (actually, idt i will ever forget this nightmare experience). Disclaimer: this is not a foolproof guide to scoring 90rp, take my words with a pinch of salt, as everyone's study methods will differ. You still have to find what works for you! These tips are general tips, not subject-specific. I took H2 BCME, if you want more subject-specific tips can pm me

Ok so 1st tip: PLEASE SLEEP! When I was in JC, my friends were always sleeping at 1am/2am (I've even heard 4am) cause they're mugging away the whole night. Last time I thought I was pretty productive at night, cause no one to talk to me and I won't get distracted. There was once I slept at 3am I felt so damn productive I got so much done, but I was exhausted. I went to sleep, the next day I woke up, I forgot everything I studied last night. Not a good idea as I essentially wasted so many hours when I could have slept at 11pm, woke up early and fresh the next day to study which will allow me to retain more information. So in JC, I made it a point to sleep by 11pm, 11.30pm the latest (apart from PW days that one no choice must sleep late to rush deadlines). I seldom fell asleep during lectures (except for Statistics lectures for H2 math oops) while my friends kept dozing off, then must take time to rewatch lectures again. That was 1 major factor i think contributed to my performance. During A level period (like during the actual exam days), I took a nap immediately when I came home from the paper. Maybe around 30mins (not over 1 hr though, u will wake up groggy and you wont feel like doing anything). Then I will study for my next paper. So power naps are actually not a waste of time, they can make you more productive.

2nd Tip: PLEASE ASK QUESTIONS! No time to be shy in JC. It's your own loss if you don't ask when you're not sure cause you're scared your classmates/ teachers will judge you for asking a 'stupid' question. Trust me, your classmates will thank you instead. At first, I was also damm shy, didn't dare to ask questions. But I saw my J1 promo grades, oh boy I had to change. Sometimes I would ask questions in class, but most of the time I will ask questions immediately after lesson. Try not to wait till consultations to ask if you find that you don't understand sth during class cos you will probably forget. When you ask, KEEP ASKING UNTIL YOU UNDERSTAND. No point asking then after that you only understand 70%. Make sure you understand fully when your tutor explains.

3rd Tip: HELP YOUR FRIENDS! When your friends are unsure of any questions, try to help them. You are also helping yourself. When my friends sent questions they dk how to do to the group chat, I will always try them. If you know, then do the questions, send to the group chat and explain. I either voice recorded the explanation or video-ed me doing the question and then send to the group. This will help you learn and consolidate. Everyone wins! Honestly, I saw ppl in JC being selfish and not helping others cause of the bell-curve. But I highly believe in Karma. What comes around goes around. If you selfish then don't help others, sekali later you suffer. No harm in helping your friends. 

4th Tip: WATCH YOUTUBE! Ok let me explain. I'm not talking about cat videos, food videos, or whatever you guys watch during your leisure time. When I studied, I always watch STUDY WITH ME LIVE videos. I prefer Korean study with me live videos cause more aesthetic haha. These vids basically are live streams of ppl studying for 10+ hours. Everyday I study while putting my phone in front of me with these videos on. Helps with motivation cause you see other ppl studying so hard haha. Another way, this one a bit weird lah. But i will take vids of myself studying. Especially when you're feeling productive. So during times when I want to slack for the whole day I will watch those vids that I took and somehow I felt more motivated haha idk why... But this tip is really more personalised for me, might not work for others. Especially if you tend to use your phone while studying, putting your phone in front of you might not be the best idea

Last Tip: PLEASE TAKE BREAKS! Last time in J1, I believed in mugging for the whole day straight, only taking toilet/meal breaks. That worked lah, but only for a while. I started to lose TONS of motivation from J2 CT2 onwards, and i realised i was burning out. No point studying for hours on end if you will burn out fast. Take breaks when you need them. After Prelims period, my study routine went like this: Wake up at 7.30am, eat breakfast until abt 8am, then study. As i said above I will watch the study with me live vids. Most of the youtubers they start their live stream around 8am also so I start whenever they start. Then I follow their routine, normally is like 2 hrs study, then 20 min break, but differs for each stream. If you dont want to watch the live stream, find a timetable that is right for you. During lunch time, I will watch whatever I want to watch (i was crazy about return of superman) so i will watch 1 ep of that. After the ep finish, i continue studying. When I take breaks I will go outside and talk to my mom or just get a quick shut-eye. OH YA i normally studied at home when As were approaching cause the travel time needed if i go outside to study abit long. But when i felt like i needed a change in environment i will go out to study. Ok back to my point, if you are tired, rest. Don't force yourself. Don't restrict yourself too much either. If you have the urge to check insta, then check insta. If you restrict yourself too much you will end up binging (eg being on tiktok or insta etc for hours). 

Ok this one really last tip: COMPARE WITH FRIENDS, BUT COMPARE HEALTHILY! Ppl always say dont compare yourself with others, but personally I feel doing abit of comparing is actually necessary. If you're lacking behind but most of your friends are doing well, then gotta see what you're doing wrong/ what others are doing right. But do not obsess over comparison. I had peers last time who were too uptight, like will face black when you do better than them those kind. Like that only bring unecessary stress to themselves. Be happy for your friends when they do well, but also learn from them, ask them what are their study methods. My friends were all really nice, we would share our study methods with each other then some of us will try and adopt and ended up improving. If your friends don't want to share their study methods with you, then find new friends. 

Ok thats about it i write damn long liao idt most of you read the whole things oops. I actually have so many more tips i want to share, but idw to sound like grandma. But if you guys have any questions regarding studying for As or even tutorial questions, feel free to pm me.

100,[Poly] =/= ITE for JC rejects & [ITE] =/= it’s the end,"It’s just so upsetting that people perceive poly to be “ite for jc rejects” and ite to be “it’s the end”. Why does this social stigma still exist? I could recall the time last yr where my L1R5 score for my Sec 4 MYEs was 41. The vp told me with such results, ITE wouldn’t even want me. Coming from the “best class” , yerpz my classmates laughed at how even if I went to ITE, it would be the end for me. (One mth aft results release, my vp asked me which ite I was posted to, I swear I had the urge to rub my results slip on her face) but yeA I manage to get into the poly course I want and what I wanna say is - times have changed guys, please do not discriminate against poly/ite students. These institutions cater to our varying strengths and weaknesses, and we may not be as academically inclined as compared to JC peeps. If you have not experienced what it’s like being in ite/poly please do not assume. It does not mean we’re in ite/poly means that we have more free time or wtv. Yes, we may have more holidays than compared to those in JC , but we use the time to finish our projects and assignments as well. I feel that we should create more awareness about this “issue” in Singapore. Well, there are people with single digit scores gg to poly bc they feel that the poly curriculum suit them better. Besides, ite is NOT the end. Have you seen former ITE students getting into local Uni? Yes you’d prolly have. It’s all up to whether the student is determined to do it or not. Some students take more time to flourish as an individual. 
Such pathways should serve as a platform for us to recognise our strengths and not be discouraged by our flaws. It should not serve as a platform where we are being “ranked” based on academic ability. My parents “disowned” me for being a “poly student”  and a “disgrace to the family” but I’m rlly thankful for holding onto a scholarship to pay off my sch fees :,) Being the first in the family to enter poly does not mean I cannot succeed. What really matters is believing in oneself. In fact, I’m doing much better compared to Sec sch.

101,[A levels] TIPS FOR JC STUDENTS,"With the recent release of my A-level results, I thought it'll be nice to share things I wished I knew before I embarked on my 2 years of JC 

 *In School*
- Seek enjoyment in learning: don't see learning as a mundane routine or obligation but seek satisfaction in understanding new concepts and applying them correctly.
- Utilise your breaks well: eg. Finish homework during longer breaks but rest for shorter ones to focus well the next lesson.
- Don't fall behind or get into vicious cycles: do your tutorials before the teachers go through them and stay at the lecturers' pace. If you lag behind you might feel defeated and lose motivation to catch up. (This is not to say you cannot catch up but just that it's easier to stay motivated when you stay with the school's pace)

*Study*
- Understand, not memorise concepts: With 20+ topics per subject, it's impossible to memorise everything. Also application requires understanding.
- Find learning methods which work for you: explore making notes in forms of mindmaps, lists, tables etc. and note that what works for your friends may not be what works for you.
- Consult your teachers: while you can try to understand concepts on your own, it is much more efficient to spend 3 minutes consulting your teacher than 30 mins trying to do it on your own.

*Social*
- Find the right communities to hang with: your peers really shape your attitude towards studying.
- Don't be fixated on a person or crush if its unhealthy: realistically speaking, your A-level results are much more likely to affect your future than that cute girl or guy.
- Don't be influenced by the performance of others: don't be demoralised if your friends are doing better than you, everybody learns at different paces, you just need to put in consistent effort. But also, don't feel too comforted and complacent if everyone does as badly as you (e.g whole cohort Us chemistry) because ultimately you need to know and understand all your concepts to do well for A-levels.

Lastly, don't put too much pressure on yourself! As long as you're putting in consistent effort and studying smart, you're on the right track. If you feel really tired and drained from studying, just know that many batches of students have felt the same and when you finish your A-level examinations with confidence, you'll realise it was all worth it.

102,[A Levels] H2 CHEMISTRY SUMMARY NOTES + rant + future plans," So over the past few weeks of circuit breaker has given me too much time as a bored NSF, and I made a thing. Well, to be fair, I was planning to make this thing regardless, circuit breaker or not, but boy has it given me all I needed to make this.

I am going to go on a long rant in the next few paragraphs, so if you just clicked for the notes, here they are:

[H2 Chemistry (9729) Summary Notes (2020 edition)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qsi0wwoBA_W54RXl4YvHaNzWn43gG_WpLuSetLCE_3I/edit?usp=sharing)

I’m just gonna say, I’m super proud of myself for being able to follow through and create this, because many of my other projects usually don’t go to completion. But I will also admit that these notes are inherently imperfect in the sense that I did not take Chemistry at A-Levels, not even at the H1 level (my subject combination was PFMg + H3 Physics). So if anyone more qualified than me is willing to give their opinion on the notes, you’re definitely more than welcome to do so. I was inspired by the positive response to my summary notes for H1, H2 and H3 Physics last year to create something similar for other subjects (scroll all the way down for links).

At this point you may be thinking: How in the world did you manage to compile notes for a subject you don’t even take? Well, some people may call me crazy, but yes I did ‘study’ the subject from scratch 2 months after my A-Levels last year. I took my friend’s lecture notes for both H2 Chemistry and H2 Biology (with permission of course) during a New Year’s Eve countdown party, before embarking on a month-long trip to Australia and realising I had forgotten to bring the notes. Oops.

So ten days before enlistment, I landed back in Singapore and finally started reading set after set of Chemistry notes, trying my hardest to cover one topic a day. But then enlistment hit and I couldn’t do that anymore. I tried my best to squeeze in some time during BMT (e.g. admin time and weekends) to read the notes, and by the end of the fourth week I had managed to finish the entire collection for Chemistry. For the second half of BMT, I was fortunate enough to have a section mate that took H3 Chemistry, so I persuaded him to give me his notes in exchange for my H2 F Math notes in camp. A few days later, a classmate in JC agreed to give me her H1 Chemistry notes. It was also around this time that I went to Popular and bought myself a copy of the H2 Chemistry Topical TYS to practice and for reference.

Now I didn’t really have the energy to finish the TYS, so these summary notes are not yet set in stone and I will probably edit them for greater clarity / elegance / presentation in the future. But for now, I am obsessed with getting the summary notes out for you guys ASAP so here they are.

After this, I have plans to release more notes in the future:

\- H1 Chemistry: I already have the notes, and most of it can be copy-pasted over from H2 Chemistry. This will be my next notes release.

\- H3 Chemistry: I already have the notes, but I am planning to do H2 Biology first because there is probably a greater demand for that.

\- H2 Biology: I have the notes, but I don’t have the TYS and can’t get one during CB. The TYS will be crucial as it will tell me how much to elaborate for each point especially for an essay subject like this. Once I get the TYS I will start making the notes, but I will have no idea as to how long it will take since I haven’t received my NS unit posting yet and hence won’t know how much free time I will have. I will try to aim for October but I can’t make any promises.

\- H1 Biology: I have read the syllabus document and (I think) it doesn’t have H1-exclusive content like Chemistry does, so it will probably be just a simple cut-n-paste exercise once I am done with H2. I will probably release both together, or maybe I will split them just so I could get that juicy, useless karma.

\- H3 Biology: Okay this one is one that I don’t yet have the material to study. Unfortunately, almost no one takes it (only 2 girls in my school out of almost 900 students in my cohort), and DMing them for their ~~nudes~~ notes months after they had graduated would be nothing short of creepy (like that guy in Maroon 5’s [Animals music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpgTC9MDx1o)). So if any of you out there are willing to donate their lecture notes to this greedy boy here in exchange for early access to the summary notes I create, please feel free to DM me.

\- H1/H2 Mathematics and H2 Further Mathematics: I do have thoughts of creating them at some point, but I can’t seem to find a (free) way to render math expressions in Google Docs without creating an ugly mess. If anyone knows how to do it please feel free to enlighten me.

\- H1/H2 Geography: This is the only Arts subject which I am probably willing to make notes for, since I don’t really like studying Arts subjects all that much. I do take H1 Geography in JC and I still have the lecture notes (of course, why would I throw away precious knowledge, right?), but the potential amount of typing I have to do frightens me. Luckily for me I am on good terms with my geography teacher, so maybe I could ~~blackmail~~ persuade her into giving me the H2 lecture notes (if I ever get to finish the H1 summary notes).

\- O-Level subjects: I do have old notes for Physics, Chemistry and Biology (all pure) from my O-level days lying around in my Google Drive somewhere, and I would just need to update and clean them up to get them ready for release. To all the combined science kids, I definitely won’t leave you out either, for I can just use the power of Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V. And just like for A-Levels, I could probably create notes for Mathematics / Additional Mathematics once I have the tools, and (elective) Geography once I have the willpower.

\- Possible extension to N(A) and N(T) levels: Given the rarity of such notes out there, this seems like prime virgin land to conquer. I initially thought of going as far down as PSLE, but I figured that the main focus of PSLE is more of conceptual understanding and skills application rather than content recall, and this can’t really be achieved with my style of summary notes.

At this point you may be wondering why I am doing this, since I supposedly gain nothing from this, and to be honest, I don’t really know. Maybe I am afraid that serving NS will take away my love of learning and hoarding knowledge, and a desire to maintain a sense of continuity from my previous life of academic learning. Maybe I just feel that there are not enough free things in this world, and I just want to ease the financial burden on every Singapore student in the tiniest of ways possible. Maybe I’m just a sadist who longs to see the economy crash from there being too much free stuff in this world (the economy has probably already crashed LOL). Or maybe I have no friends and just want some validation from those who use my notes. Whatever it may be, just be glad that I exist to create notes for you.

\--

Okay that was definitely way too much drama. If you have made it this far, a big thank you for listening to this long rant of mine, and I hope you find this set of notes useful in your studying of H2 Chemistry. Cheers!

P.S. Some of you may be wondering why my notes are not on exams.sg. Don’t get me wrong, I think exams.sg is a wonderful place for people to post notes. But it doesn’t let me post links, and saving the notes as PDF doesn’t allow me to edit the notes as and when I want to, which I like to do a lot, and the people there probably don’t want to see a million different versions of the same notes. I even considered posting a PDF containing nothing but the Google Docs link, but that would definitely raise a few eyebrows. I would love for my notes to be on exams.sg one day, and if anyone knows a way to get around this problem, do let me know. Thanks.

103,[A Levels] A note on free resources and purchasing other students' work,"Hey guys, I know A Levels are underway and many of you are looking for study notes and resources. 

The reason I'm making this post is because I recently found my notes, which I shared a few months ago [on this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gtu175/a_levels_free_notes_gp_econs_computing/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=mweb), the SGExams library, on my website, and to many of my juniors, being sold on [Carousell](https://carousell.app.link/qF2GNKljpab). 

While there is some additional content appended to the end of my notes, the document is still, largely, mine. The Carouseller advertised my notes as written ""by an RI student who scored 90RP for A Levels"", and sold it for $11. It has 30 likes, and probably quite a number of purchases. I'm not from RI (or any top-tier JC for that matter), although I did score 90RP. This ""industry"" loves to exploit students' stress and desperation to make easy money, which is why I have always believed in providing study resources for free to those who need them, and tuition at an extremely affordable rate.

There are many, many other resources that are meant to be free, but are also being sold online. What am I trying to say here? There is a plethora of resources you can find online - posts from this subreddit, the SGExams library, and even your seniors. Please check those first! I have never needed to purchase any  external resources thanks to the huge pool of notes available online. If you need to, please verify the source of the notes you are purchasing online - this will go a long way in promoting an open-source environment for all students :)

UPDATE: It appears that the listing (and most other listings by the Carouseller) is now gone. Anyway, spread the word about the SGExams library to your friends! Don't give these people business :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j770n8/a_levels_a_note_on_free_resources_and_purchasing/,True,2020-10-08 20:57:20
104,[Uni] Useful NUS resources for freshies (part 1 of ?),"Hi. Me again. I know e-orientations have been happening, but I know there are many people like me who don't attend orientations, and were probably as lost as I was. I also remember how there weren't really resources/guides to surviving in uni as a freshie. So in part 1 of ?, here's how to get Microsoft Office, make references like a pro (ie. without pulling your hair out), and getting access to readings. I've tried to collate some of the resources that NUS provides into this post. The instructions should be reasonably easy to follow.

&#x200B;

1. How to get Microsoft Office (which you're paying for, by the way)

Yes, you get Microsoft Office as part of your university essentials. However, it is not the most straightforward thing in the world to get. First, you need to get NUS VPN.

0.5. How to get NUS VPN (or nVPN)

Download nVPN from [here](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/eguides/) (for the OS that you're using), and install it. Follow the guide [here](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/nVPN-config-guide-for-students.pdf) to install it and ensure you're connected to the NUS VPN before continuing.

After you're connected, go [here](https://share.nus.edu.sg/cce-services/softwaresubscription/default.aspx) and accept the license conditions. Next, go to [this page](https://portal.office.com/account/) (while logged in to your NUSNET email) and you can install Office from there. Do note that you also get access to Microsoft Office on your mobile devices, and 1TB of OneDrive storage. ([source article](https://nusit.nus.edu.sg/services/software_and_os/software/software-student/#install-office) for further reference)

Note: the source article also has other software available, although they're mostly specialist software that isn't applicable for the general student population.

Sidenote: Since we (or at least FASS) are studying from home, NUS VPN is useful if you need to access the NUS SharePoint or the [NUS Portal](https://myportal.nus.edu.sg/) when not on campus. If you're not accessing these two resources, you do not need to connect to the NUS VPN. Luminus, Edurec and so on are accessible without the VPN.

&#x200B;

2. Get Mendeley and never worry about referencing again

Mendeley is a piece of software that NUS has purchased access to, which does referencing for you automagically. We also have access to EndNote, but Mendeley is far superior imo. It is a lifesaver for anyone who has essay assignments, so I would strongly recommend you to learn how to use it. I believe it is free for use as well, just that NUS purchased more storage.

First, ensure Microsoft Office is installed. Next, go [here](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/mendeley/MIE) and follow the instructions to get Mendeley Institutional Edition. It's not actually necessary, but hey, more storage never did anybody harm. Next, download Mendeley Desktop [here](https://www.mendeley.com/download-desktop-new/). Don't get Mendeley Reference Manager. Mendeley Desktop is older, but much more fully featured. Install Mendeley Desktop, then open it, login to your Mendeley account, and install the Citation Manager for Word. It will prompt you to install Mendeley Cite. Don't bother. The Citation Manager for Word works far better. Lastly, install [Mendeley Web Importer](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/web-importer). It works perhaps 70% of the time though (sometimes it refuses to login for me, but other times it works fine), so Mendeley Desktop is your backup in case it doesn't work, or if you don't use Chrome.

Citing with Mendeley Desktop is pretty straightforward. The easiest way for you to do this is to find the .ris file, if the journal/online resource offers it, and just download and import that into Mendeley.

If the .ris file is not available, on the page where you get your reading/article from, open the Mendeley Web Importer from your extensions menu. Or, you can drag and drop the reading/PDF/material into Mendeley and fill up the required bibliographical information, or you can add the entry manually without adding the PDF. Make sure the details are filled in correctly and completely. Then, in Microsoft Word > Referencing > insert citation, then insert the citation you want. You can select between various referencing styles next to the 'insert citation' button, or download other referencing styles from within Mendeley. Selecting 'insert bibliography' outputs all of the references that you've used for that essay/document.

Some of the bibliographical details that Mendeley asks for aren't strictly required, eg the abstract and ISBN, but it depends on the referencing style you're using. With some experience (and reading of sites like the [Purdue OWL resource](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/chicago_manual_17th_edition/cmos_formatting_and_style_guide/chicago_manual_of_style_17th_edition.html)), you will know what fields you need/don't need to fill. Mendeley does try to guess and/or download bibliographical information for your material. It is not always accurate however, so always check the information that it fills in automatically as it can sometimes be very inaccurate.

Even if you know referencing styles like the back of your hand, Mendeley is still really useful for when you need to generate a reference list or just ensuring you don't have silly mistakes/typos in your references. I organise my references by module (one folder for each module) to make things more organised too. It's a convenience thing.

&#x200B;

3. Learn to research with NUS Libraries

NUS Libraries has a crap ton of access to journal articles, books and the like. The [NUS Libraries Proxy bookmarklet](https://libguides.nus.edu.sg/findfulltext/proxybookmark) is your best friend. Add it to your bookmarks bar. You will use it, and you won't regret it.

Now, when you have readings assigned, or are doing research for your assignments, either google the title of the reading (including the authors' names, if necessary), or just search it in [NUS Libraries](https://libportal.nus.edu.sg/frontend/index). If you're doing the former, go to the page for the reading (eg [this one](http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14662043.2018.1468238)), then click on the Proxy bookmarklet, login (if needed), then you get full access to the PDF. In my experience, the proxy works for almost all journals that I've tried, as long as you try to obtain it from sources from which NUS has access to.

From experience, NUS Libraries has near unlimited access to publishers like Taylor & Francis, Cambridge University Press, Oxford Scholarship/Oxford University Press and JSTOR. If your book is from one of these publishers, you don't have to go to the library to photocopy the book or anything. Project Muse is hit and miss (NUS doesn't have access to everything), World Scientific is very annoying to download books from (rate limited; patience is key), and EBSCOHost (hosts ebooks for several publishers) has a page limit for downloads (hint: incognito mode, hit the limit, close the incognito window, and open another incognito window. You're welcome).

&#x200B;

4. NUSMods

Obligatory [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com) plug. Plan your timetable and look up module information. Student-run, too.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure how many parts I'm gonna make. I know I have some tips for module registration/planning for FASS, which I'll get to in another post soon. Do comment below or PM me if there's anything else that you're not sure about, and I'll see what I can do. Best if it's FASS-related; I am of zero help if your question is faculty-specific for the other faculties (sorry!) Hope this helps :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/htyu9k/uni_useful_nus_resources_for_freshies_part_1_of/,True,2020-07-20 03:12:35
105,[Junior colleges] Scared to be LGBTQ in Singapore schools :(,"After the recent Reddit post about the trans student being discriminated, I now have fear in my heart.

So I found out I was bisexual a few months ago, I was happy about it because I felt safe and that it was okay. I know Singapore is generally a conservative country but I was okay with it cuz I had friends that would support me. But I’m in SCHOOL and I found out there’s witch hunts for lesbians( from the transgender discrimination Reddit post’s comment section) and NOW I AM SCARED IF MY TEACHERS FIND OUT IM not straight. I’m scared they would expel me or send me to conversion therapy or my parents would end up knowing ( I’m in the mfking closet)

I’m not mentally stable either so I had a frequent sessions with my school counselor who is really an amazing person and helped me a lot. I was planning to tell her I was l was bisexual so she really knows how I feel. But now I feel like I dodged a bullet after I realised that MOE doesn’t really support the lgbtq community. Like I really trusted my Teachers and Counselors. And I’m so conflicted that I can’t trust  them cuz of MOE. Like what even?  

Now I’m scared if this is the case in University and even in the workplace. Like if There’s no anti discrimination laws for us, would be people just trample on our rights as a human being? 

It’s so frustrating because I feel so sad for being forced to hide myself for simply loving someone.

And when I read the comments about this news on other websites, it just shows how ignorant some Singaporeans are :( 

And just recently did MOE start prioritising mental health of seeing it’s impact due to the pandemic. 
LIKE COME ON ARENT WE A FIRST WORLD COUNTRY :( we should have started this eons ago. 

And now with the discriminations. 

Haiz what even :((((

106,[UNI] To all who have yet to receive offers,"Originally posted in [another thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g0fpmp/uni_no_news_is_good_news_how_true_is_this/), but thought I'd repost it since many of y'all here are still v stressed regarding lack of uni offers! 

P.S. To all seniors: do feel free to chime in your experiences regarding appeals, whether success or failure!! It'll provide the current batch with a realistic basis of what to expect &amp; possibly construct a better appeal :)

***
**For all who have yet to receive any news at all, its not a bad thing.**

No news means no rejection, no rejection is good. Universities **will** inform you of their decision via email, whether it be an acceptance or rejection. 

Not receiving anything yet may mean they haven't reached your application because your rp is too low, and they'll accept you later. Another possibility could be the covid situation resulting in lack of manpower to handle applications? We're going through an unprecedented pandemic which could be affecting university admission departments whom cannot work as efficiently as before🤷🏻‍♀️ Of course, eventually it may result in a rejection but until you receive that email, you never know. 

Think about it, after 24 May, will everyone offered that course accept that offer? No! For the high rp accepted into the big 3, they must reject the other 2 offers, meaning many slots opening up for 2nd wave of acceptance. 


++ Appealing is an option! Even if you're rejected from 1st wave, there's still chance of successful appeal after 24 may 2020 when 2nd wave starts [2019 Appeal Outcomes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bxwe2y/uni_appeal_outcomes_nus_ntu_smu/)


Even if you haven't received anything yet there's no need to panic, you've done your best for A levels/Poly &amp;amp; you have to leave the decisions up to the universities. There's nothing you can do to change anything for now. In the meantime, do try to enjoy the long break, you'll never get to enjoy such a long holiday once uni starts :)

If you're really very worried, what you can do is start drafting appeal letters for after 24 May, research on how it should be written &amp;amp; where it should be submitted. So that if after 24 May, should you really need to appeal, you'll already be prepared to submit a strong appeal letter &amp;amp; are aware of the procedures required. It'll give you a head start over those who only started writing after 24 May, which could boost your chances of a successful appeal ;)

But of course, pls be realistic. Do refer to [bit.ly/uni_igp](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MPEDZpw26TjN7dTsQzsbnXHZa47og0qSrdHrlT7nLKc/pubhtml) when deciding if it's worth it to appeal to your desired course. If your rank points is more than 4/5 points of the previous years igp, do consider other courses instead, as your appeal is unlikely to succeed. If you haven't had any related work experience to your desired course, or any spectacular extra curriculars, it will be very hard to enter a course where your grades don't meet the mark. You were initially rejected for a reason, if you can't come up with anything extra to boost your appeal, it will be harder to get in. Especially considering the current trend of rising rank points needed to enter courses this year, it will be harder to appeal successfully into a course if your rank points/gpa is very far off previous years cut offs. 

For now, try not to stress too much about it ok! We're going through tough times &amp; I'm sure the universities are trying their best to sieve through the thousands of applicants as quickly as possible too &gt;&lt;

- things to remind during exam

~ if you chilled out during exam, take a deep breath, then try it again, remember this is just a stage of your life, no matter the result your future is always bright.

~ if you still don't remember some formula, or unclear about some topics, take a look now, still have a chance

~ dont make careless mistakes, such as copy wrongly( for example 4x-2 become 4x+2) use your time wisely so you can have extra time to check after you finished

~ yesterday I saw an ad about modified calculator on YouTube, so I want remind you guys don't cheat, because you can cheat your results but you can never cheat your life.

That's all I could help, all the best guys!

I’ve been wondering if it’s a placebo effect or did it do anything at all for y’all? I feel bad for my parents who want best for me and is spending money on it for a chance for me to keep my immune system up and do well for exams so I will drink the whole box!!! 


I just want to know what benefits have y’all seen haha I’m curious since I’m finally being forced to drink it during my As after all these years :)

110,[RANT] Has anyone experience déjà vu and foreseeing yourself in the future?,"I  woke up a few hours  and unknowingly started crying. I saw my exam paper  in my dreams and my results. And I told my siblings and my parents about it. Turns out I wasn't the only one who dreamt about seeing my grades. My siblings also dream about me getting a perfect score for IB too and what I saw was a 45/45 in my dream. I really can't believe that because my grades right now is in the high 30s/45 not even 40s yet. Hours after I woke up a déjà vu just appeared. I was doing the same exact thing as my dream and I started finding my work was getting easier as I started doing. This happen to me not once or twice but many times. Even for Os I forseen my papers (I even told my friends about the topics coming out and they gotten As for that subjects) and my mum foresee my results to be 6 (and I did get 6) ?? I don't know if I am insane or what. My brain is like unable to cope with this right now and I am trying not to scream as I'm typing this right now.

In lecture, they're the noisy people who make lessons so much harder to follow, or even force the lecturer to stop just to manage them.

In tutorials, they're the ones asking irrelevant or stupid questions because they think it's 'cool', or because they didn't bother to pay attention or prepare beforehand.

112,[Jobs] Commonly Asked Job Interview Questions Part 1 (+My take on how to approach them),"Hello again! This was something I had on my mind the whole day and I was pretty much writing down questions I've encountered, heard/seen a lot of that comes up during job interviews the whole day.

This list of questions are not exhaustive so bear in mind that hiring managers can ask anything during job interviews and also the questions can vary quite a bit depending on industry as well as level of job expertise required.

Why do you need to care about what questions are asked during job interviews? Can't we just go in and talk our way through? You can absolutely do that but unless you have the gift of the gab, I would not recommend it because most people who don't prepare for job interviews go in looking **UNPREPARED** and it reflects really poorly on you as a potential candidate. It'll lead to long awkward pauses, a lots of ""err"" & ""umm"", incoherent sentences and ultimately sending a poor message to the employer that you are indeed the employee they are after.

Disclaimer: My answers are not perfect nor will it fit all kind of job interviews. But if you can answer all these questions confidently and clearly in a sensible and logical manner, then you are halfway to success. Obviously there are other aspects of an interview to be concerned with as well such as first appearances, body language, technical requirements etc but this is a big part of a job interview.

**Tell me about yourself**

As simple as it sounds, most people struggle with this. This question can mean a few different things, and it sounds like you can see that. They may be interested in your work history and education. They may be interested in your skills. They may be interested in who you are as a person and what you do for fun. Use the timing of the question and the context to figure out which one. If it's at the beginning of an interview, it's more about education and skills. If you've been chatting about side stuff, it's more personal. Think of this as an elevator pitch for yourself especially if it is asked at the start of an interview.

**What is your dream job like?** 

An interviewer wants to see if you are going to be a good investment for the company or a good match for the job. If your dream job is something office based and stress free and the job you are applying for is in a sales role where you are always out of office for most of the time then that is a poor fit for the job (just a blatant example). 

Sure you can lie your way through such that your answer fits in line with what the interviewing company is looking for based on their job ad but I would not recommend doing so because if you don't fit and you lie your way in then you'll just end up being really unhappy most of the time.Be honest with a touch of pragmatism. 

I believe that most redditors are students or entry level graduates so if you are looking for an entry level role, don't make unrealistic job expectations like 9-5 only, stress free, no OT, no calling/ emailing me after office hours, give me X% pay raise year on year (considering that you are in SG after all). It'll just make you sound out of touch with reality.

**Why did you leave your last job?** 

If you are looking for the first full time job after graduation, then it may refer to your part time job/internships that you held during your student years. Give out a positive response around the idea that you are in pursuit of greener pastures without sounding condescending. For me I crafted my response around seeking a desire to take on new challenges after honing the last one and I left my job in a much better position than it was when I came in.

**DON'T EVER TALK SHIT ABOUT YOUR LAST JOB/EMPLOYERS** no matter how factual it is even if it was a really really bad experience for you. They will just imagine you doing the same thing to your next employer after them.

**What is your weakness?** 

""I work too hard"", ""I've never worked here before"", ""I have no weakness"" If you are going to use these answers then let's just hope the interviewers have a better sense of humour than I do.The reason this is asked is not really to find out your weaknesses, but to screen candidates capable of **introspection** and **self-improvement**. The best response is to actually tell them one of your weaknesses, phrased as something you'd like to improve. S

ome examples are (depends on the role and industry it may or may not be relevant):*""I'm working to get better at multitasking, as my previous job had me focus on single tasks for large blocks of time.""*

*""I don't have a lot of experience dealing with difficult employees, as the teams I supervised at my previous two positions were all really cohesive.""*

*""I've never had a chance to work with <specific, non-job critical tool> before and I see you use that a lot here, so I'm keen to learn how to use it.""*

**What are your strengths?** 

The inverse of the previous question and here you can probably be a bit more generous and share more about yourself so long as you know when it is too much information. This is a perfectly good example to use the tips from my last post on using examples during job interviews to your advantage. Use **CAR** or **STAR** format to illustrate your point. Just because you say you are a good leader doesn't mean you will be a good leader. **Demonstrate it** **verbally**

**What do you know about what our company/department and the type of work we do?**

Testing your knowledge of the company (AKA your pre-interview research). At the very minimum you should  know the company's public information by heart and are able to summarise it. If you can't even be bothered to do some googling or research, then how can you expect the company to hire you? 

If you want to go the extra mile and impress, read up more from news/journals/articles to stay abreast of what the company/team has been up to currently and share some personal opinion of yours (it can be very helpful if you do it right but backfires if you take it out of context or add a poor touch of opinion).

What I did before was that through lots of reading I found out what technological problems my company/team was facing from an interview one of the senior execs at the company shared publicly (which was related to my role they were hiring for) and I used it to my advantage to illustrate the need for my particular role and how I would be able to value add to the company with my set of skills. Remember - **INFORMATION IS POWER**

**Why should we hire you?**

I talked about the requirements of the job and explained how my skills/experience meet those requirements. Basically, a borderline conceited level of self confidence without looking elitist.

**Would you consider yourself successful?** 

They are trying to assess your past achievements and determine whether you will be driven to achieve such results in the future. Don't sound overly cocky, strike a balance when answering this. This question also allows the interviewer  to understand how you define success, and what milestones in your career you consider important.

You may not consider yourself to be a success but think of the question as an invitation to discuss the professional characteristics that you're proud of or a particular achievement in one of your past jobs/student role. Focus on the things you've done at that you're proud of, and which helped your team/company succeed.

**Why is there a gap between X and Y? Why had you been unemployed for Z period of time?** 

For employers, if you've had a period of unemployment, it may be a red flag. Asking that question is an opportunity to clarify things. The best answer would be something that shows you were learning during that time, but it should be fine to say something like you took some time out to travel after graduation because you expect yourself to work full-time for many years to come so this was a good opportunity for you to spend some time on yourself and family before moving on to the next step. Or you simply were in full time education prior to this interview.

I'm sure in most cases they just want some reassurance that you haven't been rejected by a gazillion companies first (even if you have), or that you haven't been fired in the first few months of another job and left it off your resume.You don't have to give them any private details, just answer confidently to show that you've come to the end of that stage and are ready to start work.

OK this is way longer than what i had expected so I'll stop here for now. I probably have enough questions in my head to go for Part 2 and Part 3 so I'll pick this up shortly.

Since our establishment in 2017, the SGExams team has continuously striven to support a better student community, and this journey would not have been possible without all of you. With the arrival of 2021, we are thrilled to share that SGExams have been officially registered as the “Society of Student Affairs (Singapore)”, under the Societies Act!

What does this mean for us? Well, here's a rundown of the things that will change, and the things that won't:

1. We're now legal! Any organisation above 10 people are required to register, thus we decided to put ourselves under the Society Act as a Society. This will not affect any of you, and all our fantastic communities will go on as per usual!
2. Any money that flows through us will be better accounted for! Any form of revenue that we get, be it donations, grants, or even advertising revenue, will be accounted for properly, and audited by IRAS and MHA, so you don't have to worry that any money is being misused!
3. Any volunteer that volunteers in the committee, or even at any of our events, are eligible for CIP hours! We are able to, in an official capacity, issue CIP hours to students that contribute their time to help us out. As we grow, we'll have more opportunities for you to volunteer with us. In fact, we're holding a [recruitment drive](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kguwju/meta_sgexams_committee_recruitment/) right now!
4. Being a registered non-profit, we are better recognised by organisations like MOE, NYC, and thus will allow us to work with bigger partners to bring you bigger and better events that benefits you and your friends!

Most importantly, our communities will not change. We are proud of what the community has done over the years, and we are committed to not make any fundamental changes to how our communities function.

From a team of less than 10 people doing moderation work, to the 50+ people we have now, we are all extremely excited to show you what we have in store in 2021, and we hope you're excited too!

If you have any questions or comments, please feel free to leave them down below and we will try our best to answer them all!

114,[O Levels] Missed half the papers,"im screwed im really really screwed; the day before hell week of o’s began i suddenly developed a high fever- no explaination whatsoever.

cue the panic and the panadol spam lol. clearly it was not sufficient as i was unable to go for my ss paper on monday...(i dropped amath lol can’t amath at all) and was told i could come for the next days paper IF my swab test result came out the same night. long story short that did not happen :’) missed todays papers as well because the test results came out at 2.10pm, if it came just like two hours earlier i would have rushed to school. 

seriously what a great way to spend my birthday right???

exam cpe told me that i had to go to the doctor again to verify if i could go for tomorrows papers- pulled myself out of bed and walked all the way to the nearest clinic only to be told that i was not allowed to go back to school and had to go back the next day for a dengue test, kms.

ok but side note i missed basically the whole of prelims except for practicals and my english papers because of dengue...so my marks were pro rated already.. and its really burning a hole in my pocket like all the doctor visits are really adding up and i rly dont dare ask my parents for money because i feel bad?

im terrified that i wont be able to get into the jc i want. i dsa-ed to a jc and got accepted, but im super super scared that because of all this i will get L1R5 21 or something like that and honestly my whole world will literally come crashing down because im just simply not interested in any poly courses and i want to continue my basketball journey in a good jc with a good bball team. i studied my ass off for os and its such a waste that i wont even get to take the papers.
genuinely hope that no one in my school will see this lol, probably made my identity wayyyy too obvious.

117,[rant] My JC experience and post-A level thoughts.,"This post is probably going to contain some controversial views, I do not intend to sugarcoat anything. 

I finished my A levels a while ago and would like to express my views about this arduous 1.5(?) year journey. 

Here’s some background information about myself so that it’ll be easier to understand my position and point of view. Hopefully I don’t appear as an arrogant person trying to flex, though I could care less about my reputation in an online forum and some internet points. Alright, I’m basically your average mugger who scores good grades. For school exams, I have consistently scored A’s for my H2’s, though I flunked my mid years in J2 and got 2 B’s for them. You’d think that someone like me wouldn’t be suffering in JC, right? Well, all I can say to that is I wish that was the case. 


A levels has been the most I’ve ever been pushed. Yes, O levels is nothing compared to this. If A levels were a 10/10, O levels would be a 1. During my secondary school days, I was essentially wasting all my after-school time gaming and whatnot. In stark contrast, I found myself studying even after school during my JC years. During J1 and early J2, it wasn’t all that bad. I still had time to do stuff I wanted like go to the gym, play games, etc, though this was probably because I was doing well. I had breathing room, but it was unfortunately an ephemeral luxury. Remember when I said I flunked my midyears? Yeah. After that happened, I felt worthless as I had regressed so much and failed to get what I wanted despite putting in a tremendous amount of effort during the CB HBL period. It ended up taking up quite a toll on my mental health. I remember I flunked my GP so bad that I didn’t even want to look at my exam script and the marker’s comments out of sheer fear. It was debilitating, really. What’s worse is that a guy in my class literally told me this as I was checking my results. “It doesn’t matter that no one in our class got an A because in the end, I still beat you.” The competitive culture in Singapore’s education system is abhorrent, it really is. It never fails to rear its ugly head in every educational institute, and is even more prominent in JC where people are generally more study-oriented. It is sad to see that some people seek validation through scoring better than others, as if their own self-worth is derived from that. If you are that guy reading this, my sincerest “fuck you” to you. 


I am also well aware that there are people who struggle to pass and me saying that getting a B is underwhelming can be quite infuriating. This brings me to another topic. When I (and perhaps others in a similar position as me) say a specific grade is trash, it is based on my own expectations. Quite frankly, people need to stop assuming that if I am calling my B grade mediocre, I am calling everyone else’s B and below grades mediocre or worse. I’ve used this analogy once and I’ll use it again. An average student being upset that an A student failed to get his A is akin to an average powerlifter feeling vexed about Eddie hall complaining that he couldn’t deadlift 300kg. It’s absurd when you think about it. However, I do understand that it can feel like shit when someone goes around being depressed about a grade you yearn to achieve. But does that make their feelings invalid? No. If you’re going to say that I should be proud about getting a B, even though my (realistic) goal is getting an A, simply because getting a B to you is amazing, then I might as well say that your goal of getting a C is nothing to be proud of because “aye lmao I can get that with my eyes closed why are you even proud of something so easy to get lolololol.” Sounds pretty toxic, doesn’t it? People have their own goals, so please stop trying to extrapolate your goals onto others. “Good grades” don’t have a definitive shape and varies from individual to individual. 


Now I would like to talk about school exams. This may sound elitist, but in my view, school exam papers are very much harder than A level papers. Ask any student from an elite school and they would probably tell you that the easiest exam they have taken in their JC life would be A levels itself. Teachers have always claimed that school exams aren’t that much harder, if even at all. Why? Well, my best guess would be that they want to ensure that their students do not get complacent and rest on their laurels (assuming they have been doing well) or continue to work harder. The method is definitely efficacious, at least from my personal interactions with my friends and from what I’ve read online. Students seem unsatisfied with their school-based exam results and continue to strive to improve, perhaps because they are worried that they have failed to meet their expectations for a difficult paper. But at what cost? Just take a look around this subreddit and you’d find many posts about people being worried about their grades. The method of using fear to incentivise students to study is definitely good at improving their academic prowess, but can the same be said for their mental health? What is even worse is the way some Teachers address this issue. I personally know some Teachers who consistently urge students to study, and believe that more study = better grades. On the surface that does seem true, as it is intuitive, but the recipe for academic success does not only include working hard. Breaks are important too, we are not machines. My physics HOD has also blatantly called the entire cohort “not smart” at the start of the year due to poor cohort performance. During A levels, she has also emphasised competition, using phrases like “what makes you better than another candidate” to address the cohort. Is this the kind of unhealthy, competitive culture that we really want? Are we going to sacrifice every ounce of our mental well-being to attain good grades, get a good job, and be another statistic on Singapore’s GDP? I acknowledge that there is a need to push students in elite schools, but do we also have to breed such a toxic mindset while we do it? 


School exams being excessively hard also, in my opinion, serve as a means to segregate students in the school. In top schools, many students are able to get an A easily for A levels. RI, HCI, NYJC, VJC, etc. having such high distinction rates corroborates this. This essentially means that if the exams were to be set at A levels’ standard, many students would be deemed as equal due to achieving the same grade. By setting a much harder paper, those who are able to achieve A for that paper are able to be distinguished from those who cannot get A for that school paper but can get it for A levels. It just gives students a way to say “hey I’m better than you.” The result? Perhaps the reinforcement of elitism, segregation of students based on their academic prowess, and of course, the toxic competition which I have personally experienced. Again, it really isn’t good for mental health. 


I also think something worth noting about A levels is that it’s most likely going to obliterate whatever social life you have, at least if you’re the studious type. Personally, after around mid-J2, I started planning my activities with only one goal in mind: A levels. It would be a truism to say that I spent a lot, and almost all, of my free time studying but what is more interesting is that the other activities I did were all for the sake of studying as well. When I took breaks, I honestly didn’t do so for the sake of having fun. I did it because it would rejuvenate me to study even more. I knew I wasn’t a machine and I needed breaks to study effectively and to work towards my goal of A levels. I also snacked a lot, and it wasn’t because I was hungry. The food tasted good and made me feel more willing to study, more rejuvenated. Again, for A levels. I cut down on “ineffective” activities like gyming and socialising. Why? They achieved the same thing as gaming, snacking, watching videos, etc. but they took considerably much more time. This wasn’t a good way for me to achieve my goal because it was simply an inferior method of recreation. In essence, I sacrificed a lot of other parts of my life (health, social life, etc.) for the sake of A levels. Yes, it’s pretty pathetic and sad but I suppose it’s the consequence of a meritocratic society placing heavy emphasis on international examinations. After all, this isn’t poly or Uni where you have a GPA, you only have one bullet and you have to make your shot count. So much for holistic development, huh?


To wrap things up, my A levels experience had its ups and downs. I wouldn’t say it was the best experience, but it definitely wasn’t the worst. Many people struggled far more than me with their studies and I’m sure they’ve suffered more. But the point of this post is to say that, even as a “top” student, A levels wasn’t a breeze, to say the least. But if I could go back in time and redo my JAE, would I still go to JC? Of course. I came here because I liked studying and was interested in the content being taught. Hearing my poly friends speak about their group work experiences terrifies me, sounds like they’re doing PW 24/7. But I suppose that awaits me in uni.

118,"[A Levels] Why do NYJCians, at least those on Reddit, like to sh*t on other JCs while making NYJC so great?","Noticed this trend that some people have been constantly saying bad stuff about other JCs in order to glorify NYJC. Not sure if anyone noticed? Might be the same person but to whoever you are, it doesn't really make NYJC look good this way. Honestly, everyone's experience in JC is different. And furthermore, if you are an NYJCian, how would you know that the other JCs are so 'bad' if you're not even from there? If you're not from NYJC, how would you know that NYJC is so 'good' if you're not even from there?

Honestly, I've heard lots of bad things about NYJC but would not go to your level and start sh*tposting. Because I know that what I've heard may not be indicative of NYJC. Maybe you should change your perspective and realise that NYJC, or any one JC, is not all perfect. And that it is not really nice to be bringing other JCs down to make one JC look good. 

Sure, I understand that we all have our own personal opinions but we should all show some graciousness even though Reddit is anonymous. 

Oh yes, and some people have also been spreading unverified news about NYJC's 'excellent' A-Level results to the point that people now deem it as a fact. Well the fact is, NYJC, at least in recent years, is very secretive about its results. All that hearsay about NYJC's 'excellent' results is not official and should be taken with a pinch of salt. Please don't conribute to the spreading of unverified information. In fact, those I know from NYJC did not do very well for A-Levels compared to those from the JCs you've been sh*tting on, but then again this is not indicative of the school's quality. 

And it might be true that NYJC's chem department is good, but all my friends from NYJC were forced to drop chem to H1 at the end of J1. Statistically speaking, this might inflate NYJC's overall H2 chem results. But again, this is just my friends' experience, so I will not go so far as to say that because of this, NYJC's chem department is bad.

You get my point right? I try not to turn my experiences or my friends' experiences, whether good or bad, into hard facts. Sure, we can all share our experiences, but please don't put other JCs down. 

Also, to my juniors, I hope that you will make informed decisions not solely based on one's biased opinions but consider multiple perspectives and factors before coming to a decision.

After all, a school should not only produce academic results, but students with good character as well.

Sorry for the messy post.
TLDR; 
To people sh*tting on other JCs, it doesn't make the JC you support look good.
To juniors, don't be too quick to judge.

119,[Rant] History is not useless!,"So many people believes history to be useless, iveejust saw someone that said: 'choose econs, it's useful in our daily life today while history serves no purpose'. Like gurl, did you ever sfudied history???? 

History is not useless. If it's useless why would seab even offer it as a subject? History gives us a glimps of what have happened in the past, and how it shaped the believes and customs of a people. CMC thought us the importance of international communication, the rise of the economies of the 4 Asian tiger taught the developing world how to advance as an economy, the chapters on UN tells us the current political climate of the world. It's funny how we can even choose to study WW2 in sec school, some people who did not take hist in upper sec does not realise the true atrocities that the third rech and the risng sun have commited during that time, imagine seeing a SS logo on a shirtand (oh that looks cool) proceed to wear it on vacation to Europe, boom instant scorn and maybe even jail. Same goes for westerners who gets angry and upset when they see swastks all over Asia, when it originally meant peace and wellness in multiple world cultures. Hell we don't even study Chinese history in school, when the main reason South east Asia is like today is because Zhenghe and the waves of Chinese immigrants starting from the 1400s, did you know it is zhenghe who hasten the spread of Islm in south east Asia? Same goes for Indian history, Hnduism and Bddhism have large impacts on SEA history and yet we basically ignore them in our history syllabus. Isn't it embarrassing to not know the history of your own people? To not know to origin story of your culture? To not know know the people and event that even allowed you to exist? Of course econs probability have more use in our lives TODAY, but straight up stating history serves no purpose is definitely myopic. 

Imo I think the history syllabus is Singapore is definitely lacking, history is a compulsory subject in high school for almost every single country. While in Singapore you can basically choose to ignore it after sec 2. The topics tested is also quite dissapointing as they mostly goes through Cold war + Asia economy + south east Asia history, which I definitely relevant for life in SEA, but to leave out the modern history of Africa , south America and everything else in Asia is bad. Not to add that we completely do not learn pre modern history, no dynatical Chinese history, no medieval European history, not even the Victorian era history which is when most of the current great powers of the world started to rise. Even Singaporean history is not taught well, srivijaya and majapahit is a single liner in textbooks, and the voyages of zhenghe is barely mentioned, the rise of Malaccan sultinate, Portuguese domination pre Dutch, etc... It's just all very lacking.

Another perspective: As a Taiwanese, would you prefer to be ignorant about the white terror? As a Korean, would you have liked to not know the Japanese occupation and Korean war? As a Pole, would you forget the partitions? As a Jew, would you stay oblivious of the holocauxx? Then, as a Singaporean, although our history of suffering is not as long as the other nations, we should still stay informed of our past. 

-歷史可以被原諒,但不可以被忘記 (History could be forgiven, but not forgotten) 

To recommend a quick read, go find a Barron's SAT subject test on World history. 

Ps. Had to censor rligons/controversial symbols to meet guidelines.They are rendered as misspellings with some vowels removed.

Edit: For context, I'm a science student! And the post weren't meant to say that more people should persue history as a future career but just to clarify that history is something everyone should learn and not to be thrown to one side. I was frankly just surprised when I realised that you can easily skip learning about WW2 in Singapore, where in most other countries WW2 is a very important topic in middle-high school. Sorry if the post came as to agressive or defensive, I wasn't trying to trigger anyone and I'm sorry for some of my wording which could've been better. But I stand by my point that people should have at least some form of historical knowledge of the world, especially Singaporean history and modern events that shaped todays world.

121,[O Levels] Notes and Tips for English Paper 1 and 2,"**Editing** 

* Don't expect the wrong words to pop up in front of you, scrutinize each and every word with the mentality of ""every word is wrong"", it will be much easier for you to locate errors 

&#x200B;

**Visual Text** 

* What is the intended effect of \_\_\_? 

The repetition of the word/phrase emphasizes that \_\_\_

The use of the word ""now"" invokes a sense of urgency in readers, so that they will quickly \_\_\_   

The use of pronouns (you/your) invokes a sense of responsibility and personal involvement in readers, so that they will be willing to \_\_\_

The use of shocking fact/statistic invokes (sympathy, guilt, excitement, other emotions) in readers, so that they will be more willing to \_\_\_

* Message of the text IS NOT purpose of the text 

Message of the text could be ""Education is important for children"", for which the corresponding purpose would be ""To convince parents to enroll their children in schools"" 

* How does the image support the message of the source?

The image shows \_\_\_\_ , emphasizing that \_\_\_

* Who is the intended audience?

Think : what group of readers can do something to achieve the purpose of the text? 

&#x200B;

**Compre Section B** 

* Language and effect questions : How does the use of language show that \_\_\_\_?

\[""quote phrase"" suggests that \] x 3 or x 2, depending on whether it is 3 or 2 marks

* What is unusual and effective about \_\_\_?

One would expect ""word/phrase"" to mean \_\_\_\_ , but in this case, it is described as ""contrasting word/phrase in the same para or sentence"". 

It is effective as it emphasizes that ... (writer's emotion, personality, thought etc can be anything really) 

* Answer in your own words : paraphrase verbs (actions) and adjectives (pretty, ugly) , DO NOT CHANGE NOUNS (jobs, names)

&#x200B;

**Compre Section C**

* Answer in your own words : paraphrase verbs (actions) and adjectives (pretty, ugly) , DO NOT CHANGE NOUNS (jobs, names)
* How can \_\_\_ support his argument with reference to paragraph X ? Literally just highlight the sentence and re-write it as ""\_\_\_ can support his argument by explaining that \_\_\_""
* Summary Writing :    

ONLY PICK POINTS, NOT EXPLANATIONS 

Answer in your own words : paraphrase verbs (actions) and adjectives (pretty, ugly) , DO NOT CHANGE NOUNS (jobs, names)

Link points together with conjunctions : however, moreover, additionally, and, furthermore, apart from 

IF U CANT PARAPHRASE ANY WORD, JUST CHANGE THE SENTENCE STRUCTURE AND USE CONJUNCTIONS 

for example, if my points are : ""Alcohol gets you lit boiiii"", ""alcohol helps you meet your dead relatives"" and ""drinking alcohol will make you a turbo virgin"", i will rewrite it as : 

""Apart from getting you lit, consuming alcohol will enable you to encounter your deceased relatives and turn you into a Republican.""

REMEMBER TO WRITE THE FINAL WORD COUNT IN THE BOX ON THE NEXT PAGE! FAILURE TO DO SO WILL RESULT IN DEDUCTION OF 1 MARK 

&#x200B;

**Situational Writing** 

* DO NOT LIFT FROM THE INFORMATION PROVIDED IN THE BROCHURE/WEBPAGE/PICTURE, paraphrase and ADD YOUR OWN DETAILS to add vibrance to your story. 
* Write 300-400 words, try not to spend more than 45 minutes on it.
* One paragraph for each bullet point/ required point 
* Remember that your tone is important. If you are writing a formal letter, use ""corporate speak"", so instead of using words such as ""ask"", or ""tell"", you use ""enquire"" and ""inform"". If you are talking to classmates, schoolmates, cca mates in a speech, you can be more relaxed and use rhetorical questions, jokes etc 

&#x200B;

**Continuous Writing** 

* Don't attempt descriptive essays unless you have a wide plethora of flowery and eloquent phrases in your arsenal. 
* For argumentative essays (do you agree?) : 

Para 1 : 

hook - statistic, interesting fact, real or fake quote that is relevant

background info in today's society, people tend to ....

Thesis statement i think that \_\_\_, to a large extent

Para 2, 3, 4 are body paragraphs, each para 1 point

Conclusion : overall view + possible solution + outcome to solution

&#x200B;

* For discursive (discuss adv and disadv, pros and cons) :

Para 1 : 

hook - statistic, interesting fact, real or fake quote that is relevant

background info in today's society, people tend to ....

Thesis statement\_\_ can be a double-edged sword, as it has its benefits and flaws

Para 2, 3 are body paragraphs for pros 

Para 4,5 are body paragraphs for cons

Conclusion : overall view + solution to mitigate cons + outcome to solution

123,[Rant] Parents controlling what you want to study,"Im sure many of you can relate when I say all my life, my parents have dictated what I study. In secondary school, they chose A-Math, pure bio, pure chem, etc. Basically all sciences. In JC, they chose a sciences course too. They did so knowing I am naturally a Humanities student and can't do Math to save my life. 

When I was young, I didn't know I had the option to retaliate, so I just accepted everything.  I thought my parents knew best. Fast forward many disappointing and painful years of working my ass off for subjects I didn't care for, unsurprisingly I did badly for A levels. 

I realized something then. The guilt and disappointment I felt was because I let my parents down. My feelings and mindset of school revolved around my parents. And I realized this was why I hated school and didn't do well, because I wasn't doing it for myself.

By then, I was 18 and finally rebelled against my parents. It was not easy, my parents are strict and traditional Asian parents. but I managed to do it. I threatened that I would drop out of uni if they chose what I studied again. Finally they let me pick a Humanities course I liked.
Now is the happiest I've been in the entirety of my academic life. I didn't know you could enjoy school so much. I went from a F9 student in secondary school to a straight A student in uni. The most satisfying part is showing my parents that they were wrong all along and I knew myself better.

My advice to any young students who are in the same situation is to choose what you want to study. Even if it means rebelling, it could save you a lot of confusion, anguish and disappointment. I envy those of you who had the freedom to choose your path at an early age.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j5ghxu/rant_parents_controlling_what_you_want_to_study/,True,2020-10-06 01:43:55
124,[Rant] The Opinions of Others,"I don't know when I've started to think this way, or why, but I don't actually care about how I score. I care about what my cousins, relatives and even what my parents' colleagues will think. At the end of every important exam, all I hear is: ""how much did your child get?"". And chances are, I didn't score as well, and my parents tell everyone so anyway. I don't even know some of them or have never talked to them, and yet every time I imagine that their response is likely to be pity, or they may even think in their hearts, ""I'm glad my child isn't as stupid as theirs"".

I wish my parents would stop telling all my relatives whatever that happens with me. I visit the psychologist, suddenly all my relatives know and are giving their unwelcome advice on how 'mental illness is fake'. I just want to tell them that I don't need their useless opinion on the matter, but I know if I blow up they'll look at me with pitiful eyes and say, ""children these days are so prone to anger, it's because they've been playing too much violent games.""

I can study so hard for a test, and be told by some smartass ""confirm didn't pay attention in class la"" after failing. Why are people so quick to judge? I know it's just a comment, but these are all small things that build up into frustration and sadness over time, and when I'm not feeling too well, the only thing I flash back to are these.

I'm taking A's now. Next year, I'll hear the same few things: ""how much did your child score?"",Just wanted to get this out. Sorry.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jp3jrd/rant_the_opinions_of_others/,True,2020-11-07 03:32:15

126,[Rant] Stress and worry shall haunt me for the rest of my life,"&#x200B;

Dear Cambridge, thanks for making such great and value-adding examinations. Throughout my past four years studying in my beloved neighbourhood school, I have learnt countless life lessons, such as hiding in my closet whenever I encounter a difficult amath question.  


Dear Cambridge, thanks for realizing to me that suicide is never an option; that pouring what seems like half of my parents' salary into extra math tuition is always an option; that no wonder how many past-year papers I practise, I still will never be able to understand why a log graph has an asymptote.  


Dear SEAB, thanks for removing bellcurve. I think we can all collectively agree that annihilating bell curve off the face of all secondary school students is something that we all truly appreciate! Not having to compete against our peers - who, may I remind you, that I have been with friends for so my entire secondary education - on a mean distribution curve!  


Dear MOE, thanks for introducing CCAs! I totally haven't being oppressed by my fellow CCA members! The feeling of walking home with a depressing thought every day at 6 pm warms my heart. I truly enjoyed every second of my secondary education life, from being ostracized in class, to being made fun of my accent when giving a speech to the whole school.  


I remember waking up one night. I saw my alcoholic father cracking open his 15th wine bottle. I didn't dare to bother questioning what he was doing, for I fully understood how my family's finances were doing. I have 4 other siblings and all of us are PRs. Our education fees do not come cheap - having to foot such a big chunk of our monthly income to pay for an education that's mentally and physically draining is nothing to be elated about. Sure there assistance schemes - but how much do they really help? I doubt my family will stay afloat when I make it to uni - and the constant worry of poverty daunts over my head every night as I lie on my bed and ponder about the future.

Atlas, there's hope. I just need to study my brains out to make it to a prestigious JC - from which I score a 90 RP to earn my place in the highly-sought-after-by-my-parents law course in NUS, and from there I can finally land a high paying job to bring home my family the much forsaken golden rice bowl.

Alright, I shall stop here. Its midnight and I just needed a place to pour my worries. Not that it will go away, of course - that will only happen when I trade my soul to Cambridge.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hcq64o/rant_stress_and_worry_shall_haunt_me_for_the_rest/,True,2020-06-21 09:28:15

128,[Rant] i feel bad for being a jealous friend,"throwaway cos my friend knows my account

i’ll refer my friend as Germaine for this whole rant (name obv changed)

i got my results a week ago and i think i did pretty well and i was quite okay w it! like i felt that i cld have done better but for my first year im personally proud of it. 

so for background info, me and germaine have the same group of friends back in pri n sec sch. but germaine and I have the same interests and we took the same subj combi back in sec sch. so we were obviously very close. and now in jc, we had the same subject combi

germaine is very hardworking and talented in the field that we were both passionate abt (music) i am definitely not as hardworking (quite lazy haiz)

back to present. germaine scored the top of her class with like flying colours and won 1st place for a competition. im definitely very proud of her, but theres this little nagging feeling of jealousy? as friends in the same clique, my other friends wld recognise her for being super good at this field of ours. eg lets say its my friend’s birthday, they wld always go “oh germaine’s good at singing! let her sing the bday song!” uk recognise her skill for little things like this, when i can do it as well. but im nvr recognised for anything bcos she is so good at it compared to me. it sounds rlly minor like oh just this only then u complain but no. everyone, my friends, family, teachers, all praise her and my family wld always compare her to me. 

i tried to push away this jealously that i feel bcos 1. she put in sm effort therefore she gets good results so obviously me being lazier this is what i get. u reap what u sow. 2. germaine is the sweetest human being alive. how can i hate her? 

i am definitely very proud of her, no lie. but also i wld be lying if i said i wasnt jealous. and i hate myself for feeling this way. this is probably just a rant but feel free to leave advice. 

if i ever told this to anyone they wld prbly go aiya liddat only then work harder la be better than her la. 

haiz i just feel like im always second choice. ive learnt to accept it but it doesnt mean that it doesnt hurt when it happens.


edit: some ppl have assumed that this jealously would grow and i might destroy our friendship. like i said, we have been friends since primary school. a decade of friendship. we have been thru thick and thin. this jealously has been quite bad at the start of our friendship, but over the years it just kinda faded. im not saying that its completely gone (its still there) but i wld be a fool to let jealously take over me and destroy our friendship. its been years lol i have time to control it. but i was feeling stressed these days and just wanted to let it out. thanks for all the kind words of encouragement and helpful advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j1wqft/rant_i_feel_bad_for_being_a_jealous_friend/,True,2020-09-30 02:33:56

131,[Rant] 新加坡学生的华语程度,"首先这篇帖子并不是什么慷慨陈词，只是没有更好的flair. 

！注意：请抱歉发帖者的三分华文 

从中学开始，发现我许多的同学华文程度真的不行。读写别说，连听说都烂。此时觉得很奇怪，明明是华人，在华校，但华文说不出口??? 一到初级学院，发现次情况更加严重。有些人还拿不会华文当比赛!? 

最遗憾的是，在本校的开院天，我带一对中国父母在校内介绍，结束后他们竟然对我说：欸，以新加坡人的程度你华语还挺不赖的。顿时傻了（参观时忘了图书馆的华语......) 

其实我真的后悔自己的华语没学好，上课时嬉戏瞌睡，吊儿郎当。后来真的觉得自己没文化，才去自己奋力提高华文水平。但看到不珍惜双语教育的机会的人，感到惋惜。希望当亚洲崛起时，更多的星国人会重视华语｡

132,[Uni] Anyone here went for a course they didn’t exactly like? How was it?,"Few categories of people I’m directing my questions to:

1) Those who joined their course because of the high pay and good job prospects, but didn’t exactly have a passion for it (for example, law)

2) Those who joined because of the hype and rising popularity (for example, CS)

3) Those who didn’t know what to do with their lives and chose a general course (for example, business)

4) Those who did badly for A levels, but want to enter university regardless of course because they are unwilling to retake (I won’t mention examples)

5) Any other reasons such as parents, friends etc.

Do state your course/uni and which category you belong to! 

Questions:

1) How are you coping academically? Do you struggle to keep up with content you didn’t have much interest in? Or did you end up liking your course?

2) How is your relative performance to your cohort? Is it true that passion and interest determines aptitude, or can anyone who works hard do well?

3) Do you regret your choice, and why? Given another chance, would you have chosen differently?

4) Any other advice for people who are in the same situation as you?

Am just asking out of genuine curiosity. I know that interest and passion should be of upmost priority when choosing courses, but I’m sure there are people out there that chose their courses for other reasons.

* The school that had the most ***no.*** of courses with **increases** is *Business & Management* at *17* (*37.78%* of *45* total courses under the school).
* The school that had the largest ***percentage*** of total no. of courses with **increases** is *Built Enviroment* at *54.55%* (*6* out of *11* total courses under the school).
* The school that had the most ***no.*** of courses with **decreases** is *Engineering* at *20* (*52.63%* of *38* total courses under the school).
* The school that had the largest ***percentage*** of total no. of courses with **decreases** is *Information & Digital Technologies* at *65.38%* (*17* out of *26* total courses under the school).
* The single course with the biggest change in points is *Environmental Science* at RP, going from 26 to 19, a change of *7* points. It also earns the title of largest point **decrease**.
* The single course with the biggest point **increase** is actually a tie, going to *Engineering Systems & Management* at RP (21 to 26) and *Interior Design* at SP (11 to 16), both having an increase of *5* points.

\*The *Humanities* and *Maritime Studies* schools only have *5* courses each among all the Polytechnics, significantly less than all other schools.

Conclusions:

In general, polytechnics are getting slightly harder to get into as nearly *50%* of all courses have raised the bar for acceptance (actual percentage \~45%). NYP especially as *28* of its courses **decreased** in scores while only a measly *2* **increased**.

As for schools, when looking at ***raw numbers***, it seems as if less people are going to *Business & Management* courses, hence the reason for why many of them have **increased** in scores, and the **reverse** is true for *Engineering* courses. However, it should be noted that the schools of *Business & Management* and *Engineering* have the most ***no.*** of courses at *45* and *38* respectively, thus it is actually a bit unfair to say that, as a whole, these schools are going in a particular trend, especially when the numbers make up a small ***percentage***.

When looking at ***percentages*** instead, the opposite problem is true for *Built Enviroment*, where the total ***no.*** of courses is too small. However, I do believe it is fair to say that most *Information & Digital Technologies* courses are getting harder to get into, as *26* total courses is quite a sizable sample size, especially considering the average number of courses per school.

134,[O Levels] Moving on from A Maths P2 (Applies to other papers too),"What’s done cannot be undone. The moment the exam ended and you placed your pen down, there’s nothing more you can do about it. Of course, it’s very understandable that you would like to rant about it in order to let some steam off and relieve some of your stresses. But, it’s going to be very bad for you when you keep harping on this single issue and refusing to move on. That is going to affect your feelings and revision for other subjects and ultimately, your performance for the remaining papers. All you are going to think about is how many marks you have lost, whether you can do well etc. These negative feelings and thoughts in your mind are going to obstruct your revision for other subjects. You are going to find difficulty in trying to absorb and retain information in your brain if you continue to dwell on this issue. If you let this continue, it’s going to end up as a vicious cycle. Today, you are affected by your A Maths paper, tomorrow, you are affected by your Chemistry and Geography paper and so on. Do not let your feelings for a certain paper affect your revision and performance for subsequent papers. IT’S JUST NOT WORTH IT. At the most, spend a short time complaining about it and then MOVE ON. 

While you can’t change the past, you have the ability to change the future (OR the outcome of things at least). It all depends on you and whether you have the correct mindset to do so. In our academic lives, there are going to be many more papers like A Math P2 that we will encounter. So, try to take something positive out of this negative experience and use it as a motivating factor to push yourself for the remaining papers instead of letting the past buckle you down. I’m sure many of you are able to do this! IT’S ALL UP TO YOU!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jiceo2/o_levels_moving_on_from_a_maths_p2_applies_to/,True,2020-10-27 02:53:33
135,Something about getting a B for PW is so freeing [A Levels],"Yes, I got a B for PW (most of my classmates got that too, haiz). I'm not really going to mull over the usual points like how 1.25 rp don't mean much, it's just a H1, etc. I believe most of us knew that already.

I was joking with my friends that 'my dreams of getting 90 rp is gone'. But, come to think of it, there's something quite liberating about not getting the 'perfect score'. 

I guess I have struggled with feelings of 'perfectionism', where everything (this being every subject) must be at its best (like a distinction). If not, I'm not good enough. There's this stress that I put onto myself to have all the A's. And yet, getting a B for PW made me realise that it's quite freeing to not be pressured with the expectations of 'making everything perfect'. It's saying that 'I can make mistakes, it doesn't mean I will fail in the end'.

Imagine if I got an A. I might feel the need to ensure everything else is an A. That might cause quite a lot of stress, especially since I'm right now studying for my other subjects that are worth more points than PW.

It's just my 2 cents on this topic. My view might be quite the opposite of what most people would perceive. But, if you've struggled with this 'black and white' thinking, where if you slip a bit, you would consider yourself a failure, maybe this is a form of encouragement for you. 

Now, does this mean I will slack off for my other subjects? No. I will still work hard to score well for them. Likewise, for those taking PW right now, it doesn't mean you should slack off. It's just that now, you'll have this thing at the back of your head that tells you that 'if all else fails, at least you have tried'. That, in the end, is what truly matters. 

Bye to my dream of '90 rank points', I don't need that label to prove my worth anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gbddbs/something_about_getting_a_b_for_pw_is_so_freeing/,True,2020-05-01 22:57:41

137,[University] i feel like a failure,"I'll be frank, i went to YIJC so i really don't know what i was expecting in terms of results. I'm not gonna sit here and say YIJC is a shitshow of a school (but 2019 mean r was 61.25rp) and all their students are bad, i know many people of my 2019 batch who made it into NUS and all that. It's not really about the school, its about the people. The teachers, the friends u have and ofc you. I came from a neighbourhood sec sch and was in the last class of express. I actually had many friends who didn't even continue with tertiary  edu, so to them i was alr damn smart for getting into a JC and not retaining in J1. My parents went to poly, did it part time as they worked so tbh, i went to JC for them. Not that i was eyeing anyth in poly so i didn't rlly mind la. 

But i legit feel like i let everyone down. i'm now gg to priv uni (PSB) i did rlly bad for A Lvls (63rp) i applied to all the local uni but obv im rejected so anyways. i kinda didn't want to go to SIM bcos ik people gg thr and lowkey? embarrassed. like idt people expected me to fail so badly which just adds to the this sinking feeling in my gut that im a big fat fucking failure. idt people think that i am just bcos i went to priv uni but i feel like being unmotivated to study all the damn time in JC just became my undoing like wow my one small mistake of not mugging costs me about 47k and literally my future. I always wanted to go to a good uni for my friends who didn't complete their schooling, for my family members that never made it and ofc for myself (dorm seems so fun!!) but yea who would've thought one exam that i fked up caused me my entire life :"")

If ur an A Lvl kid reading this for god knows what reason, pls get some inspo somewhr, get off reddit insta tiktok wtv and pls just mug prelims coming up right? AHAHAHA u gots this, don't lose hope and don't stop studying.

138,[RANT] Bullying in Schools,"In Sec 3 i made a fateful decision to study the subjects i'm interested in instead of following my friends from Sec 2 to the same class and this has changed my life in ways i couldn't have imagine then. As a result of changing class in sec 3, i had almost no friends in class therefore i had to make new friends which i initially thought that it was no big deal. However, my sec 3 class formed many cliques or their own and i wasn't able to join any of those clique simply because i wasn't cool enough or smart enough for them. Therefore i'm one of the fringe loser in class who is the bottom of social hierarchy (ones that have no friends to eat lunch with) that got picked on and bullied by those in their clique. It was a difficult moment for me and it caused me to lose interest in my studies at that time and i turned to playing football to escape my reality. Soon my O level approaches and i realized that i'm not going to make it and do well for O's if this continues. After taking my A Math prelim paper (knowing that i did very badly and that i could do much better) i immediately walked to my school vice principal office to seek an audience with her and asked for permission from the school to allow me to retain in sec 4 and take my O's in the following year. Thankfully i was allowed to do so after getting my parents permission and i took my O's the following year and made it to JC. In JC, i studied my ass off and worked really hard even though in the end my A level result wasn't great or reflective of the amount of work i put in, i still managed to enter a local uni. Now fast forward 2yrs of NS, i'm starting Uni soon in 11 Aug and as i looked back i realized that things might had played out very differently had i followed my friends in sec 2 to the same class in sec 3. I still might be in touch with them and i won't be bullied in Sec 3 or retained a year. Sometimes i wonder how are those bullies doing in life now, whether are they still as miserable as then or have they changed their ways and treat people more decently. Maybe i won't be able to meet them ever again but they sure once made a huge impact to my life. Therefore i hope that schools can do more to help students against bullying to prevent more kids like me being affected by it, as bullying can have a huge impact to the childhood of students.

139,[Rant] Withdrawing from JC might be my biggest regret,"
This is going to be all over the place because, well, I am all over the place as well ha so I apologise for any brain cells that you may lose after reading my rant. 

Basically, I withdrew from jc just weeks in, without giving myself time to adjust and let fear drive me away. I’m in poly now, just floating in a sea inferiority. 

Poly life for me is like drinking lukewarm water. The difficult and stressful times are then like eating something so spicy you don’t taste anything anymore. All you feel is your tongue burning, no flavor, nothing, just a one dimensional feeling. That’s it. That’s all I’ve been feeling for the past three semesters and there’s no in between.

I’ve come to realise that in poly I haven’t gotten the chance to actually fully spread my wings and take that leap of faith to try and fly, and to be very honest, I don’t think I ever will. Sure, if I can’t try to fly then I probably won’t ever fall and land on my face but is that really what I want? Do I really just want to stay stagnant and not grow from failure? (Sounds ironic because I guess you could say this whole rant describes my one big failure.) My journey in poly is half over and yet I still feel unfulfilled academically and holistically. I can’t seem to find any opportunities to grow and develop myself into a better me or push me to be the best version of myself which was readily available in the jc I was in. In addition, despite paying 1.5k a semester, I also feel like the resources we get are lacking more often than not. I feel so insecure even when poly is supposed to be more specialised in the sense that you learn stuff about the field you’ve chosen a lot more in depth than you could’ve in jc. But nope. I feel like everything single thing I learn is so haphazard and incomplete. It’s like yeah we may know a lot but it’s all surface knowledge and definitely not enough to fully grasp or internalise the concepts. 

I always tell myself that hey you left jc to pursue something you wanted.(In hindsight, something I thought I wanted.) But, as explained above, yeah that’s just to make myself feel better. I honestly do not know if what I’ve learnt and will be learning in poly is worth missing out on all the other stuff I would’ve learnt if I stayed in jc. I also know deep down that the real reason I left was because I was terrified. I was a wuss who ran away the first chance I got. 

Also, no, I am in no way looking down on my fellow poly kids. Y’all are like amazing having to go through tons of submissions every semester no matter which school and course you’re in and especially last semester given HBL. Not to mention that whole cumulative gpa shit. One mishap and were basically dead. Screw anyone who tries to belittle you when you talk about how stressed you are and some elitist jc imbecile goes oh you haven’t experienced real stress because you aren’t taking A levels. 

I’m feeling all this just because I happened to see all my jc friends celebrating their grad day today. It’s like a reminder: hey this is what you could’ve experienced, what you would’ve experienced if you stood your ground, bit the bullet and stayed in jc. This was the community you could’ve been part of. This was the experience you deprived yourself of by running away. I wouldn’t say it’s fomo but fomo amplified exponentially. Every story I see of my jc friends is a constant reminder of everything I’ve missed out on just because I was scared in the beginning. All these experiences I’ve witnessed, both the good and the bad, I’ve never and probably will never experience where I am now and that sucks. Sure I have friends and I am so grateful for them. But they’re neither the kind of friends I had back in secondary school nor the type of friends I made in jc or those my friends have made. Seeing them sticking it out through thick and thin together makes me so glad that my friends are lucky enough to have such a strong support system that A levels have nothing on but also it makes me feel so regretful that that was the kind of community I gave up when I left my jc because no such system exists where I am now. The journey I’m going through in poly feels like a very lonely battle that I have to fight on my own without anyone to back me up or anyone to rely on. It gets kinda lonely. With all that, sometimes I just go: damn I really missed out on a lot huh. Of course, the grass is always greener on the other side but I really can’t help but feel this way. 

It probably sounds like I’m being a little bitch and complaining like a child. I can see that yes I understand so I’m not usually like this. It’s been months which is why I’d like to think I’ve gotten over everything and am only looking forward. It rarely rains I guess. I really kinda do feel dead inside. However, when it does rain, it pours. 

I know there’s no one else to blame but myself. I know that it’s no one else’s fault but my own. And I also know no one is harder on me about all this than myself which sucks. It really does suck that I beat myself up over and over again about the same thing even when it’s been months. I, more than anyone else, would like to just put everything that’s happened in the past but I can’t seem to. I try my very best to shove all these feelings down my throat and swallow it but ever so often I just throw it all back up, making a huge mess that I have to clean up. It’s one endless vicious cycle that I can’t escape. 

One good thing that came out from all of this is that when I realised I may have made a mistake, I tried to rectify it. Although that mistake wasn’t actually rectified, I take comfort in the fact that I already did try my best so no regrets about that. When I tell myself that however, it eventually leads to my brain saying well if you think about it you wouldn’t have had to rectify your mistake if you didn’t make the mistake in the first place. And we’re back to square one. 

As of now, I’d say withdrawing from jc might be my biggest regret. It has created such an overwhelming sense of inferiority in me that will probably follow me for the rest of my life. Praying and hoping that one day I get over it. 

So yeah that’s about it.

Nonetheless, to all J2s, happy grad! 🥳 All the best for As! Y’all got this💪🏼",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j7uyz0/rant_withdrawing_from_jc_might_be_my_biggest/,True,2020-10-09 23:59:59
140,[A Levels] [JC] My story of Poly to JC. Then Retaking A Levels in NS.,"This is the story of the certain unconventional paths that I took over the past few years. Although there were many twists and turns along the way, I still managed to reach my destination in the end. In such an uncertain world, I hope anyone reading my experience can find some inspiration in it – whether you are uncertain about something; planning to do something out of the norm; doing what you feel is best for you etc.

**Brief Background**

· Was in Poly for one year in 2016, scored 3.7 GPA

· Dropped out to go JC in 2017

· Scored 67.5rp in 2018 A Levels

· Self-studied during NS and scored 77.5rp in 2019 A Levels

**Poly to JC**

As the months went by in Poly, first year me just felt like I had taken the wrong route. Within my sec school clique, I was the only one who went to Poly while the others had gone to JC. They constantly complained about their hectic school life and unending homework to me, so you would think that I would be content with choosing Poly, where first year was still manageable. Furthermore, my results were decent, and I was 3rd in my class with a GPA of 3.7. But no. I was not content at all. JC – with its academic rigour and more structured environment – just appealed to me more. It was a huge dilemma as I did not know if “the grass just seemed greener on the other side”. Finally, after months of deliberation, I finally handed in my Poly drop-out forms at start-2017 and enrolled into JC, taking the Arts combi of H2 Geog, Econs, Lit and H1 Math.

I gotta be honest, I was terrified that I had made the wrong choice, as many I had consulted (esp my friends alr in JC) had discouraged me. They said that it was pure craziness to go JC; that they hated the lifestyle and they were sure I would feel the same in no time. Looking back, I absolutely loved it (they still hate it lmao). I really miss my caring teachers; the canteen stall aunties that gave the place a homely feel; and ofc hanging out with my friends. My class had very few guys, so I hung out in a mostly girls clique which was a new and interesting experience, as my friends in the past were usually guys.

On the academic side, I love the subjects I was taking and worked hard for them in JC1, which allowed me to have one of the better scores in class. At that point of time, complacency had set in and I thought, “I’m set for JC alr”. That was ultimately my undoing. Complacency, coupled with an overly unhealthy obsession with working out (spent my days watching fitness videos and at the gym, instead of studying), led to my first set of JC2 test results being a huge disappointment. When Prelims came around, I either failed or had a borderline pass in all my subjects and placed near the bottom of my class. I only came to my senses around that time and started to consult my teachers and study intensively for the *first* time in JC2. It was of course, too little, and too late, and I got 67.5rp for the 2018 A Levels. It was expected – I was so underprepared that I was even reading parts of my Lit texts for the *first* time during the actual papers! When I received my dismal results, I was clueless and filled with regret. I had just booked out from Tekong, and was tired from having completed my field camp, and simply went home in a daze. The only thing I thought as I went home was “What now? The uni courses I want sure would reject me.”

**Retaking A Levels in NS**

For many of the JC students out there, I believe that most of us like to joke about retaking the A Levels during our JC days (e.g. if our school tests are bad, we’ll just say “eh nvm la, repeat or retake A Lvls only”). After reflecting over my disappointing results, that choice became something I seriously considered. That was one of the lowest points in my life so far, but I knew deep down that there was something more, and that my poor results could not simply be the end of the road for me. I knew I wanted to retake the A Levels to prove I had not wasted my time coming to JC. 

At that time, almost everyone discouraged me from retaking, saying that “Why should you put yourself through the stress of A’s again?”, “how would you be able to juggle NS and studying in camp (I’m a stay-in personnel and camp isn’t exactly conducive for studying)”, or “where would you get help from since you can’t retake in school?”. I’m grateful for their concerns as they genuinely did not want me to retake only to get abysmal results again, esp with stories of retakes normally improving minimally or even getting worser scores. Despite their well-meaning concern, my yearning for another attempt to prove myself was too strong, and I applied for the 2019 A Levels as a private candidate in March.

However, in Apr and May 2019, I started receiving replies from the universities. While SMU and NUS rejected me, NTU miraculously offered me Econs at the last moment. Although I accepted it and could have gotten a full refund for the A Levels from SEAB had I wanted to (SEAB allowed for a refund if you show them the uni offer and decide not to take the A Lvls), I was still determined to retake no matter what as I knew that not doing so would be a source of regret in my future – I did not want to look back and think about the kind of results I could have gotten. Furthermore, I knew that studying Econs at a uni level was markedly different from doing it at JC, and was not something I was interested in. Having made a full commitment to retaking, I dived into my books and vowed that the following year, I would be choosing the courses I want, not letting them choose me!

From then on till the A Levels in Nov 2019, I find it quite ironic that I actually studied more during those few months than my entire JC2 period. Any free time in NS, bam, I would be studying and putting in my 100%. Throughout my studying, it did not matter the excuses I may have conjured up, I simply grinded on. No teacher to help me since I self-studying? I simply took on that role and marked my own work, leaving no stone unturned. No confidence in my content? I simply re-read my notes again and again until I got it. My mindset was quite simple, which was that I was not going to let all these hindrances prevent me from reaching my goal, because they were just excuses at the end of the day. Whenever I felt demotivated, I would think back to results day – how hopeless I had felt – and be reminded about how I did not want to feel that way again on 2020 results day.

When Nov came around and the A levels started, oh boy was I nervous. My heart was pounding as I entered the exam hall I was assigned to in my outside clothes along with the JC2 students in school uniform. You’d think the second time would be less scarier, but it seemed even more intimidating sitting in the exam hall again as I was well aware of the stakes now – I had to make sure my intensive studying would pay off. As I did the papers, I realised that I was more confident in answering the questions than my previous A Level attempt as I had prepared for many of the questions! It was honestly quite satisfying feeling like that. For my Lit paper, I was finally familiar with the texts this time round, compared with the last time HAHA!

When Feb came finally, I was really nervous the night before the release of the results that I had tossed and turned in my bed. A lot of people were messaging asking me about my results too, and I really did not want to disappoint them and myself. When I opened my results and calculated my rank points – 77.5, it felt surreal and all I could think of it “Had I made a mistake in calculating my results?”. After many recalculations and it was still 77.5, the reality sinked in. I had done it! I had the biggest grin on my face as I realised that my efforts had paid off. Although it may not be 90rp, I was proud of my efforts as my 77.5rp represented all the effort I had to put in during this journey. It was not the grades at the end, but the better person I had become through this journey that was most valuable to me.

**My biggest takeaway from my journey**

Follow your heart with confidence. Even if there are tough challenges of the path you’re taking, face it head-on because what’s the worst that could happen? No matter if you fail or succeed, you’ll come out being a better person than before. Go for it and don't look back!

141,[A Levels] Pls read this after 3pm on 21 Feb 2020,"Just a letter to myself and whoever who can't sleep hahaha! 

Hey! You would have known your results by now. Here's what I've got to tell you, I'm you, the night before, anxious but still rational. 

If you have done well or exceeded your own expectations, congrats! Enjoy the day, remember to thank Daddy, mummy and everyone who have supported you till this far. You did not achieve any of this solely based on your on merits. They have provided immensely for you emotionally and physically. Don't be too arrogant tho, you ain't the very smart one and you know it. Remember, you have just moved onto a new chapter of your life. Work hard in uni pls. Don't forget how you have suffered in j2, all the nights you cried, the days you wanted everything to come to an end. I'm glad you pushed through but let me warn you, if you repeat that unmotivated, ill-disciplined habit of yours, everything in j2 will repeat in uni finals :) Good luck then. But deep down, I have faith in you, from how you have changed over the past 2 months after As. So don't disappoint me anymore.


If you screwed up, fortunately or unfortunately, happy or sad, just move on. You know what you have been through in 2019, your progress means more than anything else. Yes, you may have disappointed everyone but remember, you were almost about to give up a week before 4th Nov! But u didn't! I'm proud of you for that!


Also, I'm pretty glad that you have spent the months after As meaningfully. You experienced what the working life is, tried working 12hours shift, invested time and effort into changing your lifestyle to a even better one, and being physically and mentally healthier is your greatest achievement for yourself! Also something very important is that you are so much more disciplined now! Thank you very much for that.

Anyways, you have mapped out the options beforehand, so just cool down, think rationally and make an informed choice! Being successful in life takes luck, connection and hard work! Not just the grades you see now. Also, just a reminder to you, I know you have tried moving on, but deep down you still love him. But... don't go back to him pls, you need to be independent! Remember, regardless of your results, you are a independent woman now and I thank you for that. 


Love,
Myself!

How do I sit down and eat a cake with my siblings knowing I've failed them. I don't want to go home.

But I will, eventually. I brainwashed myself into thinking things will be alright. That's how I laughed and joked about my results to bring up my classmate's mood.

So... How do I tell my parents I failed?

143,[A Levels] the vicious cycle of underperforming.,"I feel absolutely lost and I really don't know what the fuck to do now. 

I didn't do badly, but I didn't do very well either - which fucking sucks, given the amount of effort that I had put into my studies. I would call myself a person who believes in hard work and consistency - I've been studying really hard even during J1 year, and that didn't stop into J2 year. So what went wrong? I'm honestly so fucking sick of seeing people who fool around a lot or only begin to cram at the very last minute always perform better than myself - it seems like it's been a common occurence since secondary school. My O level results weren't bad, but they weren't that great, either - I really hate that I have failed to make that change for my A level. This applied even for the SAT test that I took the last year - I did so many practice tests and studied so rigorously, only to end up falling short again, caught in between the good and the bad. I hate feeling so fucking disappointed in myself over and over again. I hate that I'm seeing the same pattern repeat itself over and over again. I have another test that I'd signed up for in a few months' time, one that I've been working really hard for -  I've been trying to move on and keep my mind of yesterday, but my feeling of self-doubt and self-hatred has been relentlessly thrumming in my mind and keeping me up all night - I'm honestly so terrified to see myself fall short again. It's becoming a recurring trend that I can't seem to have control over, one that I can't seem to change.

I know that I'm not stupid - I have a lot of interests, I can pick up and do a lot of things, I know how to work my way around things, I do alright on block tests. I'm a runner, I'm a dancer, I'm an artist, I'm a writer, I'm a violinist, I like animals and volunteering at animal shelters, I like singing and listening to music  So what is wrong with me? I used to think of myself as a relatively academic person, though definitely less so in the recent years - well, I guess I never really knew myself after all. After seeing my results yesterday, I know that I'll have a very low chance for getting a scholarship - I didn't think it was necessary nor did I need to hear it to know, but here's what my father scoffed at me yesterday, reiterating my worst fears - ""Yeah, you try to apply with these kind of scores, see who wants you???"" It was very unlike him, making it especially disheartening and heart-wrenching to hear coming from him. I later overheard him telling my mum, ""We give her so many thing and so many resources and she still can produce these kind of results???"" and I honestly feel really, really bad - like, I'm sorry that I'm not good enough, I'm sorry that I'm constantly disappointing you over and over again, I'm sorry that I can never seem to be an ideal daughter that you can be proud of. I think that he hates me now, but I really don't blame him at all - it's true that he and the rest of my family has given me so much, in terms of love and support - and all I've done is let them down over and over again. It really fucking sucks that I never seem to be able to break out of this vicious cycle of me constantly underperforming even though I have the potential to do better - I don't blame him at all. I completely understand how he feels - I do hate myself too.

I'm doing an internship right now, one which leads up to a potential scholarship, but even though the company has reassured us that grades do not matter that much, I know that deep down, they do and it's something they're definitely scrutinising - I'm pretty sure my grades has already put me at a severe disadvantage alongside all the other better and smarter candidates, and that it won't be long before I'm completely kicked off the list. On another note, I've been having doubts about a career here as well, which would me mandatory should I be offered and accept a scholarship from this company - I feel stifled sometimes by the traditional and conservative way of things. So I'm honestly stuck and conflicted about what to do now - should I just stay on for the sake of gaining more internship experience and just see how it goes with the scholarship? Or should I just leave already and do something else sincr I already know that I'm already at a disadvantage as compared to my amazing friends?

Even though I have done well enough to enter quite a few university courses, I'm honestly considering taking a break from academics to work for two years and earn money to fund my own university education - I'm so done with the Singaporean education system and I really do think that I need a breather sometimes. I cannot count the number of times that I have relapsed into bouts of depressive and suicidal thoughts rife with self-hatred and self-deprecation, into bouts of panic attacks in the school toilets, into night terrors or insomnia that keeps me up awake throughout my JC life - I'm really scared that this, akin to my constant inability to perform up to expectations even though I know deep down that I have it in me, would as well become a recurring pattern that would haunt me into adulthood - I feel like I have the right now be selfish and do things my way for once. To not follow the conventional route and way of things, the one that our society has engineeered each and every one of us to gear towards - I want to be in control instead of being controlled for once. 

So sorry for the really long rant, but I honestly can't keep it to myself and hope to know if there's anyone out there who can relate and feel something similar. I've never been an expressive or emotional person in real life, so it's really difficult for me to pour out my heartfelt thoughts and feelings to anyone in real life - it's so uncomfortable for me. So, here I am, pouring them out in the form of words to strangers here on Reddit - hoping to know that I'm not alone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7oywv/a_levels_the_vicious_cycle_of_underperforming/,True,2020-02-22 22:45:33

147,[Uni] Treatment disparity between siblings,"I come from a minority ethnic group that culturally has low emphasis on education. 

This has naturally led me to have poor performance up till secondary 4. I barely scrape through and got into the “worst” poly aka ITE North.

My ex gf left me before Polytechnic start. Instead of dwelling in self pity, my anger turned into determination (that has benefited me ever since)

I flourished in “ITE North” and earned a place at NTU.

I have an elder brother who had also gone through a similar route.

Except - he wasn’t motivated, he liked the idea of being a Doctor but I doubt he knows what it means to be one. He graduated with a GPA of 2.5/4.0 (for you JC students, that’s a C+ average)

My Parents supported his groundless aspiration. They have set aside $600,000 SGD for his medical training and education at a lesser known (but recognised by Singapore Medical Council) University. 

Here’s my problem. 

Throughout Polytechnic, I didn’t have a study table. In fact, I spent most of my time at the School library to study. 

When I brought up the fact that I wanted to have my own dorm at NTU

They WERE AGAINST IT! They said that I was spending money unnecessarily. (We live at the eastern side of Singapore. It takes 3 fucking hours to go back and fourth to NTU)

Given the fact that my minority group has University subsidy benefits (50%)

my entire 4 years (without dorm) would cost 16k - With Dorm, perhaps 32 k. I even said that I’d be able to pay them back.

I just feel angry. Throughout my childhood, my brother and I never clicked. I’ve always been through a lot of things alone. I’d never say or do anything that would worry my parents. 

In fact, working my ass off to get into a local University so that my parents didn’t need to spend a large sum of money to get me educated overseas. I am grateful to them for giving me an opportunity to experience a world class education.

But the fact that they started talking about MONEY.

600k for older brother // less than 40 k for me

I’ve proven myself and he has not. Invest in me today and I’ll be able to repay you many times back.

It pisses me even more when I know that he’s clearly not capable of being a Doctor. He didn’t have the drive in Singapore why would he able to push through the rigorous academic standards of medical school? He doesn’t even bother learning about anything. 

My gut tells me he’s going to waste my parents money. My parents are blinded by love and favouritism to even think objectively.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hzkxg2/uni_treatment_disparity_between_siblings/,True,2020-07-29 11:15:02
148,[poly] dealing with HBL stress,"I know many y1s are S T R E S S E D & i’d like to remind people to stay patient with the whole HBL process & that you’re not alone! Your lecturer is suffering with you :D
Being a y1 student in NP, I know how frustrating it is to have HBL for classes random meetup timings & confusing emails (+ the stress & awkwardness of meeting new people online) but we gotta remind ourselves that our teachers are probably under as much or more stress as we are. 
My father is a lecturer at NYP for Engineering & he’s highkey a b**mer. He’s not really a tech guy. I always see him recording & doing prep work for the class. he’s struggling with the changes. He would feel so upset over ‘small’ matters such as the audio not being 100% in sync with the video etc. He’s more quick to be irritated nowadays but i know he really means well. All he wants is the best for his students & I feel like every lecturer out there feels the same. So please be nice to the teachers & don’t judge them too quickly. Hope everyone has a good day ahead :D

149,[Rant] just some thoughts," think we've all heard about the flaws of our education system. and despite current efforts, i don't think many of us expect it to change anytime soon. this post isn't to give you guys an intellectual breakdown of why our education system sucks, instead these are my visceral, raw emotions and opinions that i have accumulated over these past few years.

i'm honestly exhausted more than anything. literally all my energy is sapped that there is little left for me to protest change. maybe this is the goal of the system. to have us so tightly wrapped around their finger that we can't even think or have the ability to challenge them. yeah, meritocracy is flawed and my school system is flawed. yet, i have benefitted from it and i also have nowhere else to go. since young society has conditioned me to just care about my grades, and now gone are my childhood days where i actually had the freedom and time to spend it on my hobbies and things i like doing. now, i don't have any talents beside studying and mugging to fall back on if i choose not to follow with the predestined journey our country's education system has designed for us.

but as a result i've grown into an apathetic and unhappy person. coming from a low-income family i used to be extremely critical of our education system and parentocracy. and yet when i benefit from this system it silences me because, if it works for me, what reason does it give me to challenge it? and yet in doing so i perpetuate the cycle of inequality and poverty and i have failed my younger counterparts who might not have been as lucky as me. our education system has taught me to be a conformist and to be apathetic towards social issues. yes subjects like GP encourage us to be more critical towards the system we live in but really all this translates into is wonderful fancy essays and writing but no action. employers don't look at how compassionate we are and how hardworking we are, no, it all boils down to our academic credentials. (yes i know this is a sweeping statement but please try to convince me otherwise).

i just feel very hopeless because i hate this system so much and yet i'm so deeply embedded in it that i can't get out. the costs will be too high. i don't know what i intended to get from this post and i'm way too tired to try to expand this into a fruitful discussion but i really hope i'm not alone in feeling the futility of this whole situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hb3ekr/rant_just_some_thoughts/,True,2020-06-18 16:02:38
150,[Rant] [O Levels] The Negative Stigma surrounding Unrealistic Expectations,"hey all, as o's looms closer and closer and many of us are panicking over this exam, i wanna take some time to vomit out what ive taken away from this horrifying experience of prepping for o's.

i see many people here pushing themselves to the brink of insanity and the sheer pressure they put on themselves. there is a strong weightage to do well in this exam, and many of my peers shoot for the sky with L1R4s of 8s and 9s. thats great that you wanna aim high! but id like to remind you that grades DO NOT define you. no matter what anyone tells you, be it parents, teachers, heck you yourself, that number on that piece of paper IS NOT YOU. i dislike seeing people demoralise themselves for doing less than expected. why not look at it from a different angle? instead of a ""i got B3..."", why not try ""hey! i got a b3!"" it does wonders when you look at things in a more positive light, as it pushes you to do even better for the next one. i myself am not a top scorer, im more on the lazy side tbh, and i got L1R4 of 22 for prelims. i aim for an L1R4 of 15 for o's, and low as it may seem, i work within my limits. i know this is the most realistic and highest standard my level of knowledge will take me, and it makes the task seem less daunting as the bar isnt so high up. the real magic comes when you set your expectations realistically, taking into account how it affects your social life, and your mental and physical health.

i can see in my friend group that some of them are losing their shit over this, and its more apparent here. the most common occurence of this weakened mental strength is due to the unrealistic expectations they put on themselves. take me for eg, im a lazy bum who would while away an entire week doing nothing but playing games. is it possible for me to get A1 for all subjs? can. but at what cost? i'd have to muster up 1000% of my energy into learning these useless topics and toss my life out the window just to see a good number on a sheet of paper. you could retaliate, ""there is no choice in sg, do well now to do well in the future."" while i agree with this statement, is it worth pushing your mind to the extreme? i think not. the stigma that we are competing with the whole of sg and bell curves shouldnt be this aggressive in the first place. why not worry about yourself first? 

healthy competition exists to push us to do better. but when its taken too far by external pressures eg. teachers, etc. it creates a domino effect and WE start having that mindset. what began as a seemingly harmless method of getting students to do well is now what makes them go crazy. so i urge everyone, its still not too late to change up your expectations. you can aim high, but is it within your limitations? do you have to sacrifice your social life and mental health? i urge everyone here to think through this carefully, for your own sake. it sucks to see so many ppl in my cohort burning away their lives for one exam.

with that i close this post. while hefty to read, i assure you that if you change up your actions now, things will look up. regain control of your life and dont let this seemingly daunting exam crush your efforts in other aspects of life now. if you need someone to vent to, this subreddit is the perfect place, and if its too public, shoot me a dm. id be more than happy to hear you out. 

tl;dr negative stigma of unrealistic expectations ruining mental health of students, small reminder that it isn't too late to reset and aim at a realistic place without sacrificing everything. also that im here for u, if u need someone to talk to, im here.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jc3x91/rant_o_levels_the_negative_stigma_surrounding/,True,2020-10-16 21:19:46

I’m currently year 1 in a jc, and it’s honestly one of the better ones(in terms of scores I guess) and I have decided to write this in hope that this gives the o level students this year some confidence.(including my younger sister who is taking o levels this year)

Honestly, my results were trash, I’m not joking, it was bad. My L1R5 score in Sec 3 was 35 points and my prelim got 16. I thought I was screwed like many of y’all, but don’t worry, most people do much better for o levels as compared to their prelims so just study hard. If you’re wondering, my o levels l1r5 score was 9 raw. To give you guys motivation, I’ll tell y’all my scores for prelims for each relative subject and compare it to my o levels score.

English- A2(prelim), A2(O levels)
Emaths- A2(prelim), A1(O levels)
Amaths- D7(prelim), B3(O levels)
Chinese- C6(prelim), A2(O levels)
Humanities(ss,geog)- C5(prelim), A1(O levels)
POA- A2(prelim), A2(O levels)
Science(chem and phy)- B3(prelim), A1(O levels)

O levels isn’t as tough as you think, so don’t overstress, in fact, I only started studying 2 weeks before o levels but I mugged of course. Burning out is the worst that could happen so pace yourself.

153,[A Levels] Free GP tuition for JC2 students who cannot afford it,"Hello everyone, I am a current GP tutor and would like to tutor JC2 students who need help with GP but who cannot afford to pay for tuition. 

For now, lessons will likely be on Zoom. Once Phase 3 is in operation, the lessons will be held in my home at Pasir Ris, unless you would prefer for lessons to continue online. 

Unfortunately, at this stage I will not be able to help you with language skills - my focus will instead be on teaching essay skills and on answering the Application Question. 

Depending on the response, a session will consist of around 2-4 students. 

So if you need extra help with GP, please drop me a message! Tuition will be completely free. Please do not respond if you can afford to pay for tuition. 

Thanks, and all the best for your A Levels everybody!

154,"[Rant] Stop belittling people who like to make ""aesthetic"" notes.","I dislike people who say making those aesthetic notes are a waste of time like ya ok maybe to you but at least it makes studying fun for people? Like to some people it makes studying something they look forward to. To tell me to stop doing pretty notes simply because YOU see no value in it only benefits you because you get to fuel your sense of heroism in advising a classmate and ""saving"" them from the horrors of wasting more time by doing ""unnecessary"" work while I have to endure another round of nagging for the thousandth time from someone I can barely consider a friend. It hurt the first few times but now its just getting old.

So to the people who are on the receiving end of advice from people who think they're sooo much better and smarter than everyone and that everyone should follow their study method; ignore them. The moment I stopped doing whatever the heck i wanted with my own notes was the moment I stopped finding studying bearable and started failing my classes. Do what works for you and what helps you cope with studying. 

To the people who won't shut up about how another person's studying method is so ridiculously wrong, maybe just keep your mouth shut unless someone actually asks for your advice yeah?

And don't villainise your classmate for not lending you their notes because your notes are all over the place and their's are all organised and easier to read.

155,[A Levels] For those feeling lost and down about your A Level results,"Tldr: Spent another year retaking my A Levels after NS. It's okay to feel lost with your results and take your time to find out what to do next. 


No, I'm not some kid who scored 90rp after my second try, far from that. By now you would have had some time to process your results from this past Friday. My heartfelt congratulations to those who did well, but there will undoubtfully be those who remain lost on what to do next. This one's for you.

I had my first attempt a few years back, and I ended up scoring donkeys and elephants which were less than desired. I know what it sounds like - that I must be some slacker or someone who doesn't study, but my JC friends would testify to seeing me mugging in the school library everyday till the school closes. So as you can imagine, I was devastated on the results release day. I was lost and aimless for a very long time. My results were not good enough for any local university and I did not qualify for a third year back in JC. I followed my friends to university open houses knowing all too well that getting into one was damn near impossible. 

Nevertheless, after several desparate attempts of uni applications, I came to an acceptance and carried on with my National Service, hoping that an epiphany (or miracle) would dawn on me in the next two years, but I would still end up in the same crossroads 6 months before my ORD date. 

My parents then brought up the suggestion of retaking my A levels. It seemed laughable at first. I didn't want to go through the same hell I did once, only to get back similar or worse results. I just came to the conclusion that I was not cut out for the rigour of A levels, but after considering all my possible options (Poly, Private Uni, Overseas, etc.), I realised that this wasn't what I really wanted, and I wouldn’t have been happy if I had chosen an alternative route. So I swallowed my pride and entertained the idea of retaking my A levels after NS despite my some of my most valued peers advising me not to do so and that it wasn't worth it. It's a funny feeling when the people you love are so adamantly against your decision.

I know what it looks like on the surface, I would be potentially wasting a year of my time, but it was a leap of faith, and it felt like a long way down. After my NS, I immediately began studying from day to night everyday, and after two years of not hitting the books, it was a struggle to get back to the into the saltmine, I felt like a J1 kid all over again. 

Thankfully I had a wholesome support system. Ex-teachers and friends who were willing to help and a family that held me up, but I remember keeping to myself for much of the year and maintaining a low profile, hoping people didn't ask ""What are you doing now"". So I didn't have to explain my situation to them. Self-doubt was my worst enemy (also Econs) and seeing my friends move on with their lives in uni didn't exactly make it any better.

This past Friday I recieved my results, and although I didn't attain anything fantastic like 90rp, I still wept tears of joy knowing I could qualify for the uni course of my choice, and the assurance that the past year of stuggle did indeed pay off. 

So for those feeling lost in the aftermath of your results, don't give up. Consider your options well and follow your own intuition. Don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do, and definately don't underestimate your own potential, after all learning to take a challenge is an invaluable life skill. So cheer up, chin up and know that there's still hope for you. Kudos for sitting through this long ass post.

157,[Uni] How I Got Myself Into NUS Without Fantastic Grades,"Ok I’m going to share how I managed to so-called ‘game my ass’ through the NUS admission process for the Industrial Design course last year. (This one [https://did.platform.courses/2020](https://did.platform.courses/2020))

It’s uni admission time again and I’ve had enough of people talking about their A’s results as if it is everything, and I’m sick of the way many courses accept applicants just by how much of a mugger they were. Well, if you think I used my grades to buy my way into NUS DID – you can stop reading already.

First things first, results. Not gonna lie but mine was trash. I scored 69.5 rank points for my A’s.

But I knew I still got a shot. I mean after all, what have I got to lose? I knew that if I manage to land myself an interview, I can kill it at the interview process, because that’s the kind of thing I’m good at - Not mugging, I’m talking about real life-skills folks.

All I needed was one shot at getting the admission interview and I can call it mine. First thing first, I slammed a glorious testimonial under my discretionary admission in my application. Please make yourself sound like a legend in your involvement and contributions in JC, or even secondary school. TBH just beg your JC teachers to write some gold for you, be shameless. Once, you land your ass a chance for the interview, boom, results don’t matter no more homie.

Don’t believe me? Well I initially had the inkling that as a talent-centric course, the aptitude interview might matter more than my results, but after I got in and had chats with the profs over the past year, I found out that it is even more extreme than that: **If you do get to the interview stage, your results won't matter no more mate. Yes - nada. You heard me. It’s all on the interview.**

This, for many, is like a second chance - if they have that creative spark and good ideas, but somehow screwed up in A’s because things were just too… well, it’s As, can’t expect everything to be smooth man. If you don’t believe me, just ask around the current NUS DID students and you’ll realise that several of us came in entirely on the merits of our interview.  I know, ID is quite an elite course with its high IGP, sometimes even higher than other design courses like Archi... but son you just need to know the rules, so you can break them and make them play your game. 

Anyway, back to trying to get an interview... Remember whatever testimonials you can get and ‘portfolio’ you can produce... know that you’re not bullshitting, it’s just about making things more..... dramatic. This is the most important first step if your results “cannot make it”.

Now, before you might think that “Oh shit! It’s a design course! I need a portfolio... Should have done more sketches or whatever”... blah blah blah. Chillax, you don’t really need that! It’s not even that “it’s good to have” but legit, **YOU DON’T NEED IT AT ALL!!!!**! You don’t even need to know how to draw (They train you here). All I did at the interview - wait for it - is show them some photos of stuff that I baked all the time during my free time HAHAHAHA. (Ok I admit - I’m pretty good at baking... there’s legit creativity and craft in my baked goods.)

Ok the point is, just tell them what you’re passionate about, anything related to design and you’re game. This is from the mouths of my own profs - what they’re looking for are your creative pursuits (whether it’s visual or anything you’ve made), entrepreneurial activities, and your endeavours in social contributions etc.

I won’t name who but a professor told me results are not always a good gauge and sometimes the wrong people do get into the course. Like they’ve held some interviews with candidates who aced their score in A-levels but really weren’t suitable for the course, and NUS still admits them nonetheless because their high score gets them somewhat of a ‘green pass’. I quote him, “Their results may be excellent but they don’t have the type of flexible thinking that can go back and forth between scientific rigour and artistic spark,” But unfortunately, NUS being NUS as always, offers these top scorers ‘almost unconditionally’ anyways, since it might just be one of the most ‘objective’ measurements and I guess results have some correlation to subsequent good performance too - so that can’t be helped. And to be fair, I have classmates who were A-Level top-guns who are also aceing our DID classes right now. So it’s not always the case that the straight-‘A’s guys don’t deserve to get into DID. I’m just mad because I’ve seen enough people who go to courses without real aptitude for it, and am also tired of people who think that just because they can do well in A-levels they will do well anywhere - that is just NOT true, and especially so in DID. You need to have the real goods man - whether or not you are a good mugger. This is precisely the reason I’m posting this. I want to help actual passionate and talented people into the course and not just some arrogant mugger who thinks that they can do anything as long as they have those ‘A’s on their result slip.

Ok, another thing - especially if you suck at interviews - here are some other hacks I’ve dug out from talking to the profs:

They are looking for a mature conversationalist who can dialogue sensibly back and forth with them about design and innovation topics. Not smoking them, but actual substance and content. Someone who presents enough curiosity and open-mindedness to everything! So be sure to not be square during your interview! Also, part of how they assessed us was a sense of whether we really knew what we wanted.

And one more super important tip - before the interview, they will send you a ‘prep kit’ to help you prepare for the interview. Read and watch **every single thing** in that kit, and formulate your own point of view beforehand about those materials/videos. Insider tip - half the time in the interview you’ll be chatting with the professors about the videos you watched in that prep kit - and your response to each one. 

In case you want to check out the contents of this prep kit or you want to get a head start, this year, you can download the prep kit here [https://did.platform.courses/2020/](https://did.platform.courses/2020/). It’s near the bottom of the main page.

It’s super obvious  to the profs if you did your  homework or not, and they use this to see if you’re  hardworking and diligent, to filter the fakes. They want to see if you have a genuine interest in this field, or you are just applying for DID as a ‘generally interesting’ backup choice instead of actual passion.

This evidence of ‘diligence’ is a very important criteria and they almost always reject applicants who seem like they were ‘smoking’ through their knowledge of the videos, or those who simply didn’t watch it. And boys, please, for the love of god, please don’t say you’re busy with army stuff. Let’s not kid ourselves and embarrass your ass. Anyway, if there’s a will, there’s a way. If you’re really passionate enough, you’ll find time to prepare. I know the profs don’t take your NS busyness as a reasonable excuse because they say you’ve been given ample time.

So, **just watch every damn thing in that prep kit**, and reflect on them. Like what you think was interesting and what was not... and what you learned, agree or disagree with the videos. They really measure your attitude by how much you have prepared, and if you seem like you didn’t finish it, you are most certainly out the door.

There are also SOME OTHER KEY THINGS THEY LOOK OUT FOR during your interview:

Besides general curiosity and what they call “open-minded maturity” in thinking - which are measured through a dialogue with the professors, they are also on the lookout for evidence of your making / creating hobbies and visual practices, to find out if your natural inclinations are to create and innovate. I’m not saying you should pretend and start making things for show. Come on man! They’ve been doing design for almost half of their lifetime. Do you think they really can’t spot things that you put together last minute just for the interview? I would recommend you to just mention your past involvements and hobbies and do bring examples! (like my cake and cookies). Even things like if you make/design class tee shirts, or are involved in set design for school productions, if you build model toys, make hobby jewelry, do pottery, etc. whatever! Bring these and show! Of course if you do stuff like cool inventions and maker-type things, or actually make contraptions to solve little problems in life, that’s even better. **Certainly an art background with work that pushes boundaries and showcases your rigour, thinking, and talent will be gold - but it is not necessary, most of us in DID do not have such backgrounds.**

So visual stuff  like painting, drawing, videography, animation, motion graphics etc. are also good things to show. But just as important are activities you show in risk-taking - like if you had your own business, or work that demonstrates your ability to be rigorous - like side projects that you’ve been obsessed with, or  just your ability to commit (like school teams and sports) and leadership - which is a critical skill set in NUS DID because many projects are done in teams. Just know that you probably have stuff to show if you recall properly and gather  the examples. Remember: DON’T FAKE IT! But definitely don’t neglect mentioning all these.

Another thing that seems to matter to  the profs is whether you show some interest in new things and the ability to play with/manipulate technology. So if you do any form of coding, web or apps, or even python - be sure to mention it and show examples. Same goes for those of you who are already tinkering with things like Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Micro Bit etc. But DON’T WORRY, such hardcore interest in electronic tech itself is not really necessary. We have friends who showed their  3D animations, CAD models, 3D prints, motion graphics, websites, or app interfaces. While some show lego models, Gundam models, and their interest in mechanisms and construction, and some even brought  their calligraphy stuff, pottery, polymer clay, origami etc. Whatever it is, it’s always good to show that you are able to dive into and play with some new things that are creative, innovative or technical - with a good level of finesse.

While such interests are not required and also may apply to only some particular course segments within DID - which you can select or avoid later on, nonetheless, having these in your interview profile will help.

Lastly, **have a point of view that shows your sensitivity and consideration towards human beings and humanity.** Design, especially at NUS, prioritizes the overall value of innovation for people and the world - over merely tech exploration and engineering optimization, purely artistic expression, or solely commercial gain. It is all things combined, assessed and balanced - for the overall good of humanity.

So in your aptitude assessment conversations - especially if the profs ask you how you would improve something about a product - don’t just add marketing gimmicks to it just to increase sales, or propose cliche additional features that many people will easily suggest because it is obvious - Seriously, if you are just adding a few more curves or making cliche suggestions like more colour options, decorative customisations, or more ergonomic grip… to make an object ‘better’, do you think it’s the first time they’re hearing this???

Make yourself stand out more - show that you are able to assess whether or not a product really needs to be more ‘effective’ than it currently is. So don’t simply solve technical issues only without regard for how it will change people’s experience with the product or service. Don’t just make more things. Instead, show your thoughtful judgement for what people and the world really need, consider how big or small the problem or issue is, and how much of scarce resources shall we use to provide a solution.

Have the mentality that you should add things to solutions that can help gain some form of improvement, but don’t forget that every additional feature will bring some inevitable disadvantage or downside. If you aren’t aware of this, or what that downside is in each case, then your knowledge on innovation and design will come across as shallow to the profs.

Ok, I’m more or less done with my rant.

WELL FINALLY, if there is only ONE thing you get out of this - remember that since the interview is so critical, and that results are worth nothing at the interview stage, JUST MAKE AN APPEAL even if your score doesn’t meet the high cutoff that the course tends to have. This is the same for JC students, iB students and Poly students. **And I don’t think I need to say this but you MUST put ID as first choice in your appeals or applications if you worry about your score - Duh!** Especially for appeals, it reveals what your key interest is and whether you know what you want. That is an important part of the assessment for your suitability. KNOW WHAT YOU WANT DAMN IT!

At the end of the day, I hope this post is helpful to those of you are interested in joining this course! This place is great and I need more of you good folks as teammates on projects here in NUS DID, not just the muggers ;) - Godspeed.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ff5uu8/uni_how_i_got_myself_into_nus_without_fantastic/,True,2020-03-08 18:20:19
158,[Uni] UPDATE on (NTU messed up my application),"Orginal post (NTU messed up my application): [https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gp77uc/uni\_ntu\_messed\_up\_my\_application/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gp77uc/uni_ntu_messed_up_my_application/)

UPDATE: 

On 26 May, at around 8 pm, I received a phone call from a faculty member of my second choice course (not the assistant professor). She called to inform me that from their database, I have indeed indicated the correct email address and it was a mistake on their end and apologised. She also called to confirm if I still wanted to be considered for my second choice course. I already accepted an offer from another university and asked to withdraw from consideration. However, they did not answer my enquiry in two things:

1. Why was the error made? (Was it a typo, assumption or something else?)
2. I had sent an email to the admissions office on the morning of 22 May (before finding out about the wrongly sent email) enquiring why I have yet to receive an application outcome. I got a reply saying that my “application is currently in the midst of processing” which is obviously not the case. Hence, I asked for an explanation on that. 

The faculty member said that she will respond with another email. On 27 May at 2:00 AM I received the said email and she explained that the assistant professor’s error “was a typo that she had failed to catch even when she referred back to the list to send subsequent email reminders”. So there’s the explanation that I finally got.

However, she did not speak on my second enquiry about the email sent on the morning of 22 May. I responded to thank her for her email and asked about the second enquiry again. I also attached the email sent on the morning of 22 May. Within a few minutes, I received a call from a lady from NTU’s admissions office. She called to apologise and say that the database indeed shows that I stated the correct email address. She also said that she was not sure why the faculty made the mistake, which was followed by a nervous chuckle. My question was still not answered. I got to the point and asked why was I told that my “application is currently in the midst of processing”. 

She explained that being offered an interview from a course is still considered as your application is still being processed. Therefore, the reply: “application is currently in the midst of processing”. However, this does not change the fact that this reply is vague with regard to my application status and failed to inform me that my second choice course had already invited me for an interview. If I were to have never found out about the wrongly sent email myself, I would have just been waiting and waiting for an update to the correct email address that would never come.

The lady on the call acknowledged this shortcoming and said that they will “feedback this to the school”. After the phone call, the lady followed up with an email clarifying that “the application status will usually be showed as processing because there is no outcome (successful or unsuccessful) of your application yet” and wished me all the best for my appeal.

A few days have passed from this incident and I have calmed down. I am grateful that I managed to get a place in another university and I was able to send my appeal to NTU before the deadline. I’m also very thankful for the two ladies from NTU that reached out to me. Both of them spoke to me with an apologetic and kind tone. They listened to what I had to say and were not defensive at all. I understand that in this situation nothing else can be done, I’m just satisfied that they acknowledged the shortcomings of this portion of the application process and will give feedback to the school. Time to move on\~

Also, thank you for all the kind words, empathy and advice in the comments, they really helped me during this time. All the best to everyone!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gre3zc/uni_update_on_ntu_messed_up_my_application/,True,2020-05-27 22:10:56

162,"[O-Levels] Congratulations, those who received their results today.","[Repost because I accidentally violated some rules in the subreddit. I'm really sorry, mods =w=]

The title says it all. Congratulations.

I didn't do greatly on my exams. I failed four subjects ahha. I have six recorded subjects. Or rather, had. I passed two of it. A C5 in English and a B4 in Design and Technology.

How do you say this..? I can't really blame anyone but myself. I'm disappointed, but also rather happy that I have at least courses to apply for in ITE.

=====================

A list of some of the things I did in 2020.

- After three years of slacking off, I decided to just study at the last moment. It worked in the common and semestral assessments, so it should work in O-levels, amirite?

No, it doesn't. My work ethic was nonexistent, and I had a serious addiction towards gaming.

- I got my EAE Application, nice. I don't need to study.

Yes, you do. Thinking back, EAE was more of Plan B than Plan A. Don't rely on it *too much*. I couldn't tell the difference between arrogance and confidence, but this serves as a wake-up call.

- Online lessons = holiday

No, no and no. Sleeping through important lessons are detrimental to your studies. As boring as it seems, listen. Down a mug of coffee if you have to, because it's difficult to mug with the presence of Covid-19. Sure, they took out last common topics, but it probably won't be the same this year.

Trust me, it's unpleasant to wear masks during the exams. Your ability to think on the fly will be halved because the other half of it will be concentrated on your breathing patterns. Uniform's already thick enough as it is. Wear mask even more sian. Singapore already so hot then mask amplify the effect.

=====================

So, what do I do now?

To start things off, I'm two years older than my batchmates, because I had to pause my studies in my home country.

Yeah, I had a great family and all, but outside of it I was ostracized pretty much everywhere for not knowing how to communicate, and for being too reserved. The environment I was in, if you aint talking, get the fuck out of here. It's the same in the academies I attended until Primary 5. We don't have the same ideas? You're excluded. You're lying to us? You're excluded. This and that, and more things to be annoyed at.

As a result, I'm always on the defense. Both mentally and emotionally. If I had emotions, I'll just suppress them, no problem. If someone was going to approach me, I'd be super suspicious and push them away as soon as possible.

What individuals would normally experience in their secondary school years, I had only experienced after leaving it (I don't know. I mean, what's the norm of secondary school's social life?). I let my guard down in front of some strangers, and they went in not to lunge at me, but to hug me instead. They're my best friends now.

I'm a failure now, but not in the future. Fuck the chances of taking O's again and the stigma that comes along with attending the Institute of Technical Education, I'm heading straight to ITE and I'm not looking back.

I scored 30 points for my O's (ITE ELB4-A, ELR1B3-B and ELR2B2-C all 30 points ah) and it isn't going to feel nice when your mother decides to tell the rest of the family. I disappointed her, and it's completely fine if she decides to tell them. She's a single mother, and the rest of the family is back 'home'. Still, the feeling of knowing that your family is aware of your results, it's suffocating to say the least.

It's nothing compared to what my mother is feeling right now, because she had placed her faith in me, only for me to destroy that. I have serious problems regarding my attitude. For the first time in my life I'm owning up to my mistakes, and it's literally in the lowest point in my life. I always had it easy, so I find it hard to take in all of this. Still, I think it's better for me to take this all in *now* instead of neutralising the effects of the hit, in order to condition myself.

To my juniors, or rather those who came after us. Don't be like your senior here. If you're looking for someone to laugh at, laugh at me if it makes you feel better. Don't end up like me. Failing is alright, but don't fail until you have no more room to fail. Online lessons are boring as fuck, and sorry if your teacher abit the guai lan, but the moment I failed o's looking back I should've just paid attention to my teachers. I legit just went back home to get told off by my mom, and probably by the rest of my family soon. I kena sai already so what more can I do right?

In this world, where your results define you and dictate where you go, save for the few outliers who broke everyone's expectations, your only option to be set free is through education.

That being said, congratulations if you made it to this point in the reddit post, and if you took the O-Level exams. Whether you passed or failed, I care not. And just to confirm, my intention is not for anyone to feel bad for me. As pathetic as I am right now, my end goal is to improve.

163,[rant] how do i become more interesting,"I can’t help but realise when people force their laugh when I tell them something I thought was funny which is so pathetic lol and also the fact that people tend to feel awkward around me. e.g. I used to sit beside rather extroverted people that make friends v easily, but i sat beside them a whole term and I barely talked to them. I was in a new class in sec 3 at that time and I didn’t know anyone, which made it worse. It’s really difficult for me to tear down that awkward barrier and all I could do to try and interact was to offer them food :p I had 4 friends that Ive clicked well with in sec 1/2 but we were all in diff classes by sec 3 and I was forced to find new people to talk to yet I couldn’t find anyone i could click to like I did with my close friends. So since i’m collecting results tomrw and moving on to another school, I want to ask for tips on how to be more interesting becuz nothing in my life is worth talking about since it’s just bland, and I just want to make some friends by the first week.

165,"[A Levels] Don't Worry & Don't Give Up, I promise you it's not too late.","At this current juncture, you have around one hundred days before the beginning of the most major exam in your life. When the numbers start to fall to two digits, the feeling of fear will rise and it'll become increasingly daunting.

Regardless of what point you're at in revision, be it you're already constantly doing practice papers or still struggling to overcome and understand certain topics—I'm here to serve as a reminder that you should never give up on yourself. 

Even if your results haven't been reflective of your efforts or you're not where you want to be in terms of your grasp in content and skills, you need to incessantly remind yourself that as long as the exam hasn't begun, you still have time. 

It's okay to be afraid because fear only shows that you care. But it's not okay if the fear stuns you instead of pushing you forward. If you haven't woken up from your daydream, it's time to buckle up because you need to put in the effort, give in your 110% and get the results you desperately desire.

You don't want to end up receiving your A Level slip with the inkling feeling that you knew you could've performed better if you tried harder. If you can't seem to find the motivation to study or feel demoralised by the results you've been receiving, you need to try and figure out what your purpose is. 

You're taking these exams for yourself. It doesn't matter what anyone says, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone. Do well for yourself, or find something that you want to achieve and use it to fuel your desire to succeed. 

Never doubt yourself because the simple irony in failure is that once you start to presume that you will fail, you're walking the path towards it. Don't let fear be your worst enemy and make sure to take time to rest because you don't want to end up burnt out. I wish everyone all the success that there is. 

We're all unique individuals with different strengths so make sure to make the most of what you're good at. :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hvm8zs/a_levels_dont_worry_dont_give_up_i_promise_you/,True,2020-07-22 19:26:25
166,"[meta] Things I wished I did as in secondary school, junior college and university","In secondary school

* Study smart and not hard: I belong to the group that struggle with O level but excel for A levels. How to study smart (easiest way) - prepare for topics ahead of class, listen in class, do your homework, revise and recap.
* On handling stress and emotions: If you are feeling overwhelmed, find someone suitable to talk to or do a rant here. The community is really good here. Important emotions to manage: self-doubt, imposter syndrome, anxiety. 

In Junior college

* Learn how to be confident of myself and succeed in scholarship interview. I did well for A level but that’s because I invested so much time in my studies. The funny part about 2 years of hardcore mugging? It is not about the struggle with exam stress and syllabus. It’s the struggle with choosing my major and being calm for my scholarship interview (prepared super hard but failed)

In university

* Learn how to manage my finances: It’s really cool to start working after O levels and earned some pocket money. This is the moment where I splurged and didn’t save much. As a student, we don’t really spend much time managing our expenses because we are so occupied with studies. So I only learn how to be more savvy with my money AFTER university. Read some personal finance blogs during your free time, learn some basic finance101 (where to put your savings, be wary when it comes to parting with $, do your research)

*also feel free to comment below if you have any questions, troubles or need advice*

167,[A levels] J1 Guide,"Yeap, so, I already made one for J2s and I'm back with another guide but this time for J1s and also this can be super duper useful for those still deciding on poly and JC life. Also for those sick of my guides, I'm sorry I legit have nothing to do at this point.😓 This guide is more for those who have already submitted the JAE form.

Also this guide is quite subpar because I was typing on a laptop but I hope this is useful to any newcomers out there.

* I did not get into a JC

It really is ok. I mean sure you can't really use this guide but I'm sure that there is MI, Poly and ITE as well as retaking O levels. No matter what, there are many alternate pathways you can have, it is just that there are many doors closed. But other doors are open too so try to enjoy it and if you still don't like it, there is always another option. Had a friend who couldn't enter JC, now he is doing well in NYP Nanotech anyways.

* I did not go to a JC THAT I WANT.

As much as I want to say there is poly and other pathways, I want you to enjoy the environment first. Yea sure may not be as good as the one you wanted but if it has your subject combi and the cca you want, then everything should be fine. Even if it doesn't, I am sure there are other ways to go about it. My point is, even if you do not reach the desired JC you want, study hard and make friends that you want. Think positively and plan your route. Because no matter what JC you come from, we have the same aim, to go to a university.

* I was forced/pressured to go to a JC

In a low tier school, this was quite common and there are people who want to drop and move to poly (especially after knowing CJC increased a lot at that time, many want to move out of my JC). Personally, I would say that firstly, yes, you can appeal but I have NO EXACT CLUE on how to appeal. But from what I have heard so far, appeals are not always successful, especially those who transfer to other JCs. And even if you got the successful appeal, you still have to study in the JC for 1 month before moving on to a poly and CANNOT withdraw back to your original posting. I have seen a girl in my CCA actually posted out to a poly so it is possible. But here is the website for anyone interested in appealing: https://beta.moe.gov.sg/post-secondary/admissions/jae/submit-appeal/ 

Secondly, I want to tell you that sometimes, things do not go the way you want. You can't get the course/job. You can't get through the CCA trials etc. I know it sounds so different to ""Reach for the stars and dreams"" but I recommend you start afresh and be prepared for what comes ahead of you. (Just like how guys have to prep for NS ehem ehem yucks). See things in a positive light, JC is not ALWAYS about studying, it is about time management, culture, friends and finding out identity. I have seen people go into a poly course they want, want to change their minds to another sector and regret their decisions. Meanwhile for JC, subject combinations are the most I can go to and the regret turns into a ""at least there are other opportunities"" as JC is very broad and diverse in terms of career opportunities.

So honestly, no matter which institution you go to, you still need to have a positive mind, study hard and make new friends. Aim to make your decision unregrettable.

I do want to mention that I was listening to ""The Thirsty Sisters"" by NOC podcast and one of the girls did mention on the point that even though you are pressured by others to go to a JC, overall, it is still your choice to listen to them. It is your choice to follow them and if not, your choice to accept JC and view it in a positive manner. And even if the decision cannot be changed, the other choices you make in the future can be altered by your actions.

* What should I do leading up to JC?

This is from my personal experiences:

1. Those taking H1/H2 Maths, I recommend revisiting your A Math syllabus as it can help with understanding certain topics revisited by the syllabus like Remainder Theorem and Calculus, especially for H2 Maths which is under assumed knowledge.
2. Research on the subject combination which suits you and the uni course that you aim to go. E.g. for degrees like NUS Real Estate, Architecture and NTU Sport Sci, knowledge on H1 Maths is required. For courses under STEM, H2 Math is required. For Engineering related courses, there is a high chance you need H1/H2 Physics. For Medicine, it requires H2 Bio/ Phy and H2 Chem.  In addition, find out other subjects too. E.g. Econs in H2 have a case studies and essays section while for H1 there is only case studies section only. H1 Science does not have practicals and H1 Art does not test on drawing but has an essay component on Study of Visual Arts(SOVA). I regretted taking H1 Econs instead of H1 Lit and got a C. Do find out about the CCAs and other programmes which you might be interested in as well. 
3. Prep stationeries and back to school stuff. For those aiming to buy a new laptop, do it now as laptops are somewhat required in PW for written reports as well as for certain CCAs like student council which requires event planning. This can be also helpful for those in H2 Computing as well. For those who need organisation, PLS BUY A PLANNER as well or any normal notebook to record down any hw or events important to you.  (Do I need to buy a graphing calculator now? Answer, not necessarily now, the school will have a day for you to buy graphing calculator and sometimes at aa cheaper price than normal. So really try to buy other stuff first.) (Also just saying sometimes,the files your sec school gives, may not be enough as the files given are much thinner so I recommend getting files which are thicker.) (Also, no textbooks are required but you will eventually need to buy notes from YOUR OWN SCHOOL
4. Hang out with your sec school friends one last time.
5. Research more about the school, find out what CCAs you would want to take and what programmes you would like to take part in. Oh and btw for those aiming to take 2 CCAs(like me) do be careful as it can get hectic, especially when events clash and hw starts to pile up. It is possible to have 2 CCAs and do well, just that you need time management.
6. LATE EDIT: Those studying H2 Chem, I recommend reading up organic chem(your CLT) and for those studyinf H2 Physics, recommend reading up electromganetic induction as they are tested in your H2 syllabus. For H2 Math, although CLT was vectors, the vectors in O levels is very different from A Level vectors so not necessary to read up but try to understand how to add/subtract vectors.

*  Orientation(first few days of school)

Scared? No worries, find a person whom you are familiar with and go to school together. Also, try to be participative and join in to the games, no matter how stupid they are. And for any waiting times in between, use this as an opportunity to talk to people. Don’t know what to say? No worries, ask them what school they are from, which ccas and subject combi they gonna choose  and what their hobbies are. Whenever you interact with people, try to not give short answers like. “Hockey”, “PCMe” etc, try to make it longer. “PCMe, because I plan to take engineering courses” or  “Well,I want to take a sports CCA, so I picked hockey”. Try not to force them to ask sensitive qns tho as it may make them feel uncomfortable to tell you about it.

Also it is quite normal if the first day is very...boring and unparticipative. It can take a few days for the ice to break. And once that happens, you would wish for your separation to not end. So do take photos and selfies for memories sake and enjoy your few days of  orientation.

Oh and btw, yes you are supposed to wear your sec school uniform and any shoes for orientation.

* Term 1- Term 2

For term 1-2, you may experience a few culture shocks here and there so here are my personal experiences.

* In JC, people buy notes in their own school bookshop. IDK whether some are individual or batch mode but from my JC(YIJC, people buy in batches to give out to the whole class) For my JC, we have people called “subject reps” and “class reps” who will collect money and buy notes. So do appoint one person in class to be the money collector to buy the notes.

* JC follows a lecture-tutorial system. Lectures happen in lecture theatres/auditorium and each class is designated a section in the auditorium. They do check for class attendance in the sense that it is not graded but you still must come because that is where all the lessons and new topics occur. Do read your lecture notes before the start of lecture and yes, you can do your tutorial before the first day of school. Trust me, it is worth it. Also, usually lectures are very...boring. People would end up sleeping or even worse skip lectures. (I won’t give ideas how) but just attend lectures and keep yourself awake. If it is very boring, just do your tutorials at the back of the notes, it can help. 

* Tutorials on the other hand are basically your normal classes where your tutor assigns homework based on the tutorial assignments given by lecture or your tutor. Do attempt your homework and highlight any doubt. If you are stuck with a qn, scribble down the working or at least write paragraphs of the essay if need be. Tutorials are also great way to ask for doubt when you are stuck with a concept so do use a sticky notepad and write down qns if need to. Also, do bring relevant lecture notes or a notebook so that you can write down any important details, misconceptions, tips and tricks that the lecturer did not cover.

* Normally I would say this is the period where the pace is slower as compared to J2 so do spend your time and hang out with your friends if need to after school to chill. However, do take note of CCAs and project work as well. CCAs are pretty chill at this point because this is when you just want to get together and understand each other. But do take note that there might be some who want to be CCA leaders and are just aiming for the position.. I recall someone from my CCA in J2, she was a J1 and she was crying when she found out she was not an EXCO member for a CCA. We could not find her afterwards. 

* Speaking of project work, you will receive your topic in April in which you will also find out your groupmates. And let me tell you, PW is the subject where it make or break friendships. A groupmate not doing the jobs their doing, another being very strict and picky over everything, a groupmate that you hate because of his insensitive comment etc. In my honest opinion, try to meet up once per month outside school to discuss how you want to do the project, either in skype or face to face. 

* Term 3-4:

I would say this is the period where friendships become stronger or break down as well as more drama would happen. 

* CCA becomes more intense with event planning as well as VIAs. CCA mates may also distance due to forming cliques as well as those who are EXCO, you might start to see the true form of your friends eventually.

* Have to deal with Project Work issues and conflict. And will have to be tested for H1PW and H1MT A level examinations as well as PW intensive. There are also people who start to give up at this point normally because you will start to see grades falling. I still recalled getting my first U during this period in Econs. Your focus turns towards promotional exams

*Mental health can worsen. I have seen people who became worse during this period. Loss in confidence, broken relationships, bullying, identity crisis, death of a loved one, etc. Even worse is when drama happens.  This also includes people who DID NOT GET PROMOTED as well.

Here is my tips during this period :

Honestly, buy a planner for any important dates, PW meetings and events as well as hw due. Take practicals seriously and try to complete your HW. 

For those doing MT, if you think you can get an A for MT aim for it. If your Chinese actually sucks, aim for an S grade at least because university admission requires at least S grade for admission to uni.

For PW, do try to meet more occasionally as time goes by. The thing about PW is that , just like poly, the tutor does not know how to deal with them. Personally, my opinion is that if you have someone who is struggling to keep up in PW or is not doing his part. Talk to them or report to the teacher.  Find out what is going on. You may not understand but you will realise why he is struggling, or if he is those people who are an asshole, tell him how much of an asshole he is. 

I say this personally, if you are suffering with mental health issues due to studying, talk to someone. It is best if you don’t suffer alone. I saw a friend who had relationship issues, he drank alcohol and posted it on Instagram. No one knew what happened and someone told me that there are people who found him “unfit to lead” due to his issues and so far from my knowledge, no one in the EXCO actually tried to help him. Eventually he led a bad life, did not come to CCA often, did very poorly for A levels, but he is starting over a brand new leaf and he will be going to a local uni. Talk to someone, if not talk to a school counselor, tutor or parent. 

It is normal to see Cs and Ds for J1. But do try to aim higher and attempt to find other methods of studying.


Lastly, here are my study tips for the J1s,

1. Find a suitable place to do HW, it may be the CC or the library. If it is at home, make sure to have an organised desk in a room. Sometimes locking the door works with the works(Wait until XXXpm). Try not to do your homework on the bed as well as you are more likely to sleep.
2. Earpiece? It depends actually but usually I would only play music and use my phone strictly for communications and listening to music when doing homework.
3. Should I make notes? In my opinion, you should start, especially since you are a J1. Sure I know, why bother making notes since they are a waste of time? From my opinion, making notes actually allows you to read the material as well as make your notes more organised and neater, especially when you are given words with a lot of notes plus the notes that consistently write down in class. But do note that you should not ONLY do notes as a study method. You need to pair it up with more practices
4. Laptop for studying? Er honestly, it can work but keep it strictly for studying and communications. Meaning, no netflix, no gaming, no fortnite whatsoever, no. And laptops are super useful for PW. However, you might need to use a laptop if you are taking H2 Computing.
5. Study with friends? Again depends but in my opinion, I would say studying alone is sufficient enough. 
6. Always organise your time well. Expect yourself to sleep at even 1 am due to PW. As for studying/ revision, I would say keep it  to at least an hour or more and use more of the time with PW and homework. Do try to use breaks and weekends as time to do homework or to hang out with your classmates during lunch. Also, yes, some people have burnt midnight oil before. It depends on you but honestly, try to keep it such that you sleep at 12noon.

Anyways, sorry for the long post but yay you may it through O levels. Be prepared because A levels is another ball game. So I wish those who are going JC have a pleasant time and I hope that covid will be over so that you will FINALLY experience the true JC life.

Oh and btw for a little bit of info, I had a raw of 13 and nett of 11, could have gone ASRJC but went to YIJC (yea even people asked me why I came here lol). I did 2 CCAs as well as TDP and I took PCMe. Gotten quite good memories and got a good grade of 76+rp. So if you have any qns, feel free to ask.

169,[A Levels] Stop comparing your results!!!,"Many of us have emerged from prelims (honestly not only applicable for JC students but also secondary school students), and while I think this is something universal for all students that is best kept in mind all the time, it's all the more to reiterate this at such a time.

**Stop comparing!**

The screwed up nature of our education system means that competitiveness is so easily breed and can become incredibly unhealthy in the blink of an eye. It's natural to want to compete and be better than others, but we must be careful not to let these wants and emotions consume us completely.

While you can and should use others' results to gauge your own performance, it shouldn't decide everything about your own worth and capabilities. Follow your own standards and goals; don't just blindly follow others.

Take for example (in the A level context) that you're interested to go for a university course with the 90% IGP (or 10% depending on university) of ABB/C. For that course an ABB/B would arguably be sufficient to secure a spot, and anything over than that would be a bonus. Of course everyone wants to do well and score 90 rank points (ie AAA/A) but it's important not to let comparisons with what others may and can achieve to your own standards and wants. That doesn't mean to settle for ""mediocrity"" - it only means not to be honest with yourself and not to push yourself over the edge.

Everyone has a different starting point and finishing point. But just because they're different, doesn't mean that they are in any way inferior or superior, despite what our society may want you to think. 

Just try your best. I know this may sound super cheesy and full of sh\*t, but honestly just trust in yourself and give your all. If your results are satisfactory, that's good. Even if not, you've already picked up important lessons and skills in preparing for the examinations, not to mention possibly learning more about yourself.

To those who are taking examinations soon, or already in the midst of one, all the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j2kb0c/a_levels_stop_comparing_your_results/,True,2020-10-01 03:23:29
170,[o levels] how i got by secondary school without tuition,"l1r5 raw: 11, l1r2b2 raw: 8. for the entirety of my secondary life, i have never attended a single tuition class. even in primary school, i’ve only ever had chinese at-home tutoring for a few weeks, then i stopped. whenever my friends find out i don’t have tuition they laugh at me, saying that i’m over-confident in myself. the truth is i’ve never had tuition since young so i was never used to it, even when i had tuition in primary school i felt like i never gained anything from it. 

the reason why i wanted to make this post is to share with you my personal tips on how i overcame o’s without the help of a tuition teacher. hopefully this will save some of you guys the cost of tuition, or even those who still go for tuition that it’ll improve your studying methods. 

first, and this is probably the most obvious: do every piece of homework. doesn’t matter if it’s some bullshit homework that you don’t think will help you in the future, but trust me it helps. especially everyday it’s best to train your brain and familiarise yourself to the content of whatever subject.

second, i learned this from one of the smart kids  in my class: go home and revise the topic you learn everyday. and i mean it: everyday. read your textbooks and notes like they’re a goddamn storybook. one of my classmates reads her geography textbook before she goes to sleep like it’s a bedtime story book. do notes every week for each topic you learned, don’t do them right before or during exam period. it sounds stupid and tedious but it’ll help in the long run.

third: this is more for o’s prep, finish doing the entire tys. doesn’t matter if you take 6,7,8,9 subjects. try to aim to finish all 10 years of each subject. i finished all 10 years for amath, emath, pure chem, pure phys. on top of that try to finish the test papers your teachers give as well. or you can even buy the past year papers from outside vendors. aim to finish all if not most. and afterwards, mark your test papers. learn from your mistakes. if you don’t understand why you made a mistake, ask your friends or teachers. this sounds like an impossible feat but i managed to finish all my ten year series within my 2 weeks of study break before o’s began. 

fourth: don’t be afraid to ask questions. consultations were always the greatest help for me and it’s especially helpful when you bring your friends along because they certainly have more questions to add on. we can learn from each other this way. you can ask classmates and friends for advice as well, plan study dates at starbucks and do test papers with them. i know some of you guys are introverts and/or like to study alone. but companionship will definitely help with uncertainties. 

finally: for the examinations leading up to o’s (mid-years, CAs, prelims, etc.) take them seriously. don’t slack off just because they’re not the big exams. these exams are going to help you prepare for the biggest one in your secondary school life. i learned so much from my past exams, about my time management, my strengths and weaknesses etc. i know of some people who like to pon exams or sleep during their exams just because it’s not o’s yet. don’t give up for these papers because you never know how much you can gain from them for your o’s.

to this year’s sec 4s, all the best! o’s sounds intimidating and nerve-wrecking but believe it or not i actually enjoyed studying and planning my time for o’s. don’t stress over it too much because burning out will hinder you from performing your best. always put your health before your studies. remember, even if you don’t manage to do well for your o’s at the end of all of this, it’s not over for you. there’s always an option to retake/retain, you’ll have the same opportunities as everyone else despite coming out later.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/eqq1gm/o_levels_how_i_got_by_secondary_school_without/,True,2020-01-19 17:49:26
171,"[A Levels] Free Notes (GP, Econs, Computing)","Hello! I'm currently in NS and I've stopped giving JC tuition because it clashed with my NS commitments, so I decided to upload some of my notes onto my website to hopefully help anyone who needs them :) Before anyone asks, they are available on the SGExams library as well, but since uploading them there I've made some minor changes and corrections.

They include GP question types and examples (topics include Media, Science and Tech, Politics, Environment, etc.), Econs essay points and evaluation, Computing definitions and qualitative answers. The Computing notes are for the old syllabus though, but I'm working towards updating them to fit the 2020 syllabus. Most of it is still valid, just that it is missing some of the new topics. There are some SAT notes as well if anyone is interested.

172,[Rant] When you’re wrong.,"[relationships] When you’re wrong

I am a firm believer of stoicism despite all the toxic masculinity the masses tend to associate it with.

I had a girlfriend - Our relationship was built on friendship and subsequently it became a romantic relationship.

She had issues to say the least - she was battling with depression and suicidal thoughts. I pushed on to be with her and continue to love her even on days when is difficult to love. 

As time progresses, she started to change, the person I’ve grown to love her for has started to fade away. 

As she’s battling with depression, I became the sponge that absorbed all of the flacks. In time, I find it difficult to remain positive. I - too, started to feel the effects. One day, I snapped at her after months. (I’ve always stopped myself because I didn’t want to add anything more on her plate).

We broke up. Can you believe that? All these times when I have sacrificed my own happiness - she let me go because of a single swing of catharsis. Her friends made the situation worse by reminding her what a “piece of shit” I was for doing that to her despite knowing what she was battling. 

I admittedly cry and feel like shit for days on end. For the next 5 months of so I tried to convince her to get back with me and told her that with NS coming I’d be able to focus on her. To no avail.

Her Polytechnic grades drop to a point that she can’t make the cut.

I continued to tell myself that I’d be better off without her

So what’s sad here? 

I thought that when I win a major competition- I’d get over her

I thought that when I got offers from NTU/SMU/SIT - I’d get over her

The point is, we’re humans right? Sometimes we don’t know what we need. It is crucial to let yourselves feel through the motions and let it define us for the better, always. 

I was wrong, 

I thought that if I had this - I’d get over her

I thought that if I had that - I’d get over her 

The only constant is time and with time
it will get more manageable with each passing day and eventually it won’t matter anymore.

I hope that all of us can stop thinking that we need to score to validate ourselves - thinking that a mere ego boost will be a bandage to our broken heart

I know she wasn’t the one, if she was, she wouldn’t have given up so easily. I can feel disappointed but I will not go on to live my life wishing that she was the one.

174,[RANT] WHY CJC IS DECLINING,"First of all, 


CJC is deeply divided by social status (iykyk)


Classes are pretty segregated. People are nice on the surface but it's kinda superficial. They look like the type who will backstab you anytime. I do not wanna say more but its something about students from affiliated schools. They think they have control over the school as they form a sizeable majority of the student population, and act their arrogance over students from neighbourhood school, thinking that they are dumb/inferior. Some students from affiliated school form cliques within themselves, refusing to mingle with neighbourhood school students, thinking they themselves are superior. There are many social climbers here and personally I am so sick of seeing them doing dumb things to gain attention, clout and fame.Classroom environment is not the best/ideal because many students often sleep in class/skip school/never prepare tutorials beforehand. I've personally seen home tutors giving up on their class before due to constant frustration. 


There are many vapers and smokers in the school. I personally do not see anyone smoke in school but I see people vape in different toilets at least once a day. In a class of 26, on average ~4 are part of the vice. If you are unlucky to be in a class with substantial bad influence, it is even worse because some of them will personally ask you to smoke or vape with them outside school. 


Teachers dont even bother to teach, or care about your grades, physical and mental well-being. They just leave you to rot when you cannot catch up with your studies as your grades deteriorate. There is also a ""blame"" culture exists from the teachers to the students. Sometimes when you ask a teacher for help, he/she will direct you to another teacher instead. Sometimes the teachers don't even bother to answer your questions and instead question you on why you did ask the questions in the first place. I do not know how to explain in a concise manner or elaborate further. I hope you get what I mean. 


An example would be many times I waited for teachers-in-charge outside the general office, so I waited a while and the teachers-in-charge almost always never come on time. Hence, I need to ask another teacher where he/she is. That teacher would  often lie and say the teachers-in-charge are not in school and I have to go home. Obviously I knew their tricks so I waited a while more before the teachers I wanna meet subsequently arrive. 


TLDR; 
The teachers are less than willing to help and sometimes feel annoyed whenever you ask for help. 


School management is pretty inefficient. The school tends to send important messages at the eleventh hour(e.g. Timetable schedule. Many times the school sent the schedule the night before. Hence, students do not know about the timetable schedule for the following week until the day before). Once, I sent a email to school enquiring about something important and they took 3 weeks to reply. How inefficient can that be???? Furthermore, the parent-student-teacher-peer support system is non-existent. The school does not check on your mental well-being if you are struggling with your studies. 


Many times the school sent us feedback forms on how to improve on the school, but nothing much has done since the forms is just for ""show"", which in a way the school still ""cares"" about you. Student welfare is 0. Students have no say about the school and the environment feels very rigid. Teachers and students more than often do not establish deeper relationships with each other. The only time the school provides us with ""welfare"" is when they give us towels and masks with CJC logo. 


School buildings are old and worn-down. CJC is founded in 1975 and has remained there since. The Exercise Corner has cordoned off as the wooden structure weakened due to rotting. Yet the school did nothing about this for many years. It does not help that the school is small (at 4 hectares big, which is 40000m^2, yes google map say so). We only have 3 running lanes for track. The hostel has been abandoned for 5 years so the school had plans but yet did nothing to convert the building for useful purposes. Some students took advantage of this fact and did illegal acts which I do not want to elaborate( not vaping or smoking, but still 🤢🤮, iykyk).I have seen it before. Bless my virgin eyes 👀. 


School notes are kinda useless and a lot of information/formula are missing. For content-based subjects such as Biology/Geography, the content of the notes is insufficient. Furthermore, many important details are missing, combined with multiple improper phrasing, occasional spelling errors and sometimes even wrong concepts are taught!!! For skills-based subjects such as math, I have to use other school notes to study because many of the formula are not even inside!!!! Studying with these subpar notes can sometimes be a pain in the brain.


 For Econs, many of them cannot teach and only reads off the slides without teaching students on tackling the questions with proper answering techniques, or identifying key phrases so that students will not repeat the same mistakes again. To put it in a better perspective, it's like giving math answer keys to students without teaching them step-by-step, why this step leads to another. Students just copy the answer keys blindly with no understanding in mind.


 I feel like the teachers there are not willing to teach the students. They are only there to receive paychecks when they are not doing their job well.


There is also no ""guidelines or learning objectives"" for every subject. Hence, some classes teach at a faster pace and some classes at a slower pace. Teaching styles vary from teacher to teacher but it's still bad because there is no system in place so that the teachers will know what is the bare minimum to teach so that students can achieve a good grade should they put in some effort. Lessons are not well-planned at all. There is no lesson structure, goals and objectives set aside to achieve by a certain time frame. This can also be applied to non-academic subjects such as PE.


The only decent subject departments are History, English Language and Linguistics and Literature in English. 


Overall, CJC focuses on individual and independent self-study. If you are the type who depend on teachers to attain good grades, please do not bother to come to this school. The notes are not helpful either. 


For sports CCA, we do not have many sporting achievements so you can say we are mediocre in sports. 


For performing arts, they are decent as many of them achieve distinction/gold for SYF occasionally.


Club-wise I cannot say much but they are not good and not bad either. You may consider them if you wanna join a ""slacked"" CCA since it is compulsory to join one in CJC. 


All in all, the school has many rooms of improvement which I do not think the school will fix them in a near future. I really wish the school will improve someday should they reshuffle their management committee.

175,[RANT] Would you consider this Racism??,"Okie So a bit of background info. I'm working in a payment service as a promoter(Tell them to download the app and pay using the app). Another piece of info is that I am Indian.(Important for later). I'm bassically paid $10/Hr to do this(9 hr a day,1 Hr break). 

The first week of my work It was a new and kind of fun experience. Even though I had 0 people on the first day😂. I slowly started learning and was able to get 11 people on the Sunday.(Worked from Wednesday to sunday). It took about 45 min to go to work but I wasn't complaining. The staff their was nice and even allowed me to rest with them when there was no customers.

The second week(The current week bassically) is when all he'll gets lose.) This week I am also working Wednesday to Sunday. The shift was auto assigned by the supervisor so I landed at A-mall(Not revealing real location). A-Mall was around 45 min away. But travelling really took a toll on me especially since its tiring to come back home. I requested to go to B-Mall which was 5 MIN away. Surpsing nobody, he said I will have to go check with the person assigned at B-mall. Its too much trouble so I decided to just stick with A-mall. THAN, he texted saying that if I want to go to C-mall as the person assigned to that said A-Mall is closer to their home. C-mall is 1hr 15min away.(Had a direct MRT though). I refused since I am not willing to spend 2.5hr a day travelling. So I was assigned to A-mall the entire week.

My first day in A-mall was not bad. I has a total of 9 people which was above the target of 8. Than I received a phone call from the supervisor saying that the staff complained to their manager about my bad BO. I was abit confused since I didnt rush to anywhere and I remember applying cologne before work. But I brushed it off all be it was quite annoyed that the staff couldn't tell me and told their manager.

My second day was also not that bad. I had a total of 11 people. However their was a staff which said If you help me with some stuff we can also help you. Sounds reasonable so I helped them unpack the inventory which was shoes and even helped customers get a shoe of a certain size. I had my break and I finished my food quite quickly. So I decided to go back to the store since I didnt wanna hog a seat. I sat down in the staff room and was playing a mobile game. The staff seemed cool with it so at the end of the break I was back to promoting . At 6pm there was literally 0 customers. The staff mentioned earlier in the post was having his second break. I was playing a gatcha game to pass around 5 min and I left to continue working. The worker who was watching netflix said "" you know even if their was no one in the store your suppose to be walking around"". WHICH WAS IRONIC. But I said sorry and went back to work. Work went on as per normal and no phonecalls or anything. But boy was I wrong. Again I thought to my self that today went well. 

Next day went to work as per usual. Than during the break I got a phone call from my supervisor. He called and ask that if I had sat down in the staff room for 5 min playing with my phone(yes in this much detail). I told him yes and that I was there cause my legs were tired and that there was literally no one in the store. He said the manager launched a complaint to my company saying that I was slacking off during work. I was so angry that I wanted to say that I was doing more work than I am being paid for. But I just said sorry and continued working. I made sure to not even sit or slack off. I stood for 6hr straight and got a total of 12 people that day. I was pist af but the commission was decent so I aint complaining. 

But today was the last straw. I woke up probably 9.30am and was getting ready for work. At 10.30 am  I received a text that I was being transferred to D-mall on that day itself. The supervisor called me and his reasoning was infuriating. The manager does not want an Indian person as customers would not feel compelled to shop at the store and some shoppers speak Chinese.(Which I cant speak). He also said that the manager isn't confident to have me due to the 5 min break incident which was 2 days ago. The wierd thing is that I HAVE NEVER MET THE MANAGER. Now I'm working at some shop which promotes a better deal the company I'm from is promoting and what they are promoting is much more established than what I'm promoting. 

The most infuriating part about the manager statement is saying that I am incompetent even though I had the highest amount of sales this week 

This brings me to the issue of racism. In my opinion I would consider this racist as even if I had a good understanding of Chinese I honestly doubt the outcome would be different. Let me be clear I am OK with casual racism. In school me and my friends would make jokes which I would get a kick out off. (When the lights off and we can't find you in the dark)etc. These jokes to is definitely racist but I don't take them to heart cause I know its all just a joke. 

HOWEVER, we know this common stereotype as Indian smells like curry or very lazy. I'm probably just finding fault at the manager with how angry I am but I do see a connection with the remarks from the store manager and a common sterotypes. However the final straw really is when they limit my earning potential because of race. 

The manager has her rights to not allow em to work their if I am not performing up to standard but to not allow me to work at that outlet cause of an inability to speak a language is too far. I remember this contreversy about a job application which states that workers must be able to speak hindi. Many people found it offensive. However let me flip this situation back. It took almost a month for me to find a job because most say that it requires chinese. No one found that offensive. Its because its become the Norm in my opinion.

The reason I wanted to find a job is to pay for my diploma, laptop and meals so I would be more independent. I have to endure this for prob a month to have enough money to buy a laptop at least. It would probably take till 2021 to even find a new job.

Whether your Indian, Chinese, Malay or any race for that matter. I would like your honest opinion and if its racisim or that I am overthinking it. Please be Frank and don't sugar-coat anything since this problem affects many people who work in Singapore. If this post offends you please let me know so I can make nessasary adjustments. I will edit this post when I have more info on whats happening next.

EDIT

okie some updates. The place I was transferred to was not bad. The staff were nice and I was even able to game on my phone during work. So far seems good right. Yeah I thought so.

I was transferred to a different branch of shop C which was near my home. I thought I was safe. I did what I was asked but than I jus got an sms saying I was told to be removed from this. My supervisor caught on that It was probably targeted since only this specific company manager complained(Same management I think). I am posted to the branch stated in first para of edit. The staff their is nice but still food abit ex and stuff. Can't complain since co workers are super nice to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kblclb/rant_would_you_consider_this_racism/,True,2020-12-12 23:57:47

177,[Rant] How anxiety led me to my U Grade,"hello everyone. i know it might be weird to share personal stuff here but I just wanted to share my story. I feel that we should introduce the narratives that different students have and I will share with you the perspective of a student paralyzed by their anxiety.

Firstly, I'm in a JC and I'm here just because I met the cut-off points. I have no family members who have went down the JC route so I came in completely blind. When I first came in, I was relatively motivated, I did my tutorials and paid attention in lessons. However, the moment CB struck, I was completely thrown off. I couldn't pay attention to lessons as I had no laptop/computer so I had to juggle between google/zoom/drive on my 6 year old android phone that overheated after 3 lessons. I would get distracted by the loud construction noises and lose focus on important notes and deadlines. Furthermore, my notes made no sense ! Due to constantly flipping between apps, I would always struggle to keep up with what goes on and I just write whatever I hear. After attempting to be on par with my classmates for weeks, I just got sad and stopped. I tried so hard to do well online but it was demanding. I started to come to online lessons late, skip lessons to take naps and just eat while my tutors talk. I just gave up, it was too exhausting. That shitty attitude was brought forward when CB ended. I came to school and just existed, living life carefree and moving with the flow.

***Here's when it goes extremely downhill.***

Late July, I started getting addicted to caffeine. Every time I drank coffee, ate chocolate, my heart would race like mad, I could feel it against my chest and I would lose focus so badly. It was such a insane experience but I couldn't stop. One day, after drinking two cups of coffee, I temporarily passed out in the toilet. No one was with me then, and luckily it was during break. Disappeared for 30minutes and came back to my friends and said I had a stomachache. It fueled my anxiety. As previously mentioned, my attitude became shit, and I just didn't do my tutorials anymore. Till today I have 30 pending assignments on google classroom and I am not proud of them.

When I came back home, I shut myself away in my room and just cried and smacked my head against the wall. I didn't do it too violently but it was repetitive. I don't know what happened but I just couldn't do work anymore. In August, we had a Maths test, and our tutor was so insanely kind and told me I should try and I did. I went back home, took out my GC and notes and then vomited. I couldn't even look at my schoolwork anymore. Every time I came across Maths especially I would get nauseous. I started to cry in my sleep and would wake up with crusty eyes.

Everyday, I came to school and just existed, put a smile on my face, make everyone laugh, but deep down I truly just wanted help. I have two leadership roles (one of them being a scholarship) and I feel so disgusted every time because I am supposed to be their role model, but look at me. Disgusting. I couldn't ask help from my tutors because I felt guilty and ashamed for not doing their tutorials. My class is full of smart muggers with rbf so I restrained myself from asking for help, cause why would they help and pity a poor peasant like myself.

Everything finally came together near promos, I vomited, cried and had anxiety attacks everyday, I felt like a zombie, coming to school with foundation and eyedrops to cover the dread beneath my eyes. But, I knew that no one is here to help and I could only rely on myself so I brought plastic bags into my room and just dry vomited whatever and forced myself to retry my assignments and do some questions, read some notes and just do it. I only had a week left but I just tried. **Here are my promo results.**

**H2 - U/ E/ D H1 - U GP - D**

I got 2 inevitable U grades. I'm probably capable of promoting but honestly, I don't want to.

I know this has been long but I just wanted to say that I think I did ok for my promos, seeing what I've been going through, I think this is ok. I just wanted to share it here because I know no one around me would understand why I'm actually glad with what I got.

I hate being anxious, I hate that feeling and I hate that I allowed it to paralyze me so badly. I want to retry, I want to give this route another go and I want to retain to do it.

So my dear friends, please be sympathetic to the people around you. Legitamately, you have no idea what someone might be going through. Anxiety can really pull you down. I know you shouldn't blame your failures on mental health but for me it definitely was a fundamental reason for the way I acted. I'm trying to change and build better coping mechanisms so here's to that lol. Hope you have a good week ahead and thank you for reading this far, absolute poggers.

*^(p.s. since im here, can anyone recommend cheap h1 maths/h2 history tuition/advice. i have to pay using the money i saved up lol so im tryna get it as at low a price as possible ahhhh)*

**edit :** a lot of different perspectives coming in and im currently gathering info and hearing all of your experiences and legit thank u for that,, i didnt really expect to get so much responses but everyone's words of encouragement really made me feel assured and willing to try harder ! i also realized that when I typed this, it was relatively myopic and i guess thats the consequence of not talking to anyone about it. so thank u for your views, it really helped me to see beyond my tunnel vision. i hope yall have a good day !!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jrl2lr/rant_how_anxiety_led_me_to_my_u_grade/,True,2020-11-11 05:38:47
178,[O LEVELS] Tomorrow's D-Day for SS!,"*UPDATE: Due to a surge in demand, I will try to answer any last-minute questions from 6am to 7.30am!*

No extra tips here this time round. But I will be willing to answer your last minute questions here or through DMs.

Promise me to sleep early and not think about how you will eventually do. Just take the paper with an open mind and give it your all!

You can do this. I'll be rooting for each and everyone of you, at every corner of Singapore.

At the end of the paper, give urself a pat on the back. Tell yourself: I finally mustered all my courage to overcome one of my most hated subj by completing the paper - which is what i saw in most of ur dms haha.

Ask away any question. No question is stupid :) Will answer to the best of my abilities to make sure you FULLY understand. Ultimately, the other 50% comes from you.

All the best!

PS: Please write legibly. Your SS papers are marked by local teachers. If they can't read what you're writing, that's it. They won't spend the time to figure out or assume what you're writing. I know it's difficult given time constraints, but make sure you can at least read your own handwriting ok 😂

And as much as you are not marked for spelling or grammatical errors, please make sure your ideas can be understood. Do not write in complex sentences or in a too complicated language/manner which confuses the marker. Keep your ideas concise and succinct, as far as well-developed analysis is necessary. 

Attempt each PART question on a fresh new page. Avoid excessive cancellations and inserts which may make the organisation of ur answers messy. So plan how you are going to structure your analysis before answering the question. Do NOT strike out your paragraph if u THINK your analysis is invalid or weak, because sometimes this para may in reality be better / more valid as compared to ur subsequent para. Just create a new paragraph and continue. 

I repeat: Remember to ATQ for EVERY question.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jhmete/o_levels_tomorrows_dday_for_ss/,True,2020-10-25 19:13:52

180,[Uni] How to start dating in uni? (and an amalgamation of love life and uni life questions),"Using a throwaway account so I don't doxx myself on the internet lolz

I'm just an 18 year old girl with no dating experience who has just finished their A Levels recently. Although I wanted to get a boyfriend in JC, I was held back by some unforeseen circumstances and have been single for my entire life ever since, and now I really want to get a boyfriend in uni by hook or by crook. I know i risk sounding desperate but it's really been one of my goals for a long time now ;-;

In general:

1) How's university dating culture like? I'm curious especially about NUS FASS since I'm aiming to get there
2) Is it true that as a girl in uni you're likely to have guys (most likely gor gors who are a few years older than you) in your year/course that will take interest in you? At least that's what i heard from several guy friends who have completed uni.... 
3) Would I have a higher chance of finding a boyfriend if I go to hall? What's the culture like in hall? I'm thinking of staying in hall too so I'd appreciate any advice!
4) How do I approach guys and start dating them? I'm particularly insecure about this since I just seem to have bad luck with men and hope I don't end up friendzoning them or being too intense and scaring them away??? I've always been buddy-buddy with guys but I'm really unsure about how to actually get them to be interested in me. As I said I have little to no relationship experience and I think its fair to say I want to find a boyfriend in uni
5) Are appearances or personality more important to men? Just curious about this one since I've heard many of my guy friends say they think appearances are important, but personality has to play a part too right? What's the balance between the two?

Anyways if you reached the end of my rant I would like to apologise if I seem whiny/angsty/desperate about getting a boyfriend. It's a wish that I really want to achieve someday sometime, without the disappointment I faced when I kept getting rejected by all my crushes :( I'm also not sure if this is a good place to be asking for love advice, but I guess it is somewhat relevant since I'm targeting dating in uni. I'd be fine with general advice as well though!

181,[Rant] I don't like who I've become,"The exam stress has been doing weird things to me, I have all these thoughts raging to get out of my head so long rant ahead. I realised that I've become really insecure and over-anxious. I know that I shouldn't worry about how I did in the papers since it would just affect my mood for the remaining papers, so my brain just conveniently decided to pick another topic to stress about smh

At my school's urging, I applied for quite a few internships, which said they'll contact shortlisted applicants from Nov onwards. I haven't heard from any of them and my stupid brain is going all ""Omg why is there no news? Did you fill in the wrong email? Did you screw up the application write-up? Your prelim grades weren't good enough, so you're being passed up"" & so on. Initially I wasn't even intending to apply for an internship, but my school kept reinforcing that we should make productive use of our time and attend internships, or attend online courses to boost our portfolio & give us an advantage in uni applications. That made me feel bad about wanting to slack off after As, since it sounds like everyone's going to accomplish so much and you'll be losing out etc. Heck, I'm so tired and burnt out from studying and worrying about grades. I was looking forward to doing absolutely nothing and just relaxing after As but now I can't even enjoy that because once I flop on my bed, a voice will whisper in my ear, ""you're losing out""

I never thought I was a competitive person, but now I feel the intense pressure to achieve, to be busy and to not lose out to others. I know that comparison is the thief of joy, but I still fall into the trap of pitting myself against others and being too aware of what other ppl are doing, how they are surging past and surpassing me. I hate how I need to depend on external validation and being 'useful' to feel good about myself. I hate how that voice keeps taunting me, ""you can't slow down, you're not good enough, you have to keep up or you'll really never be good enough"". I don't know if anyone else feels this way, but even though As are ending soon, I don't think I can ever escape that endless cycle of anxiety and insecurity.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jxmmkr/rant_i_dont_like_who_ive_become/,True,2020-11-21 02:20:17

183,[RANT] Nasal Swab Test and impact on Fam/School,"For some context, I am in JC Y5. I have a younger sister in Sec 3 and Mum who works as a teacher. My dad currently works from home.

I've been spending the last 4 nights without sleep because I've had to make preparations for my CCA and I've had a few tests this week. I woke up yesterday morning feeling... not great, but y'know what, I had a Math Test that day and like hell I was gonna go let my all-nighters go to waste, so I went to school anyway. Cut to me, on the bus, practically dying because the headache I've been having for the past few days suddenly felt like my brain was legit about to explode and It's painful to swallow because my throat is sore. I get to school early, like at 6.30 am usually, and decide to take my temperature because that feels like the right thing to do. It shows up 37.4 degrees. OK.

I decide not to take a chance and go to a polyclinic before attendance is taken so I don't have to go through the hassle of filling up a form, and draft an email to my Subject tutors otw to the clinic. Since I'm above 16 years old, I don't inform my parents because I know they'll probably be busy in a meeting or something, so I make an appointment by myself. At the polyclinic, the nurse gives me a 'yellow' warning and I go into this separate waiting room. My temperature is taken and lo and behold, it registers at 36.7. Not Feverish anymore. OK.

I enter the room, and the doctor seems like he's in a rush, so I tell him why I feel awful and he asks me to call a parent so that I can do the Nasal Swab Test. I call my mum, she gives her permission, I go on to take the test. I ask the doctor whether this will affect my parents or not, he says no. Got issued a three day MC. I collect my medicine and go home and sleep until the next day.

Cut to today, my sis is sobbing at school because she told her teacher that her brother is on MC and went for the swab test and her school asked her to go home, so she misses her Bio test. Her teacher calls my dad, I call her a Grab to come home. My dad, still at home, gets angry and says that I should have just come straight home and not gone to the doctor because now my mum will have to pay for the swab test, which costs $250, and my sis and my mum will not be able to go to school until I get a negative result in 5 days. He talks about how there is a chance that my test result gets confused for a positive, everyone in my family has to stay home for 14 days, and the entire family gets screwed over because I didn't check with my parents first, and that I should not have gone to the poly unless i felt like I was honest to god really dying.

At this point I'm too tired to disagree even after taking my medicine, but I am pretty sure that some of what he said is incorrect, like us having to pay for the test, but now I feel shitty both physically and emotionally, especially since my temp is now 36.9, which is NORMAL.

tl;dr - Went to school, didn't feel great, went to a polyclinic, got yelled at by dad. Now I am panicking - was it selfish of me to go to the polyclinic? Half the time I still can't get out of bed but I rlly feel bad for taking MC now. I feel like I should have just powered through the school day and I made a bad situation worse. Now, my sis, my mum and myself are missing lessons which is worse now that HBL is over.

184,[Rant] As we end our exams...,"Not exactly a rant but it's the closest flair to what I want to say.

As Os, Ns, and As come to an end (and also finals iirc), I think it's important to remember to keep to COVID-19 safe distancing guidelines. News came out just a few hours ago that the first reported community transmission case in over 2 weeks came from a man who ate at Tampines Mall with 12 other relatives.

[Man, 32, tests positive for Covid-19 after family dinner at Tampines Mall's Seoul Garden with 12 people](https://mothership.sg/2020/11/covid-19-november-26-full/)

Investigations are still underway so we can't say for sure whether he did violate COVID-19 safe distancing guidelines. Either way this is certainly not what we want, with Phase 3 so highly anticipated at this point.

And this somehow reminded me of the instances where I saw acquaintances and friends go out in large groups of more than 5, even posting them on their social media platforms (clearly not very intelligent there). 

So yeah, to quote PCK: ""Use your brain, use your brain, use your brain!""

185,[rant] unmotivated,"usually i have a lot of things to say. but not this time. with every passing day i just feel less and less motivated. i am tired of studying. even when i tried to study i still do not feel good about the papers. sometimes i dont even know why i try.

i know a levels is coming to an end, i should suck it up and get through the remaining days. but i can't anymore. i might be burnt out, like how i had been throughout the year, like a broken engine that starts for a bit, crashes, and takes a long time to reboot.

maybe i am not even trying like what everyone thinks of me. i can already foresee people downvoting me because i just reflect laziness throughout. i dont even know why i am writing this and wasting the time of whoever is reading this. but if you reached this point, good luck to you, don't end up in a shithole like me :)

186,[invite] recruitment of volunteers," Hello!!

Are you an o level / a level grad who's bored and have nothing to do since you're waiting for school to start? This is your chance to do something meaningful!

We are open to all students aged 16-24, studying / graduated at least secondary school.

We are planning a student initiated project where we provide academic support for underprivileged children around the Tiong Bahru area in Singapore who may not be able to afford tuition. We plan to reach out to those who may not be able to get tuition even though they need it, especially due to the Covid-19 pandemic. If you are interested in helping out, do fill in the form!!

""This is where education and inequality are mutually reinforcing. Higher-income families invest more in private tuition for academic subjects, extracurricular enrichment activities, and parental attention.

This enhances their children’s school performance and chances of getting into “good” (elite, brand-name) schools and universities, thus achieving credentials that employers value and reward with “good jobs” and high salaries. ""

CNA , Commentary: Can education fix inequality in Singapore? If not, what can?

We are recruiting people for 2 teams at the moment!

Planning team : to publicize this initiative , come up with lesson plans , liaise with parents / students, recruitment for more volunteers, more of the behind the scenes work! As we are in the initial stages of the planning do be reminded that it would be a little more work :D but definitely not too much!

Teaching team : crash course for psle / o / n level students in the last week of December, homework support in the last week of December, fortnightly tuition for students aged 7-16 (tbc) , come up with lesson plans. Do note, volunteers to the teaching team are still subject to further checks and may not get to teach their preferred subjects!!

Do be reminded that this is a student initiated project ( outside of school ) fully managed by volunteers. We are just a group of youths trying to make Singapore a better place! Thank you!

Project lite because we want to act as a light for underprivilidged students who may not be able to afford tuition or need help but does not know how to get it! We are a light to students and children who are buried in the dark so join us if you want to make a change! And be a light to somebody :D

sign up for this to join us to embark on this wonderful journey of helping the needy, meeting new people and developing your own leadership!

189,"[A Levels] Literally ""burnt out""","((Mandatory throwaway account notice cause it's way to obvious when people read about this HAHA))

So last last Sunday 8/11 I had a headache at night and I was like damn lemme go to bed early tonight and the next morning I woke up with a high fever. A high fever literally in the middle of A'Levels and the thing is that I haven't been sick for the ENTIRE YEAR and my immune system deadass decided to stop working in the middle of A's,, chile I'm speechless... Anyways I went to the GP on Monday and since I had fever + flu I had to get tested for COVID-19/ do the swab test and I had to get my results by Tuesday in order to take my papers on wed and thurs. Luckily for me the test results came out negative on Tuesday afternoon ~18 hrs after the test and fun fact the person that did my swab test was my jc's alumni lmao what a small world.

My fever obviously didn't subside after my swab test and it got worse throughout the week, I was averaging around 39.5°C and it got so bad I couldn't even open my eyes and when I was able to my vision turned yellow for a while like as if there was a filter on my eyes or smth idk I don't take bio lol and not to mention being literally stuck to the bed the entire day. I literally felt like I was one of the firebenders from avatar like it was the feeling of being burnt alive that really made my ass feel like I was going to freaking die or some shit lol, ISTG half of my brain cells were obliterated from how bad my fever was like my brain lowkey has deep fried brain cells somewhere inside idk. I went to the GP for 3 consecutive days and took all kinds of medicine to suppress the fever. The worse thing was that with the fever came tonsilitis which if you don't know are inflamed tonsils at the back of your throat so everytime I swallow anything (saliva, water, food) it will feel like a knife stabbing my throat and it was so bad I could barely drink water which was like essential for me to get well...  But you know you gotta do what you gotta do and I nearly dieded drinking water along but alls well and I'm alive HAHA.

Moving on because of my how bad my fever was, all I did was sleep (like a good 20hrs/day) and did literally 0 revision throughout the week. Mind you the papers I had were chem p3 and econs P1 and my chem has been horrendous the entire 2 years of my JC life and I went into the exam room with a blank piece of mind like honey my brain was as blank as the question paper 💀💀💀 the papers were alright but the entire time I felt like I was high because of the medicine I took to suppress the fever just to take the papers, and immediately after that once I reached home the fever acted up again and I was back to sleeping in. In the end my mom brought me to TCM and I recovered way faster than taking western medication??? (Istg TCM is some magical shit NGL)

To answer qns regarding my case of sick-and-doing-A's-in-the-middle-of-COVID-kind-of-situation yes I was quarantined in the other room even though my body temperature was below 37.6 as I would take medication in the morning just for my body to recover long enough for me to take the exam and the medication would then be useless after 4 hours lol. I still took the paper during the same time as the rest of the batch the furthest arrangement was just a special consideration sent to SEAB for my case and it isn't really much tbh I mean I wasn't allowed to sit of the paper at a later date so it's kind of a disadvantage for me and advantage for the rest of the cohort but oh well idrc since it's over :P 

yes I fine now and please guys although A's is coming to an end your life isn't so TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND DON'T END UP LIKE ME OK BYE

(Also I have no idea the cause of the fever but the TCM doctor said it was a virus but I recovered and it ain't corona so I guess we good)

but i just wanna ask... is it just me or is this year's o level EXTREMELY difficult? i just came out of Amath and that was a fucking killer, can't even lie. but like,,,, every paper has been sooooooo unnecessarily difficult, and much more than the previous ten years? never mind the fact that 2020 gifted us with covid 🤡. emath paper 1 was the easiest shit ever, and then that had to be ruined with pp2, which was pretty hard? i thought that it was manaeable, but i see why a lot of ppl had difficulties. anyway, i don't want to be ramble, but it cant just be me that thinks everything is super difficult, right?

191,[Rant] I just want to say something...,"If you are currently finishing up/ already finished your a/o levels, I just wanna say something. 

Congrats! Congrats for fighting so hard, having the grit to push through the toughest of days, to continue studying even when your brain has left the chat. Good on you for fighting through the misery just for a shot at a university. Regardless of whether you felt that you have done well or not, its time to take a deep breath and pat yourself on the back for all the effort. Even though I myself felt that i have significantly underperformed, I want to write this post to remind myself and all of you out there that whats done is done, one can only look forward at the future with renewed hope.

Even if you haven't completed all your papers, I want you to now take half an hour to do something you love, something to completely relax you and rejuvenate your spirit, something to restart your brain so that you can continue fighting.

 TO those who have completed their national exams, like you, my friends and I have fought hard for this exams, months and months of toil culminating in these few weeks of A levels. 

Tbh, I was feeling kind of empty after my main papers have ended, so I just want to take this opportunity to spread positive vibes to anyone who is feeling down or feeling like they have underachieved. Jia yous for the next stage of life and don't ruminate too much on things that are done.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jx2cz7/rant_i_just_want_to_say_something/,True,2020-11-20 05:07:48
192,[o level] encouragement!!,"(okay I get that my title is lame :<)

hello everyone! this is my first time posting and im kinda scared LOL anyways there’s something ive been wanting to address so bear w me and try giving this a read hahaha ~

Over the past two weeks, I have spent many hours on reddit reading responses towards examinations as well as how people are feeling. Most of the responses are negative and self doubting. Many have taken upon themselves to check their answers (same) and I've seen the toll of its impact on some of you. I have friends crying upon checking of answers and I also have friends boasting about how well they did. 

Regardless, I feel like no matter how badly or how well you did, you should always take it with a neutral and calm heart. Giving yourself false hope is pointless. Demoralising yourself is pointless. The exam has been done, what else can you do about it? Steal the papers? HA funny. There is simply nothing you can do but move forward. Maybe you really did so badly there is no hope for you. So???? What's the worst that could happen? ITE isn't so bad. Retaking isn't so bad. As long as you have the strength to continue, YOU WON THE BATTLE.

to those out there suffering. those considering self harm as a way to destress, why are you casting your mental health aside? you feel isolated? worthless? talk to someone. talk to your parents, talk to your friends, talk to strangers (be cautious) , anything is better than hurting yourself. better days are looking upon you and trust me, this isn't worth it. This. Isn't. Worth. It.

Yes, results are so detrimental to our society and I hate it too. But why are you devaluating your self worth based on numbers and words displayed on a piece of paper? RESULTS DO NOT DEFINE YOU. your results do not stop you from achieving your dreams. Your results either speeds up or slows down the journey. This is YOUR life, people can say what they want but this is your life. You call the shots and you experience these moments on another personal level. What your family say, your (toxic) friends say, does not matter. Everything is going to be okay. In case no one has told you, everything will be okay. The worst that could ever happen is you giving up. You can give up on toxic friendships, you can give up on impressing society, you can give up on diets. But, as long as you DON'T LOSE HEART, and don't give up on yourself, everything will be just right. :)

Pick yourself up. Start again. 
If you fail? 
Pick yourself up. Start again.

Your life is the constant variable, please stop letting your mental health deteriorate to the point of no return. You are so so so valued, it may not seem so right now but the sun will shine upon you again and everything WILL BE OKAY. 

I understand your panic, your worry but really, there is nothing you can do right now except to move forward. Accept what has been done and move on. Maybe you'll cry over it, throw a tantrum, eat a few pints of icecream, whatever. do whatever you need to make you happy. Life is way too short to just waste it on things you can't change. To those who have done well over the past few weeks , congratulations. Don't forget to thank the people around you who have helped you since the start, be it directly or indirectly. To those who haven't, itsokay, start again. I feel you. But really, as long as we don't give up on ourselves, the future is so bright and we will get there. 

LOL ANYWAYS, JIAYOUS EVERYONE!! THE BUSIEST TWO WEEKS ARE OVERRRR 🥳🥳🥳 take a rest and all the best to everybody who still hv remaining papers (elective / economics / science paper 1s)

193,[Rant] How many tuitions do JC students have?,"My friend laughed at me for having tuition for h2 Econs, when I told her that I attended a pretty expensive tuition, at $100 per lesson. I have tuition (closer to exams) for h1 math too, although not weekly. She told me that it was kind of laughable that a JC student is attending tuition when they are already in JC, which means they can study on their own. I feel hurt by this comment, it’s not like I can’t study on my own, I just cannot understand/ do tricky questions for math that is outside of my sch tutorials, and for econs, I really need model essays which my school department does not give (they only gave answer key to block tests, sample paper etc).
I can’t help but to feel ashamed that I have tuition (it made me jump from 36rp for ct1 to 62 rp for promos). I just want to ask whether the amount of tuitions is the average? Like is it ok to continue having 2 tuitions when i am broke but it helps?
Edit: I’m not extremely broke, my family can still afford it, they always tell me I don’t have to worry about money haha to just concentrate on my studies.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kcps51/rant_how_many_tuitions_do_jc_students_have/,True,2020-12-14 19:40:23
194,[A Levels] The Importance of Quality over Quantity,"Hello to all the JC/O-Level juniors out there who are struggling with studies (I was once in your shoes as well), have you ever encountered the painfully familiar scenario where you spent hours and hours studying for an exam, but the results turn out to be a huge disappointment? Well then it's time to ask yourself the very important question, how effective is your studying method?

I was once struggling with the same issues. I had exhausted every option in terms of studying environments. No matter whether I studied in a library, a cafe, a public bench or at home, I was somehow unable to focus. Even during the rare occasions where I was able to focus, I spent hours and hours just reading lecture notes and writing my own notes. However I did not realise that I was doing a very passive form of learning, and ultimately I was unable to remember much of the information at all. Sitting for the exams with little to no information in my head, I expectedly got a string of Es, Ss and Us while my friends scored As to Cs. I was one of the bottom few percentile in the cohort and only managed to promote by barely meeting the promotion criteria. 

In J2, I had a strong resolution to do better than the previous year. So I reflected and evaluated on my studying techniques and was shocked at how inefficient I was. I would copy out the lecture notes and assume that was enough because I had DONE something. However that is definitely NOT ENOUGH. Here's a simple analogy. Just imagine you didn't know how to swim, but you were tasked to swim across an ocean with strong currents and whirlpools aplenty. Would you be able to complete the task by reading a book on how to swim? Of course not. Even if you knew the strokes and motions to do, you hadn't even been thrown into the water to practice the knowledge you've absorbed. Similarly, even if I memorised every single detail in the lecture notes provided, I have not been exposed to the questions and demands of an exam paper. Hence without practice, it would be an insurmountable task to expect an A from just reading the notes alone. (And what are the chances that you actually are able to remember 100% of what you read...) 

So I changed my studying strategies and started off by doing practice questions in tutorials and practice papers WHILE referring to notes to ensure I understood which portion belonged where and the answering techniques for each type of question. After I became more familiar with the content, I began doing papers referring less and less to the lecture notes to build an independence from the notes, rather than an over reliance. As time went by, my results improved and I managed to do decently for the A-Levels. I scored AAB/AAB, 86.25/90, and got into my desired course(s) in University. While these results are not perfect, I am thankful given the results I had just a year ago.

Hence the onus is up to you to ask yourself the ever important question. How effective is your studying?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/izde99/a_levels_the_importance_of_quality_over_quantity/,True,2020-09-25 20:57:51
195,[Rant] Toxic mum?,"Hello everyone, just really need to get something off my chest here because I prefer being anonymous instead of letting anyone around me know how I feel (seriously, with past experiences this is the best way for me)

Okay, I am now in Poly and everything has been great so far. Good company, strong academics and financially comfortable. But I got here mostly by myself (except maybe my dad had indeed helped me with a few things when we were still on good terms)

To get straight to the point, I have never had a good memory with my mum. Eversince I was little, abuse in all forms took place. She even let relatives know matters that should have been kept personal.

So when I was in upper secondary, I took matters into my own hands and did almost everything I could independently. Doing my own chores, took care of my acadmics matters myself, etc. Pretty fortunate to have a dad who would still give me monthly allowance that were more than enough even if we weren't on talking terms. 

Safe to say it has been a good 3 years since I last had a full on conversation with her. I'm saying this because during those 3 years, the 'conversation' she tried to initiate was just her trying to tell me how i should just get out of the house just because I was not gifting her gifts or showing any form of affection towards her just like how my *other sibling* was. My mother displays strong favouritism in this household so you can see where I'm going and probably guess why me and my siblings despise each other.

Anyway, I've started doing things independently on a full scale and because she always has this idea that a daughter should be 'obedient, loyal, etc.' (you all know that mindset), lately she has been talking bad of me directly infront of my dad and *other sibling* as well as asking me to get out of the house just because I do not benefit her in any way.

I've been pretty numb to all her comments for the past few years but I just feel as though enough is enough. She's displaying petty behaviours of a secondary school kid and I can't let sh** like this keep on pulling me down especially since I've got big plans for myself.
 
If anybody was wondering, Yes, I have tried to reconcile our relationship by compromising myself as well as showing her affection but at the end of the day, she seems pretty insistent on just painting my *other sibling* as the golden child. And the more I tried to talk to her, the more she would belittle me during our conversations. My dad pretty much follows her lead and I have no choice but to cut my *other sibling* off because he/she was starting to belittle me as well eventhough I have not interacted/talked with him/her since 2016.

Sigh, Thanks for reading all this way if you did and sorry for all the grammafical errors that I may have overlooked. Also I don't really know how to do those TL:DR?? so sorry about that.

Edit : Just wanna say thank you to everyone who gave kindhearted comments and advices, will definitely look into them. Also, wanna say thank you to those who reached out to me:) Really really appreciate everyone's kind words and help!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ia1tr5/rant_toxic_mum/,True,2020-08-15 21:22:57

197,[A Levels] I sense a possible mental breakdown,"J2 here, just wanted to rant a bit about my current situation. 

During sec sch I was always a last minute cramming kind of student and my mental health really suffered and even if by some miracle I got decent grades (A-C), I felt like I didn’t deserve such grades and would actually feel guilty, considering how some of my peers scored lower than me even when they studied much harder. 

When i entered jc, i decided to leave my last minute cramming behind, although i still last minute crammed for j1 myes, i started to become more consistent towards promos. I could see the improvements i was getting for my various subjects (BCM h1 geog) and was feeling hopeful for promos. Long story short, i fell into a downward spiral of super intense studying, developed an eating disorder and burned out the week before promos. I still remember during the math paper, within the first 10 mins I had a panic attack and felt so nauseous that I wanted to throw up. I couldn’t recover and got a subpass in the end. Ngl it felt awful to see your grades suffer not because you didnt study, but because your mental state couldn’t pull through during the exams.

I ended up seeing a psychologist who I’m very thankful for and continued to pick up my consistency, and discovered new studying methods that was still intensive but gave me ample time to rest my brain. I improved my math and got an A for mcts, and my other subjects either improved or remained the same around Bs. 

Now theres like 33 days or sth to start of As and i feel myself spiralling again. I don’t have much pressure from my parents to do well, but I’m terrified about what’s going to happen if I don’t. I personally don’t think that I’m falling behind in terms of studying, but I find myself struggling to rest properly when it’s time for me to rest. Food makes me nauseous, I’m having indigestion problems, it takes me close to 2 hours to fall asleep at night and I struggle to wake up the next morning (since I fall asleep around 3am) and end up feeling guilty for wasting half a day to sleep. There are nights where I’m just so scared of facing the next day that I just start crying for like 30 mins. I know I’m not alone in this situation but at the same time I feel so alone. 

I’m really scared of burning out or having a mental breakdown during prelims/ As just like how i did for promos last year. I really don’t want my efforts to go to waste but it’s so hard to suppress my emotions that are hindering me from doing well. 

To the other J2s who are about to face the hell hole that is A levels, I wish yall all the best and may we all survive this together!

Edit 1: Well didn’t expect this post to “blow up” LOL but thanks for the advice and encouraging words!! My main prelim papers officially start tmr and I’m kind of nervous but still surviving :) I think I’ll keep editing this post throughout prelims-As period just so I can look back on this post As and laugh AHAHAHAHA Thanks guys for the support!

some background info : i'm a j1 and what does that mean? yes, promos are coming soon weeee i'm not exactly doing very well (ESC/EE for mycts LOL) but i've been trying my very best.

one problem.

my brother (9y/o) has probably the loudest voice on earth and omg i really have no idea how i'm still tolerating it. i'm generally not easily pissed off but ohmygod. and its not like i didn't ask him to lower his volume. but whenever i do he will ""oh so i cannot talk ah ok lor"" and like give me some whiny attitude (tbh r00d but sure)

what about my parents? my mother is heavily addicted to a mobile game and never listens to me. always throwing stuff that she has to do (as a mother) to me. i'm not trying to be a spoilt brat but she literally put her games over us. i used to be super close to my mum and she would know all the friends i have because i always talk to her about them. now i don't even want to waste my energy bc my one sentence has to be repeated more than 3 times as she's not listening. sometimes i'll talk halfway, realise she's not listening and not even bother continuing what i want to say and she doesn't even realise i was trying to talk to her. 

my father? he's aight and im closer to him now because he's the only one that actually cares about what i want to say but he's working almost everyday and i rarely see him.

because of all this, i can't focus that well bc i'm always frustrated and can't rant to anyone about the stress i have in school. yes i have friends but i always thought family comes first so i always relied on them. since the rs between my mum and i is deteriorating, i lack the motivation to even study anymore but i really wanna try and make the most out of my jc life (i didn't want to go jc but got persuaded to by none other than my mother ://)

200,[O levels] it is THEE DAY,"hi guys it is 6:02am as i'm writing this and i'm horrified as most of us are of what is to come very soon. pardon my jumbled thoughts my train of thought becomes rather incoherent at this hour. if you're on this subreddit i think you've seen it all already ; the stories of seniors having their prelim scores halved in Os, the exponential growth, the stories of seniors who exceeded even their own expectations, the ""good job we did it!!!!"" posts, all the ""grades don't define you"" stuff. i mean...there is nothing new to say-there is nothing new you'll find-there is nothing new you can hear. honestly if you're here you're just here to be reassured yet again and to hear things that you've already heard but bring you comfort (no shame in that!! i'm here too yea) to those of us who can't sleep (like me) at this point DON'T you're just going to wake up feeling worse i swearrrr. distract yourself!! watch a mind numbing movie or read something completely pointless but fascinating. or ruminate on your secondary school life, this is after all the last time we will ever be gathered as a batch officially in such a formal setting. this moment essentially connotes the end of your secondary school life which is like high school to us, have your main character coming of age moment *ribs by lorde starts playing* think about how these years passed by quick!! think about how you're going to be freaking 18 next year. i mean if you HAVE to think about this event because your mind simply won't let it go you might as well think of it from a sentimental point of view instead of coming from a place of anxiety. not easy, i know, i'm clinically anxious but hey how often will you get the chance to ponder about such things in a timing as right as this. if you meet or exceed your expectations then how very main character type of satisfying resolve scene of you!! if you don't then...how very main character start of the journey to ultimate success type scene of you!! either way it is not the end of the world (if the simpsons did not predict you doing terribly and then it killing you then you'll be fine!!!!) when all else fails music is always an excellent way to alleviate anxiety, i'll be listening to good days by sza before i go into the classroom to calm myself down. if anyone doesn't know a song that could help then good days is definitely what i recommend.

okay so this was a long paragraph just leading into me promoting sza but you get the point, it may suck now it may not but whatever happens is just temporary...we're all just some atoms floating around in a big universe at the end of the day",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kuooa5/o_levels_it_is_thee_day/,True,2021-01-11 14:25:40
201,[Rant] our bell jars,"I recently read Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar”, and needless to say, it left a massive impact on me. Every subsequent time I broke down, cried, or felt anxious, I thought of that book. I keep a journal, albeit one that I sporadically grace with my writing (it is almost empty, but when I do happen to write, I pour everything out:/). I felt that this entry was rather applicable, seeing as so many people have been feeling so messed up lately. 

So here’s my journal entry (if you can even call it that, it’s more like a vomit of words) + some thoughts(?):

Last night, I cried. I bawled. As the tears flowed out of my eyes, I bombarded myself with horrifying thoughts, most that I never even dare admit are real. After I cried, all I could think was, “Why did I just do that? Why was I so upset? What is wrong?” The answer? Nothing. Nothing is wrong, nothing was wrong, nothing has ever been wrong (for the most part, at least). So why was I crying? To be honest, I don’t know. One thought led to another, and another, and another, and soon I spiralled down into a mass of tears and snot that stained my penguin stuffie (who I now call jackass). Within the span of 10 minutes, I was contemplating my existence and my purpose, questioning every single sliver of my life. 

I often describe my inner world as my mind palace, my alternate dimension, my hideaway. There, I live as (or claim to) my freest form - free of judgement and the weight of the world, where everything is at my fingertips. Everyone has a mind palace, a world inside their heads. But sometimes, my mind palace morphs into a bell jar, trapping me in, becoming an echo chamber of pain. 

This bell jar is a perilous place. Each negative thought uttered, even whispered, is amplified by a thousandfold. The world twists out of proportion and it becomes distorted. This bell jar warps our sense of judgement. We become rash, irrational, anxious, fearful, timid because every single thought we dare to conjure is screamed back at us at full volume. Soon, as it has happened in the past, and as it will happen in the future, it spirals out of control. Each shrivel of negativity takes a massive toll on you. It begins as a whisper, which turns into a word, then contorts into a scream. The tears start to pool, they roll down your face, and they fall. The bell jar has made its mark on the physical realm. 

To make matters worse, each time the bell jar encapsulates you, it gets easier and easier to fall back under. Breakdowns get increasingly frequent, and you start hurting more and more. You cry again and again and again until one day, it all goes numb. What hurts? What doesn’t? Is pain even real? Is joy? The most terrifying thing about the bell jar is that it turns someone apathetic and numb. You’ve been indoctrinated, and you feel like you’ve truly lost. Before, you tried to scream for help, you tried to claw at the glass. Now, you’ve just given up and it feels like no one hears you, because no one can. 

This happens all too frequently. Many people around me suffer through similar circumstances. Especially during this past half a year, I’ve witnessed so many of my friends just turn into someone I barely recognise. Sometimes, it feels impossible to escape from this bell jar, but there are definitely ways to drag yourself out. 

The first, and arguably the most important step, is to realise when your mind palace has morphed into a bell jar. Only then can you remind yourself that your current mental state is blown out of proportion, that your current self is unreasonable and unjust. To everything your mind says, ask yourself, “is this really true? Can I come up with three full, substantial PEEL paragraphs to support my argument?” More often than not, it isn’t, and you can’t. For example, repeatedly failing a subject (wow totally not from personal experience!!). While your mind may tell you that it is the end of the world, deep down, you aren’t actually going to die. Will I die because I can’t read half the chinese lexicon? Nope. Will I get my ass whooped? Maybe. But that’s not the end of the world. Life goes on, tough cookies. 

I personally find that talking to someone is also helpful. I have never been someone who enjoyed confiding in other people very much, so I completely understand that spilling everything out can be exceedingly difficult. But remember when I cried yesterday? The reason I stopped crying is because I forced myself to pick up my phone and wish a friend “happy birthday” (midnight mental breakdowns, am I right?). We started a conversation that pulled my mind off my thoughts. It distracted me and toppled my bell jar over. It allowed me to take my mind off negativity and crawl up the downward spiral. Additionally, I don’t think pouring your heart and soul out to someone is always effective - usually, the other person also has no clue what to do to help you. So as a temporary measure, why not talk to someone that makes you happy?

If you really need to pour out some words, a journal is a great way to vomit out everything you need too! You don’t need a fancy book or anything, just use foolscap paper/ newspaper even if you want (I usually burn my journals/ dispose of them after I’m through with them anyways). The whole idea is to get your feelings out on to a tangible surface so you can read it over and digest your emotions I guess? At least, that’s how it works for me. 

I am certainly not disqualifying crying as a means of stress-relief. In fact, it is proven that crying can be very cathartic! Trust me, I would know. But we need to realise when we are going overboard, when we allow our bell jars to cage us in, and how to break free. If you guys out there have any other methods and tricks to escape your bell jars, please do share them to help out any other potentially distressed folk:)

So yes, thank you for reading my excruciatingly long journal entry-bordering-essay (sorry it became this long, I don’t know how this happened). I highly recommend reading Sylvia Plath’s “The Bell Jar” and hopefully it offers some fresh perspectives for you (what a fun post-exam activity! although, warning, it may wreck you). Lastly, remember to have some fun before you die! After all, what’s life without any enjoyment?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jnby4n/rant_our_bell_jars/,True,2020-11-04 07:12:37
202,[Rant] Regret? I don't know anymore.,"SS, probably a fail. Chem. Fail. English and Math? Maybe a pass? Fuck. I don't even know what to say. Part of me wants to blame Covid for killing my motivation but the other part of me knows it is my procrastination that's digging my grave. Even so, I still waited till last 2 months to actually try and study. And still I'm struggling with procrastination. 

Now here's the result. I'm probably never gonna get into the course I want since my EAE failed horribly. (And I FUCKING TRIED SO HARD) My POA is a complete failure and I know I'm not getting anything good within this 2 days before the exam. My bio is shaky at best and my history and art are probably the only subjects yet to come that I have a tiny bit of confidence in. 

The thing is, my parents have spent alot of money to help me with tuition. I know it helps because I would be even worse off without it, but I will never live up to their expectations. I could already see and hear the utter disappointment my mother would have towards me and my father just ignore me out of anger. But what can I do now? I've messed up bad and I've got to live with it. And naturally it feels like shit. How can I even face my family members back in China if they ever ask me about my studies. Even if I put that aside, I don't even know what I want to do now after olvls. 

And now right after the disaster that was chem, I'm here venting my frustrations on fucking reddit. I feel like a failure. And yea I also know this fucking essay is the very embodiment of a pretentious prick, and fuck it I'll just live with it, what good can I do anyway, fuck. 

Maybe I'll feel better after gethering my thoughts. Yea. Fucking hell this year is shit.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jisihs/rant_regret_i_dont_know_anymore/,True,2020-10-27 18:04:10

204,"[A Levels] HBL Resources (Papers, Lecture Notes, Questions)","So the government issued school closures for a month and this could be highly disruptive to students with national examinations this year. So i decided to help students make this time more meaningful by providing whatever resources i could find online and allow them to maximize their effectiveness of their learning now. This is mainly for A-Levels might do a O-Levels one soon. Everything is for educational purposes only.

Some Tips - For maths, i assume most of pure is covered so you can start doing P1 of Prelim papers alr. For chemistry, its mainly organic now so might want to start learning OTOT using the notes that i provided or online one. Questions try practice using TYS. For physics, same thing try learn using lecture notes and practice with TYS. For economics, it depends, might want to start doing essay questions or even CSQ if Macro or Micro is already fully covered.

206,[A Level] Beware of GP Model Essay site,"I don't usually post on Reddit pages but I realised that many JC students here do buy notes online and may fall for potentially misleading ads/sellers. I came across this promoted website https://gpessays.sg/ on Reddit and Carousell. It highlights that the (model) essays were made by students from RI and HCI. 

However, after getting a subscription (for my daughter) and reading through the essays, I realised

1. The essays were only written by RI students, despite being (falsefully) marketed as model essays written by both RI and HCI students.

2. Based on my research, there is a positive review written on the website which is likely written by the owner himself/herself. There is only one review on the website itself. This can really mislead buyers into getting them.

3. There is no prove that these essays are ""model essays"" as the writer/owner just claims that the many essays are ""A"" grade. To add on to the suspicion, many essays were written on 2020, as stated on the website. As JC as has started, I wonder who gave the A grades to the many essays from the same few people. 

4. Some of the arguments presented in the essay were hastily developed and contained weakly substantiated points to be model essays, when you compare them with like KSBULL. However, kindly note that this point here is very subjective.

All in all, I hope this information can encourage you to be more careful (of unethical sellers/marketing) when you are making note purchases to prepare for your studies. Ask more questions to the sellers and do more research before making purchases.

I have contacted the seller as I felt cheated and I am awaiting for a reponse. Hopefully the seller can rectify the issue at hand. If the seller does not reply, is there any way to escalate/resolve the matter? Would like to hear your thoughts about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f0xcnv/a_level_beware_of_gp_model_essay_site/,True,2020-02-09 12:39:01
207,[Jobs] Giving of Examples During Job Interviews,"Update: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support. I did not expect this to get so popular but this only makes me more certain that there is a need for more discussion knowledge with regards to jobs related topics! I'll be penning down more random thoughts of mine jobs wise in near future! 

Hello my fellow redditors (again!) I've noticed that there has been many posts on career advices, career paths, career interests, specialisations so far but there has not been as many discussion/posts with regards to job interviews.

***Imagine this.*** You've studied hard, studied smart, burnt all that midnight oil, squeezed every bit of brain juice out of you to achieve your final grades and graduate. And then what? You start looking for jobs and you realise that it is not straight forward as you imagine it to be. That there are no model answers for you to refer to when it comes to your job interview.

The question then is how do you sell yourself to a potential employer and make them really see what you are worth? Imagine that you are a good plate of Nasi Lemak. You know you are really delicious and yummy and people would love you. BUT people are not flocking to eat you not because you taste awful, but because you've not packaged yourself to the best of your true potential. With the right packaging, you could be a $15 restaurant quality Nasi Lemak and stand out from the rest of your Nasi Lemak peers who are averaging $3-$5.

That is what I'm trying to raise awareness about with my series of random jobs related post. And today I'm sharing something basic that most of you would have heard/know of but often forget to apply in job interviews.

When applying for jobs, you **NEED** to give examples if you can; it's one thing saying ""I would do ..."" but it's much more impactful to say ""I did ..."". (**think about it: would you prefer to board the plane being helmed by someone who would fly it vs someone who did fly it before?**)

Using this simple technique, your job interview hit rates have just been given a boost (Hooray?)

I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help if you've been finding that you haven't been having much success so far.

A simple template to use could be **C.A.R (CONTEXT-  ACTION - RESULT)** or **S.T.A.R (SITUATION - TASK - ACTION - RESULT)**

Now let's see an example.

>Question: ""What is your approach to dealing with conflict resolution?""  
>  
>Answer:  
>  
>**Context**: ""Working as a  student receptionist at my school's office after classes, I recall a time where a student came in really aggressive and angry because his school fees was not processed on time.""  
>  
>**Action**: ""I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so.""  
>  
>**Result**: ""The student left happy, came back with the right documents and was happy knowing his payment would be processed correctly this time."".

This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

Follow the advice above - figure out what skills and life experiences you have that would make you an excellent engineer/analyst/graphics designer/writer/doctor/teacher/any role you are applying for really.

Also, do a search on the common interview questions for said position - after looking at a few lists, you should get a pretty general sense of what you might be asked. They might also ask you to tell them about yourself, or what are your greatest strengths / weaknesses or other universal questions.

Write out the answers

***Memorize, memorize, memorize and/or practice, practice, practice***

With maybe 10-15 good ""answers"" ingrained in you, you should be in pretty good shape to answer most things that get thrown at you. If the question doesn't quite match your answer, then rephrase it and answer your question accordingly. Adaptation is the key here.

Figure out several good questions to ask the interviewer and memorize those too, and you should be good to go. (This is another post for another day!)

Don't forget to know at least a little bit about what the company does, and what sorts of things you might be expected to do and who would you be interacting with on a daily basis.

Also, treat it like a first date - you are clean, well groomed, wearing appropriate clothing (dress up a notch if in doubt), be polite and on your best behavior. Relate, if possible, to the interviewer.

Otherwise, it is usually just a conversation - they ask questions, you answer, then you will get a chance to ask a few questions too.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional career coach nor do I make money from this. A lot of this is from my personal experience/observations so far in my career that I have found incredibly helpful for me. Coming as an average student (barely average admittedly), I had to find ways to market myself better than the others and get the attention of employers. I hope some of you find this helpful at least and please feel free to facilitate any discussion and point out other job related topics you are interested/curious in that I could potentially share in the future if I have knowledge of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kars3h/jobs_giving_of_examples_during_job_interviews/,True,2020-12-11 16:42:11
208,[Uni] The stress to be productive,"For some context, I've studied in sg my whole life, and I graduated jc last year and am awaiting to enter uni. So you can say that I am a rare breed to find on this thread during this period of time, as covid has had the least impact on my batch's academic life. These are just some thoughts that've been swimming around in my head during this long break that I've had, the longest in 12 years of intense academic rigour.

Singapore has definitely inculcated a 'kiasu' culture into me where my mind has categorised all my actions into 2 groups: what is 'productive' towards my growth in academics and what is not. I tend to feel immense guilt whilst watching Netflix, munching on snacks and scrolling through social media, and the guilt increases exponentially with the time spent on such activities. This is further perpetuated by my mother's incessant ""You've been on your phone for too long!"" (somehow right after I do something 'productive'). I always felt the need to hide my 'unproductive' activities from view, so as to structure this image of a robot who studies endlessly with no breaks in between (unrealistic as that may be), because every break felt like too much. Eventually a spiral of shame and self-loathing would ensue, and I told myself I deserved every bad grade I got (or would get, because I was so convinced that I was going to do badly before I even took the test).

But during this break I have before university, I felt less guilt for these actions of mine for the first time in 12 years, because there was no severe consequence to my academic portfolio in the near future. I came to the revelation that instead of narrow-mindedly compartmentalising these ideas of what is 'productive' and what is not into boxes, I should instead be more focused on my **growth** as an individual. Who is to say there are no benefits to video games? There are generally less benefits to video games than studying in terms of academics, but in the overall scheme of things, I realised I needed to start seeing my priorities as part of a spectrum rather than the end-all. And I feel like university life (or at least my impressions of it) is vastly different from previous years of schooling in sg in the sense that networking, being socially conscious, etc is viewed to be every bit as important as academics in order to maximise chances of success in the working world. This is because the persistent goal of our early school years (for Singaporean children with typical working-class parents) is getting into a 'good' university/course in poly, and this subsides once university/poly plans are set in stone. This incessant focus on academics from an early stage in life may be well-meaning, but is also near-sighted and potentially damaging. Perhaps this is most evident in several teachers I have had, who have obtained PhDs in their fields of study, but are unable to reduce complex concepts into bite-sized pieces for students, and unable to build enough rapport with students to understand, accept and work through their confusion. They were once children with a strong focus on academics too. And they definitely succeeded in that field, but lost their human connection somewhere along the line, because they failed to prioritise human communication and connection above academic achievements. We absorb knowledge and habits like a sponge in our formative years, and it is extremely difficult to change our mindset once we enter adulthood. But I urge us all to stay hungry, fear stagnation, and continually grow as an individual, in **mind and spirit.**

TL;DR: growing as an individual is much more essential than ensuring that you are doing something 'productive' at all times. Take everything in your life as an opportunity for self-improvement, no matter how 'inane' or 'useless' society may deem them to be. There is good to be found in everything, and everyone.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hn0bwa/uni_the_stress_to_be_productive/,True,2020-07-08 10:39:39
209,[A Levels] For JC Students/ Prospective JC Students,"Hey guys,

**Who am I?**

I'm someone who has some time before Uni Starts (took A Levels in 2018). Meanwhile, I thought it would be possible for me to share some tips that I found useful to do well for the A Levels. I took 4 H2 (PCME), H1 GP, H1 PW, H1 Chinese (on 1st year cause I didn't take HMT in Sec Sch). I took up H3 Math in J2, but decided to drop it because I wanted to spend more time on General Paper instead. I also come from a neighbourhood secondary school before I went to JC. (PSLE Score 220-230).

I have a series/channel where I share more tips on various subjects/ general study tips but I don't think I am allowed to advertise here, so if you want to know more about my study tips feel free to pm me :). Personally don't want to put all my time sharing on a text medium cause it's just going to get lost in a sea of texts which makes me feel like I waste my time in the long run haha so that's why I'm using a channel, hopefully to reach a larger audience for a longer period of time.

So let's get started :

O Level Results: Raw 8 (6 A1, 1 B3, 1 A2) \[Took 8 Subjects, 8th being Pure Geography\]

Now lemme jump to the A Levels part:

***My Grades for A Levels (87.5/90) :***

***Disclaimer:***

\- ***I only had Maths tuition cause I really liked the subject and wanted to explore more on it. Just wanted to put my results there so hopefully I can add more weigh to the things I say maybe (can't advise for GP...)***

**Top 3 Tips I have to share :**

***1.Don't underestimate the jump from Os to As***

\- When I first entered JC I had quite a shock with my first few class tests. I was scoring 9-10/20 for my Physics class tests, and I think for my first chem test I got like 3/20 or something LOL so it really came as quite a shock to me, but of course not everyone will be like that. There was certainly a jump from O Lvls to A Lvls content but I think I got quite used to it after like 2-3 months. (It all depends on how much hard work you want to put in at the start).

\- One big reason was because I was quite disicplined and I didn't want to lag behind at the start because A Levels was just a very short 2 years. If I lagged behind at the start it will eventually snowball on me and I may find it too difficult to catch up for the A Levels. But as always A Levels is a 'Marathon', not a 'Sprint', so you don't want to go too hard at the start and burn yourself out towards the end. I just did my due dilligence in school, and kept up with the content at school. I didn't want to spend time lazing around in school and then use home time to catch up later, and used my time meaningfully. My CCA was Students' Council so I also had to be involved in quite a few planning activities for the school, so I really made efficient use of my time especially in studying. Basically I didn't go in with the '1st year honeymoon' mindset and wanted a strong start from the beginning. However, you shouldn't drown yourself in studying and find time to engage in hobbies/ socialise with friends, cause I found JC life much more fun that Sec Sch :D.

***2. Studying SMART --> Active Recall and Spaced Repetition (Especially useful for content heavy subjects)***

\- I was a huge crammer back in the day, where I would literally cram the whole textbook right before exams. Usually your exams end in the morning, maybe like 11am? Then I would grab lunch with friends, and crammed the WHOLE DAY+NIGHT away from like 1pm to 11pm\~2am (depending on how much content there was). It was really torturous, and the breaking point for me was when my school introduced Organic Chemistry. I still remember from the March Tests in J2, I studied from like 12pm to 4am, and did another last grind from 5.30am to like 7am, and man I still couldn't finish studying the content that I need since I just simply couldn't remember all the dam equations and all the reactions. Man was literally going crazy. Managed to get a B but it was just so dam torturous that I decided that cramming is no longer the way to go, especially since I have MORE content to go! After searching,

\- I found the gem study method called Active Recall and Spaced Repetition. This method was the best study method I found, especially for Organic Chemistry, since there were simply way too many compounds and reactions that I had to remember. I made a video about how I use this personally but I don’t think I’m allowed to share here, pm me if you wanna know more!

\- Basically it is where you try to test yourself the content, and try to retrieve the answer from your mind instead of reading the answer, so through the process it will form stronger connections in your brain so you can remember the content more easily (Active Recall). Then you revisit the content at increasing intervals to help you save time as while as to ensure that the content remains fresh in your mind (Spaced Repetition). It really saved me a lot of time studying for subjects, I wish I had found this out earlier in my JC life instead of at J2.

***3. It is never too late to start***

\- Like I said in Point 2. I only found out this awesome study method at J2. I saw how good it was, and I got into the grind and believed in the grind. During my March holidays (after tests), I was spending 9am to 6pm almost everyday making notes based on Active Recall + Spaced Repetition for all the subjects, all while doing my homework and keeping up with new content in school. This making notes progress continued until like June/July, can't really remember anymore, and I still couldn't finish all of them up, but it really served me well especially for remembering my content (Physics, Chemistry, Econs). So if you had read the post/found out this study method early on, your chances of success would be much much higher. Nonetheless, it is never too late to start, as you see I only really started this study method at J2 March period.

**Conclusion:**

\- I wanna reiterate that I never had tuition for the subjects above except Maths (cause I really liked the subject and wanna explore more on it, on hindsight maybe shld've gotten GP tuition instead LEL). I was just more **dilligence and dedicated**, and found **the right study method**, and I think these were the reasons for my success in A Levels (except GP I guess...).

\- I am actually starting a series where I elaborate more on A Levels and the subjects respectively, and trying to provide more tips towards exams/learning the content, but I think such self-promotion isn't allowed on this reddit? **If you do want to find out more you can pm me :) (If it is allowed maybe I could just link a video of mine on Active Recall + Spaced Repetition, cause I really found this study technique super useful to remember content)**

\- I hope you guys found these tips useful. If you came all the way down to the end, thanks a lot for reading this, and all the best in your JC Life :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kvnjra/a_levels_for_jc_students_prospective_jc_students/,True,2021-01-13 00:12:35
210,[Rant]Why do parents even send their child for music/art lessons,"5 years ago, my sister quit piano. I was tempted to do the same but didn’t. 

It was still okay at first. But with my studies becoming more and more draining, the urge to quit intensified. I don’t think I can cope with piano grade8 next year since I’m going to jc so I told my mum I wanted to quit.

She called me lazy and all that and she scolded me. 

I hate piano. Really, I see no point in piano. What is it gonna help me with? My parents kept on telling me that taking piano lessons are good since it is a plan B and I can be a piano teacher if I have no jobs. They might be living in lala land, because to be a piano teacher means you would have to put in a lot of effort into practicing and learning, I don’t think when I reach adulthood I’ll be able to do that. It’s gonna help me relax and work as a hobby? Just like how all those self help books say? Nope , I am even more stressed when I think of my piano lessons. 

During these lessons, all I think about it when it’ll end and through the reflection of the piano board, I’m always glancing at the clock thinking when it’ll end.

I’m just tired. Why do parents guilt trip so much? They act like they care about you a lot and hence want you to take these classes, but I think they just care about me in their imagined ways, like I’m not a complex being like them with my own thoughts. Plus my mum is so upset and disappointed, when she doesn’t even pay for these classes. 

She doesn’t know. My future is at stake. I don’t wanna screw up a levels. I’m relaxing so hard this holiday because I know things won’t be sunshine and rainbow from now on. I’ll have to be an adult, a levels and uni will drain me mentally, I won’t have holidays like this anymore,so please, just this one last time , let me do my thing.

I have been bottling up this urge for many years,however after letting them out, I don’t think I feel something off my chest. I can sense more scoldings, looks of disappointment, and guilt coming in my way

213,[rant] what to do now,"idk how reddit rly works IDK IF I ADDED THE CORRECT FLAIR OR NOT UMM !!!! i know this is reALLY RANDOM but As ended for me on monday (helm) and im already hating being at home :(

for context this year has been a rather weird and generally unhappy year because of covid, which led me to losing like 2-3 weeks of school before prelims when my fam got dengue and everyone had to sort of take turns getting covid swabbed (a few times for my sister) but besides that my relationship with my mom has gotten super super strained

it started with this incident with my laptop which i put on a chair and then my sister didnt know that my laptop was in the bag on the chair so she sort of threw it down and it cracked so i couldn't use the touchscreen anymore. Take this with the fact that this was leading up to prelims too and i was super stressed with all the work I had to catch up on abd that incident just made me break down [ for more context: that was the first laptop i owned to myself and was given to me for free by a bunch of really sweet people during covid so idk it made it even sadder ig]. SO anyways i broke down and started crying rly hard and my mom who saw the whole exchange btwn me and my sister was like "" Why are you crying?"" and i told her and she said i should jave taken care of it better but the thing is that I did i put in its bag but my sister (whos like 12) absentmindedly just threw it down when i was on my room so technically its really just an accident bah but it doesnt mean i cant be upset about it right? like the crack was pretty obvious also. then she basically told me that ""since it's nobodys fault, you dont need to cry. why are you crying? just take it as a lesson"" and i tried explaining to her that IM UPSET (she kept gg back and forth that i dont have a reason to cry) before i just point blank told her "" if you dont understand, then its okay,"" then i went into my room like i really was trying to JUST CRY and i shes asking me so many questions like what lesson do i TAKE FROM THIS + she didng even try to CONSOLE ME then might as well dont right 

anyways, from the next day she started ignoring me. like no cap just straight up ignored me and i didn't think it was anything wrong because i honestly didn't think that anything i wouldve said wouldve hurt her feelings or wtv... like cmon i didnt even say anything about her and i didn't think it was a big deal. + i was also more concerned about traumatising my younger sister when she thought she screwed up my lappy so i didn't talk about it at all afterwards. like even my dad didnt know what the sudden hostility was like until i prodded him to ask her and he said its because of the incident

i lowkey was furious because its so freaking petty and I felt like i didnt say anything wrong AND it was prelims szn so in my mind i was like lol sure she can ignore me imma just focus on studying so when she wouldnt talk to me id just pretend i didn't notice and did my work/ stay in school longer etc but it rly affected me for sure like all the changes i had to make to feel unaffected rly stands until today --> cant stand being in the same room at all because it makes me super super super uncomfy + my rship w my grandma also sort of deteriorated because of it

ANYWAYS, the Alevels period and school rly helped me to take my mind off of my mom and the horrible rship that we have. i dont think we ever had a great rship to begin with ever since she mocked me for self harm in sec school but i think most ppl in my fam would agree that ive tried rly hard over the years to make the rship work for the rest of my fam but she rly undid it by choosing to ignore me for months now and i dont rly feel like trying anymore? i think even the rest of my fam has accepted that its a lil irreconcilable since my mom is so unbending and imo petty af but since As ended its been rly bad cos ive been cooped up at home and trying not to breal down because of her and its so weird to just wait for her to go into her room to do my chores. i even found a 10 hr job to start THIS Saturday which i lowket regret since i wont have much time to meet up w ppl who end papers later but i really cant stand it 

does anyone have any advice as to how i should deal w this situation,,,, imma be honest at first i tried to be normal and talk but she rly ignored me WHEN i was talking to her,,,, bUT ANYWAYS idk what i can do because like even if i didnt get a job id need to get money to do pretty much anything. it's just so weird im like living in constant anxiety or smtg

if u made it to the end of this essay i appreciate u with all my heart💓 i think As end for most ppl this week and if youre one of them enjoy a restful weekend ~

[Edit: thank uuu guys for all ur replies!! my hearteu feels v warm! i didn't know a lot of ppl faced similar incidents,,, tyvm for sharing :D i went to gramps todays and felt a lot better hanging out w my extended family for a lil while ! hopefully things get better and hAPPY weekend 🌟]",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k1sr7r/rant_what_to_do_now/,True,2020-11-27 18:38:32
214,[A Levels] Peaked at secondary school cant even lift a pen up in JC,"Welcome to my life

Used to tryhard so much in secondary school, got a above average results felt good. Everyone called me the 'smart' kid.

Now in jc, I suck at everything feeling depressed. Cant even study for my promos. This feeling keeps coming at me almost every day or every other day for the past 9 months. I keep telling myself I'll get better and work harder, but every time I try to study I either get depressed or try to find something to keep myself happy.  I like to call it selfcare but let's be real I'm just avoiding my problems.

I feel more anxious and sad this year. Every time I try to sleep, I think about what I haven't studied. I worry about it to do the point it sometimes feels difficult to sleep. If I let these thoughts in my head, i feel like freaking out. I feel like my entire future is going to end horribly and idw to think about that. So i blank my head out when i think about school. It's either i get all of these thoughts at once or I'm just pretending i don't go school at all, that i have nothing to worry about.

I did a shit load of positive shit(journaling, appreciation writing, positive quotes, walking out) so i can get better study but i always drop back to level 0, to the loser i've become. I told myself i would do even better in jc, my teachers said that i would be successful no matter which  school i go. But now im here being absolutely unhappy. And the worse part is talking to my secondary school teachers again and meeting the other 'smart' kids that got good grades, they say jc is good to them and they look at me weirdly when i tell them jc is terrible for me. (lol maybe i should have just said its fine.). Sometimes i think i get depressed so i dont have to face reality, sometimes i think im well off than everyone else so idk why im getting depressed? i feel like a fake depressed person. I know what yall think, ofc that jc will be harder and you cant expect to be easier, well i never did. and i do study but not enough. Well i have to admit i was sad in secondary school but not like to the point where i feel surreal, that i cant even think straight. But dont think im going to kill myself. I made a new years resolution to not think about kmsing this year. So far i did feel like it but i never let myself have such thoughts or act upon it. i dont plan to either.

When i go school, i am a functional person.  But suddenly sometimes, i get so depressed that i cant participate in class, that i just want to cry but i cant in class.  it feels so hard to even answer a damn question the teacher asks.  Currently, there is not much that makes me happy. In fact, i feel like there isn't any.  My family is wack, my parents loathe each other but dont want to get a divorce, they are typical asian parents who dont show any emotions whatsoever. They rely on me alot cuz im first gen in our house and prolly gonna end up being a sole breadwinner. Our relationship is so shit, people wont even think we are a family. I cant even tell them anything.

Look, I'm not blind to how I'm feeling i went to my school counsellor (but I didn't tell her everything cuz ion wan her calling my parents down) on the first month of jc. After having a stress breakdown cuz of my sister, She skipped school for 2 weeks cuz she's depressed at school and that got me worried af couple that with jc workload and bam you get a emotional breakdown. (she goes to school now and feels way better now) Told my counsellor about this, she gave me good advice. I met her a couple times later, it was good talking to her. After talking to her, it always felt like i was going to get better but then look where we are , at level 0.  I feel like a pendulum in my physics practical, im always oscillating between this emotions but then again i suck at physics and the pendulum swings in the wrong mode without going up and that's how it feels for the recent months. There is no up. dumbass analogy ik. You could say go to a therapist, but i aint rich nor will my parents understand mental health. They are already financially troubled i don't see the reason to be even more burden to them. Simply to put they will and wont understand my problems.

Im just ranting to you reader. don't have to put the suicide hotline or anything, i read enough books to know for sure that i wont kms. I'm living but i feel quite empty. odd bloke innit, now that i think about it i probably bet my self-worth on the grades i got. i mean im used to getting fails but i always tried hard to get back to an A. But now i cant even do anything.  I don't think i have depression because i feel like it would be way worse. It feels like i have sadboi hours a lot. I apologise if im assuming what a mental illness be like.

So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both sad and sad and I'm still trying to figure out how that could be.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iywc8x/a_levels_peaked_at_secondary_school_cant_even/,True,2020-09-25 04:30:38
215,[Poly] My O-level to ITE to Poly Journey + Tips,"Hi everyone! I'm writing this post to share my experience and tips from O-level to ITE to Polytechnic.

Disclaimer: This is MY experience and MY tips that I have found useful throughout MY journey. You may use these as a reference guide but take this with a pinch of salt.

Background: I did not do well for O-levels and I'm talking double-digit points. Honestly, I had a really rough time in secondary school and I couldn't get myself together. So, I ended up in ITE doing Higher Nitec in Accountancy.

**O-Level**

I took E-Maths, Combined POA and Geography, English, Higher Malay, Malay, Pure Physics, and Pure Chemistry. I did not do well for all of it except for maybe English, Maths and Malay where I got C6, B4 and B4 respectively. I barely studied and eventhough I received tuition, I really still couldn't turn my studies around. I even ended up not taking my Physics paper because I just hated it.

During my O-level result collection, I thought I was going to get like a 20+ or something. Lo and behold, my results were truly horrible. While my other classmates were jumping and had multiple lines of JC and Poly courses, I had none and only ITE courses. I was the last one to leave my school hall that day and I stayed there for 4 hours.

**ITE**

So eventually, I had to make a decision and thankfully, I managed to get into Higher Nitec in Accountancy which is only 2 years. Course-wise, it is actually quite tough so you need to be hardworking and persistent. You need to do past papers and practice a lot so that you are able to predict the questions and actually be mentally prepared for it. PLEASE WRITE NOTES!  And for my fellow ITE students who are eyeing for a spot in local poly, YOU HAVE A CHANCE. Don't expect to get into poly when you don't work hard for it because it is competitive but it is achievable. For poly courses, please refer to the catalogue on GPA requirements for ITE students to apply for admission into Poly. For Higher Nitec in Accountancy to Banking and Finance, my requirement was 2.9 which is my first 5 semesters GPA in 2017. Initially, I got rejected despite meeting the requirement and posted to my 2nd choice but I appealed into my 1st choice and got in anyway.

Friends-wise, I met a group of like-minded girls who wanted to go to poly so we all pushed each other and taught each other. Those stories of typical ITE kids? Yeah, they exist too but it is always up to you whether you want to mix with them or not.

Teacher-wise, I met the best teachers in my entire life in ITE. I would do anything to have them again because it was the sweet spot between being coddled like a secondary school kid and allowed to make your own decisions as a young adult. My teachers never gave up on me no matter how stupid and repetitive my questions got and were happy with my successes. They checked up on us always (and also our uniform) and I miss it dearly.

ITE Summary: Be hardworking, choose your friends, your teachers care for you so don't disrespect them it's not cool

**Poly**

As previously mentioned, I got into Banking and Finance. When I tell you that poly is extremely different, please believe me and be mentally prepared. Firstly, I am a 20> pointer for O-level against single-digit pointers. You can only imagine how I felt on the first day of school amongst a sea of smart kids (like literally, I am 2 years older but don't laugh, you will feel the difference).

1. Year 1

I struggled. If I had to describe how I felt in one word, it would be death. I had 12 modules in year 1 such as Accounting, Statistics and Economics. I struggled so much and god, I wished someone had told me how hard the transition was going to be. If you're not good at Math, Statistics will absolutely murder you. In Year 1 Semester 2, my grades had improved and I attribute my improvement to a change in my studying method.

2. Year 2

My Year 2 was equally as hard as Year 1. One thing that I really had to learn was time management because a lot of project timelines can clash. This is made even more difficult when you have to consider when should you start studying for your exams. There were also 12 modules in year 2 so it really was a hectic year for me.

3. Year 3

Sem 1 Internship: I did my internship in a local bank for 6 months and it was a good learning experience for me. I got to attend meetings and contribute to projects. My tips would be to ask questions and take the initiative to ask for more things to do. It will really make your experience more fulfilling. Get a letter of recommendation as well from your supervisor at the end of your internship.

Sem 2: Finally the last lap! My last 6 modules including the legendary FYP. During this semester, I was burnt out. My teammate and I carried our 4-member group for FYP while balancing 5 other modules at the same time. For some reason, the semester felt shorter and more rushed than normal. At this last point of your poly life, just push through and put in your best effort. I lacked sleep, lost weight from irregular meals and my skin was horrible. But I just held on tight and put my best effort until my final paper.

**School Essential Tips**

1. If you have a Macbook with USB C, I highly recommend an adapter especially for presentations because the common pointers use a USB A and you will need to plug in HDMI or VGA cable few times in your poly life. Also, if your presentations have audio, you need a hole for that too.
2. Get a pointer from Shopee or Carousell. I got a knockoff for $11 and it works. If you can't afford it, borrow from another group with prior permission.
3. Bring your laptop charger to school always and mouse (if needed). For phones, I highly recommend you to bring a spare charger and cable than to plug in and out your home-use charger.
4. Find out what reference format your course is using e.g. Harvard, APA etc. In a pinch (but tbh for most of the time for me), I use citethisforme website to mass upload links and it will generate the reference for me
5. If you need icons or graphics for your slides, search for ""icon websites"" that offer FREE PNG files
6. Prepare 1 or 2 sets of formal wear. It really doesn't have to be expensive (carousell, shopee, uniqlo or h&m sales) but it has to be presentable and ironed. This will last you all 3 years even during intern. *Safe outfit 1:* long-sleeve buttoned shirt, formal pants/black skirt, blazer (optional but would definitely recommend for cold classrooms) and black flats.                                *Safe outfit 2:* long-sleeved buttoned shirt, belt, formal pants, blazer (i would say this is compulsory but you can always lend someone else's) and black formal shoes.
7. Find your tried and true stationery and stock up! I highly recommend you to carry around post-its because it's good for pasting on your computer. Although there are post-its apps on your computer, when your computer dies, you can't access it
8. Everyday wear: for the most part, you can dress however you want in poly. But nearing exams, you can expect yourself to be in comfy clothes for long hour days and finals prep e.g. shirt, shorts, the famous pants from Bangkok and slippers/slides
9. For my makeup-wearing friends, you can wear a full-face or even minimal makeup or no makeup at all. Carry some blotting sheets and maybe some lipstick to touch up.
10. Buy concession pass because you can use it unlimited times in a month. Please google for the updated price. Also, your poly ez-link card is sooooo important for student meals, haircuts, movies etc so please carry it everywhere.

**Study/Project Tips**

1. Come to class as much as possible. I know some days it's so hard to wake up or sometimes the day is too long but try to tahan. If you really want to skip, please ensure you are extremely on top of your attendance rate plus the requirement because it isn't nice for your name to be flagged for attendance.
2. Work hard!
3. Find a studying method that works for you and your go-to study spot (i studied in school but wherever you feel like it works for you, stick to it.)
4. WRITE NOTES: I rewrote my notes until they were perfect and it ended up helping me to memorize better.
5. DO YOUR PAST PAPERS AGAIN AND AGAIN (this is super important especially if you are a last-minute chiongster)
6. For practice papers, please time yourself using your clock every single attempt. For me, I aim to finish a 2-hour paper in 1 hour 30/40 mins to allow myself time to check and just relax
7. Ask questions
8. Do your tutorials
9. If you are a slow learner like me, please review your lecture notes and tutorials before your classes start. You might not understand but at least you prep yourself to be tortured.
10. For projects, PLEASE DO NOT BE LAZY. I feel like no one ever mentions this but *your reputation as a teammate actually matters and it goes around.* If you are lazy and don't put in the effort, your reputation will follow and people will be reluctant to have you as a teammate. For certain modules, there are peer evaluations and do not underestimate the power of words because students will not be afraid to express their anger and frustration about lazy group mates. Although peer evaluation makes up 5-10% of your assignment, this can make you go from a B to C+.
11. SAVE YOUR PROJECTS AND REPORTS TO YOUR DESKTOP IF NEEDED. I can't tell you how many times I forgot where I saved my documents so just put it where you can see them
12. Time-management will be something that you need to learn and use because you will be required to complete so many projects on top of preparing for exams
13. For exams, please bring your calculator, stationery, spectacles, and a watch because sometimes, invigilators don't show the time and you're left wondering how much time you have left (this was a hard lesson for me)

**Social/CCA/Life/Other Tips**

1. You don't need a lot of friends. If you do have a clique, great. But if you don't and just end up with a solid 1-2 friends, it is alright too. Throughout my 3 years, I chose to only be close to 2 friends because I did not want drama.
2. You can join CCA/interest groups if you want! It looks good on your portfolio. But remember to manage your time well. I personally did not have any CCA or part-time job so I was able to spend more time studying and resting
3. Do fun things! If you are legal, a night's out with your friends after exams is such a bonding experience. KBBQ, karaoke, day trips to JB or staycations in SG are other fun ways to bond. If you are an introvert, you can just stay home, Netflix and just bond with your loved ones. School will take a lot of your time but remember to set aside time to have some fun and ease your tensions.
4. If you are in need of extra money to supplement you and your family, do check out your school's financial aid. There are bursaries and scholarships available.

Finally, it is possible to pull up your GPA to 3.0 but from my experience and in my opinion, you need to either have a close to 3.0 GPA at the beginning of Year 1 or you need to work your butt to get majority As for the remaining semesters especially 6 and 4 credit modules. I had a 2.75 and managed to get a 3.08 GPA for my final GPA.

PS: you can PM me if you have any other questions like what was my studying method etc. I'm open to all questions! Just here to help out others

216,[Rant] absolutely 0 hope now,"Math o level is tomorrow and it feels like I'm not gonna do well at all. I studied the hardest I've ever had during these few weeks but I feel like I studied enough only to move a grade up for each subject and that's it. I honestly don't care where I end up because I don't have any real or valid dreams, I'm just scared of showing my face at home. I know people around me are gonna say ""expected"" or ""I caused it"". 

I honestly just really need a hug right now.

Well, all the best to everyone taking Os tomorrow, hope y'all would be able to enter your dream schools 💕

217,[O levels] Study tips I wish I knew,"Hi, J1 here and I've been seeing quite a lot of posts about sec 4s being distracted/unmotivated to study recently, so I'm here to share some study tips that I now use and I should've used for O levels prep.


1: Proper studying environment. Don't study on bed or sofa, you will feel tired. Get a proper study desk, clean it up and make it neat. This will get you in the right mood to study. Have everything you'll need for your study session like stationery, calculator, notes, water, etc. The trick here is to prevent yourself from getting out of your chair, to minimise distractions. 


2: White noise. If you find yourself distracted a lot while studying, this can help you. I use an app called ""tide"", where you can play different white noises e.g. ocean waves sounds, rain sounds, library sounds, and time yourself while you study. I get distracted very easily because my study table is in the middle of my noisy house, so I just wear bluetooth earbuds and play ocean sounds to drown out the noise. It really helps me. Sometimes when I can't even sit still for 10 minutes, white noise can help me focus for hours.


3: Put your phone away. Don't study with your phone on the table, even the sight of it can distract you. Even one notification can send you down hours of scrolling through your phone. So set your phone to silent and put it far away. That's why I use bluetooth headset, so I don't need my phone to be close to me. 


4: Study techniques. You can try using the pomodoro technique, there are also pomodoro apps to time yourself (tide has pomodoro feature). It may not work for everyone, but you can give it a try. 
25 mins study, 
5 mins break, 
repeat previous 2 steps a few times, 
15 mins break, 
repeat previous 4 steps as many times as you want. 


5: Understand that you may feel unprepared. Even if you studied very hard and have been consistent throughout sec 4, you most likely will feel unprepared when O level comes. This is normal, I also felt that way. What you can do is just maximise the time you have left to study now, minimise your distractions and be productive. 

That's all, if you have anything to add on, go ahead. All the best!

Edit: 
6: For those of you discouraged by your prelim results, I challenge you to surprise yourself when you get your actual O level results. Prelim results don't always indicate how well you will do for O levels. I have friends who jumped from C5 to A2 in physics. How? they decided to make full use of the time they had left. There's about 1 month left; if you fully utilise this time, you will be surprised by how much you can improve.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iwdv9a/o_levels_study_tips_i_wish_i_knew/,True,2020-09-21 05:29:44
218,[Rant] I have nothing left.,"I'm taking my o's this year, and as we all know, we've just finished the first week. I've been really upset the entire week. I didn't do as well as I thought I would for most of my subjects and that scares me a lot. I woke up this morning with hopes that I would study for next week's subjects (Chemistry, Phys, Humans, Amath P2, etc, etc). I walked into my study room and found that it was ABSOLUTELY EMPTY. 

&#x200B;

I am not kidding. Everything I needed to study is GONE and thrown out because my helper decided that she had to clear all of my study material. All the handwritten notes that I spent 18 months working on is gone! All my TYS! All my worksheets! Everything is GONE! I have absolutely nothing and I'm devastated. I don't know what to do. I have to go down to popular later today and buy everything again, but that doesn't help from the fact that all my corrections are gone, all of my past workings, my mistakes, it's all GONE. Not to mention that I have-- HAD-- this one very VERY good book for Geography that is no longer being produced because it's an old copy, is GONE. I can't get it ever again! I'm absolutely shattered. I can't believe I'm going through this. I've lost every last chance I had to brush up on my topics over the weekend. It's all over for me.

Edit 1: Thank you soooo much for the amount of support and help that I've gotten. I honest to god thought that this would get missing or something, but a lot of people reached out and emailed me their notes, and I can't express how incredibly grateful I am to all of you :)

lol i decided to pon my first cs which was supposed to be yesterday, my teacher called my parents and i used my other house phone to hear the conversation between them, my teacher was speaking as if she just fucking shitted herself lmao 

my dad asked why i was involved in cs and she fucking said i voluntarily offered my services, they clearly didn't know that i told my dad about what happened lmao

my dad then exposed her bullshit and yelled at her for like 3mins then she just hang up lmao, and then my form cher didn't come school today HAHAHAHAHHAHA, she prolly shit her pants till she have to spend the whole day cleaning it

since this dumb case thingy my classmates also distanced themselves from our form chers, we used to have chuckles day in and out, we could openly joke but now it's just death glares and stuff, probably gonna be the first fucking school war in the history of singapore

tomorrow is my 2nd cs day and i'm obviously gonna pon again, will update y'all in due time about what bullshit the school gonna come up with now, hopefully another comedy worthy phone call

btw thanks for all the help or support in tryna get back at my teachers, probably will after o lvls but now imma just use their phone calls with my parents as a comedy to laugh at during revision, maybe one day i'll record it and post it somewhere here lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hzyw48/rant_update_on_my_school_tryna_suspend_me_for/,True,2020-07-30 03:14:48

223,[A level] Ranting about 2020 PCME exams,"okay i just need to rant or tell someone because im stressed and scared at the same time. after one week of paper, i just finished h2 maths, h2 chem paper 2 and gp paper. can i just say how horrible i feel? i wanted to cry so much after chem paper 2 and h2 maths paper 1. chem paper 2 what the actual frick was that paper? people around me are finding it easy or at least some answers to write down on their question paper. Me? i left it blank. not because i gave up, it was because i didnt even know what the question was asking for and what topic it was testing. yes it application questions and i should have expected some weird ass questions. but this paper was so different. i feel so frigging demoralised because i studided so much organic chemistry, did so many TYS and i couldnt do half the fucking paper. no joke, i really wanted to end myself. i hate seeing my result slip getting a CCB/D or something liddat.

my family is all fucking smart and it just puts so much pressure. my friends are those smart smart kind and honestly its so frustrating because i felt like i put in effort but i cant produce it on the day of the exam.

and let me just rant about maths paper. i studied for vectors, graphing techniques, graphs and almost nothing came out. I did topical series for PNC because thats the topic i always get wrong. and turns out, it didnt come out. and i had so many fucking mistakes because my mind wasnt working. im just so mad at myself and i dont feel like studying anymore. i feel so damn hopeless and i thought i could actually do well for maths. I'm scared that i fall below a D. I've lost like 30 marks on both papers each and i dont even know what to tell my parents.

this is just so pressurizing. i did so many TYS and its just like seeing my efforts go down to the shithole.

Just needed to rant because i feel so demoralised after today. I dont even feel happy that i'm halfway through a levels.

225,[Uni] All six universities said they have already started sending out offers of places since late last month. The bulk of the offers will go out this month and some early next month.,"So basically an article was published on Straits Times this morning on uni admissions and the situation this year. 

[Straits Times Article](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/unis-take-admissions-online-with-focus-on-aptitude?utm_source=STSmartphone&utm_medium=share&utm_term=2020-05-06+13%3A04%3A04)

Some important paragraphs quoted from article:

♤ A check with the six local universities found that they all had as many applications as last year for the estimated 17,000 university places planned for this year. As in previous years, more than 25,000 Singaporeans have applied, including A-level and polytechnic diploma holders.

♤ The preferred courses of study also remain more or less unchanged.
As in recent years, computing and IT-related courses as well as data analytics are the hottest in terms of demand. The professional degrees, including medicine, law and accounting, continue to be popular as well.

♤ Singapore Management University (SMU) said its business management, accountancy and law degrees all continue to be popular, but noted that its computer science degree is 17 times oversubscribed.

♤ All six universities said they have already started sending out offers of places since late last month. The bulk of the offers will go out this month and some early next month.

226,[Rant] Boomer parents think their know it all,"Ayee just had a convo with ma mum and was talking about getting rejected by eae and she follows up by saying thinking I was in over my head saying I was too arrogant of sorts as you know it is wrong to think you had a shot at entering eae but then didn’t get it. I throw in a casual remark saying hopefully my prelims can help me boost my morales, her instinctive nature is to put me down with the usual “You went to shit school X so your result A or B=C in X better school.” Past conversations lead up to her flexing her girlfriends son saying he is leader of X position, got this result. Another thing I hate is how she loves going off about “READ THE NEWS” And say it’ll improve my writing which is kind of true I guess since we would have more knowledge or know stuff to write about but whenever I ask her to do up an essay for me since she loves to phrase how easy it is by reading the news= amazing compo/essay she goes silent and gives me some death stare.

FFS WOMAN I CAME LOOKING FOR A CHEER UP BECAUSE YOUR MY PARENT BUT I FEEL MORE LET DOWN AND SHIT WHEN SPEAKING TO U THE F***?

228,[Rant] ENOUGH WITH THE CJC HATE PLEASE,"HERE TO CLEAR EVERYTHING UP PLEASE STOP WITH THE BS

Please. Stop it. Whoever you are. 1 person with 3 accounts or 3 people with 3 accounts. The heart of CJ is badly hurt thanks to you, it’s journey and opportunity to improve is going to be horribly ruined. I’m very sure I stand for many students who actually like this school OR just don’t hate it, if you are one of them just put an upvote or comment below, because I believe we need some support here.

We are just here to study and go for our A levels, it’s just two freaking years, leave it be. Obviously I’m not just going to ignore the downsides of CJ, but can you actually open your eyes and see for yourself what is going on? YOU’RE JUST COMPLAINING CRAP AND WHAT ON EARTH ARE YOU DOING OTHER THAN THAT? WHAT SCHOOL IS PERFECT? BAD FACILITIES? WE’RE OLD MAN, GIVE IT A BREAK. THEY ARE ALREADY REPLACING TABLES AND CHAIRS. AIRCON? FIXED. LECTURE HALLS? GOOD ENOUGH ALREADY. HOTEL? TRIVAGO? MY POINT IS THEY’RE TRYING.

I apologise for being aggressive, I’m just very enraged about this entire thing of people coming here just to rant and say how bad the school is, but in reality, it’s a HUGE EXAGGERATION. The teachers here, I ASSURE YOU, are 90% fine. And MOST of them are VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY KIND OKAY. Sometimes I feel like protecting them at all costs but then I’d be the one exaggerating. If you disagree for this, I really don’t know what to say because MOST of the students (THIS YEAR J2s) have been SATISFIED with their teachers, with compliments of them being kind and helpful, so I’m not sure why you aren’t bringing up your matter to the school instead of just COMPLAINING. I’ve seen some of you saying teachers just be there to get paid, like what the actual heck? TELL IT TO THE SCHOOL NO? JUST SIT THERE AND COMPLAIN YA?

Stop talking about staircase 6, even as a joke. We are done with it, okay. It’s a rumour that never occurred, don’t make up stuff just to get attention, AND BRING IT UP TO THE SCHOOL IF YOU’VE ENCOUNTERED IT PLS.

School learning materials ARE FINE. CONCEPTS, THEORIES, EQUATIONS ALL THERE. THERE ARE CHECKLISTS for YOU and your teacher TO CHECK IN ON YOUR PROGRESS. Self-directed learner is a thing, don’t expect teachers to baby you in ANY JC in the first place. Some teachers for Science department might be harder to understand, and sometimes you have to do it yourself.

Yes, Arts is BETTER than Science stream in CJ. Physics has been known to be quite bad here, YES admittance of this from all of us. Other than that, SOME improvements can be made overall, NOT EVERYTHING OBVIOUSLY, NOT EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE PERFECT AND GOOD FOR EVERYONE BECAUSE SOME ALWAYS LIKE TO FIND SOMETHING WRONG AND BE A BABY ABOUT IT.

Why do you care about others social status in the school? Just focus on YOUR studies, and be friends with the RIGHT people, that’s it. Just leave the rest be, it’s their life and consequences. Students not preparing for lessons is THEIR problem. Yes, teachers often REMIND all of them to do their work, but WTF DO YOU WANT THEM TO DO TO HANDLE DIFFICULT STUDENTS?

Which school doesn’t have vapers/smokers? I DON’T EVEN HAVE ONE IN MY CLASS. Although, there are instances which I think it happened. But again, BRING IT UP TO THE SCHOOL IF YOU KNOW WHO IS INVOLVED OR WHAT HAPPENED.

I want to reiterate, TEACHERS HERE ARE FINE OMG. YOUR personal experience could be different, and I don’t see teachers ABANDONING THEIR STUDENTS LIKE THEY DON’T GIVE A SINGLE DAMN. If this is true, BRING. IT. UP. DON’T. JUST. COMPLAIN.

If anyone is wondering, the hostel is to be DEMOLISHED, NOT REVAMPED. It is too old to function; don’t even bother going there and just leave it alone hais.

Apart from academics, there’s CCAs or recreational activities you plan to do here. Generally, we do better in PERFORMING ARTS, BUT IF YOU THINK SPORTS OR CLUBS AND SOCIETIES ARE JUST SLACKING THEN YOU ARE VERY WRONG MY DEAR FRIEND, VERY WRONG. CCAs have done so much in the past years, I don’t think it’s right to say that they just go there and play or slack because it’s not fair to them unless you are saying it on behalf of your OWN CCA.

I don’t know why some people are so INSISTENT and DETERMINED that CJC is not going IMPROVE. You haven’t seen the bigger picture, so don’t assume and think that nothing has been done so far. If you’ve considered the good things, why not mention it too? Good food? (may differ) Good lecture comfort in PAC? Air-conditioned classroom for C block? SUPER CLEAN TOILET FOR SOME REASON??? My point is, don’t speak for everyone and convince others that they’re experience is going to be as bad as yours, some are really exaggerative and not to mention UNTRUE. YES I DO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME BAD STUFF, BUT YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE UP STUFF, SPREAD RUMOURS, OR KEEP THINKING THAT CJ IS GOING DOWN. Yes, I am referring to the declining post.

There are many people out there who support the CJ lifestyle, but many people choose to listen to those who badmouth it. Yes I understand EVERY school has it’s bad points, but you aren’t going to let the school improve if you don’t provide the materials and resources it needs, SO JUST REPORT TO TEACHERS OR YEAR HEADS OR EVEN VICE PRINCIPALS.

Now many of you are now questioning your choice into CJ. If I’m not wrong JAE application ends today, so what is done is done. As for those joining in the future, I want you to not give up on CJ. I want you to be able to stand up for it as it will be a school you go to that affects your future. If you see area for improvements or things that require urgent attention, bring it up to the higher authorities, don’t just sit there and sulk. You are going to be one of the people to change CJ for the better. Please stay hopeful and try your best.

For future batches, I understand your concern for many things, whether you should still be going to CJ from all these mixed subreddits, whether it’s safe to put it as your first choice, or whether CJ is even a good school. I’m here to tell you, it’s your choice, your belief, and finally your future. Decide what you really want, not what others perceive. If you wish to give CJ the hope that can change it, then do it. Don’t let it go to waste and then promote other kinds of demotion to the school.

We are tired of all the misconceptions of CJ which is what actually causes CJ to go down. All the few people who just keep spreading hate are taking over more than the majority who are either fine with it or like it. Another post that mentioned cancel culture was pretty accurate, where one leads to another and suddenly everyone is supporting that idea with no actual motive/reasoning.

As for those who have been saying about their bad experiences. I think you should be bringing up these matters to those of higher positions first before writing all these down. You should be in charge of your studies, not why others shouldn’t go to CJC or why CJC “will” decline when YOU are the one who actually STARTS the decline for CJ. YOU are the one who affects those around you and yourself. Be accountable for what you say, and be responsible for your actions.

tl;dr:

Some people are exaggerating too much on the ""bad"" things of CJ. Some also make crazy stuff up to get attention. What we really want is hope for CJ to improve, so this is a post to stop further ""drama"" and if there are actual issues they should be brought up to teachers or higher authorities.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kxvuae/rant_enough_with_the_cjc_hate_please/,True,2021-01-16 06:42:24
229,[O Levels] Random tips for all,"Do not drink coffee right before exams unless you know you can handle it. If not you could get headache and feel very sick. It will feel like you have the flu, those kinds that you know you need to take MC for. If you really do want to drink coffee before exams although you dont usually do, test it out before papers.  
***if you plan to drink coffee before papers test your tolerance beforehand***

Remember to sleep enough. No point in studying if you end up so drowsy and tired during your papers. If you have an afternoon paper...sure go ahead but remember you do need to be awake and comfotable during your papers.

When you are studying/testing yourself, its good to record your time down. Such as doing practice papers, just take note of how long you took to do it. Remember in exams there is a time limit, whereas studying has none. 

You can study with friends but if they arent helping, i suggest you not. You can hang out with them after exams, no point studying after your papers.

Good luck with any papers/tests/practicals you have
Feel free to add on ;)

231,[NAFA] 8 Tips to not waste your 3 years/money at NAFA (SOAD),"Hi I'm back after the AMA I did decades ago. I just finished my FYP during CB (congrats future grads you won't experience havoc). Haven't officially graduated but I'd like to give some tips to incoming freshmen (or troubled existing folks) who are supposedly worrying before sch starts yet during my time we practically didn't care haha. Students who study at NAFA always have a bad perception of the sch but ever wondered why they end up not doing well and suffer after graduation? I'm here to give tips to help prevent that and as well try to not shit on the sch hahaha

Sauce: studied in diploma in design (Landscape and Architecture). Graduated with a GPA above 3.5, got 1 scholarship and 2  job offers directly after FYP (considered tier 1 companies in my industry). Currently waiting for NUS because I haven't submitted my final results LOL (I might update how it went)

Edit: I GOT IN!

—-

Acronyms:

*SOAD* (School of Art and Design): The department where 3D Design, Fine Arts, Design and Media plus Fashion Studies are ""co-related"". Every student from each department will mix for 1 semester to do foundation study. Being in this department opens flexibility of course transfer

*FYP*: Final Year Project. This will be spammed once you hit year 3

&#x200B;

—-

**1. Do not skim your foundation study (year 1 sem 1)**

Why most people's GPA continues to tumble down is because they lost the motivation at the start. They got horrified after getting their first results. Foundation year is a common study for all SOAD courses and despite it not being the actual semester study of your course until sem 2, one should not forgo the classes. 4 months with randos and this is the time to start doing group work and networking with them. Foundation year consists of basic design theory, introduction to visual arts (art history), drawing fundamentals, creative thinking (free obtainable As) and general studies (the one that sucks ass). Class may seem like pri/sec sch art classes but take them seriously. Students with good art/foundation skills usually survive until the end. Though this was the only semester I scored a bit below 3.5. I like art but do not have that stong art ability and my level of skill is at semi-realistic sketching of humans. If your basic skills are worse than mine, 3 tips to remember:

&#x200B;

* Practice to get the techniques right
* Check especially to get an opinion from your classmates and lecturers
* Redo your work if it's underwhelming

&#x200B;

Do all of this before submission and you will get a score above 3. If you do try hard enough, you may get a 4. Also, don't ever be stingy on art materials at the start, it can make or break your grades/motivation

&#x200B;

—-

**2. Attend all classes**

The rule is simple, it's 3 strikes until deduction without MC. The amount of deduction if you're curious is 1 grade down and can do worse if you continue missing classes. Disappearance is common and so don't try any funny tricks at the lecturers. Even if group work is a pain, don't skip class to sabotage your group. YOU may just end up being the carry of your group. I do not skip any of my classes unless I physically can't do work (does not apply to the lack of sleep) or am unwell. Do attend on time as well because you'll be a headache to whoever is repeating their instructions

&#x200B;

—-

**3. Maintain motivation and proper diet for consistent output**

I can't emphasize this enough. Studying at NAFA can suck your soul till you bleed and all the negative influences in and out of sch can affect your lifestyle/working attitude. It is highly important to prioritise your mental health. I managed to talk someone out of suicide over a breakup. Being socially active is important but you can also be well distracted from work. To be honest, you don't need friends to keep you motivated, you need to tweak your mindset yourself. I stopped my habit of gaming once sch started and I completely forgot how to game once the holidays came. I spent my foundation year doing work with my 1 friend from sec sch who studied Fine Arts. We weren't into socialising so it was beneficial for us muggers. Find someone who wants to succeed and work with them or find that in yourself so that you can motivate others.

Secondly, getting a proper diet at a sch without a canteen is tricky. Food is expensive around NAFA (exception of the sandwich machine). I mostly spent my 1st year eating cup noodles and packed sandwiches + hot milo before realising how lethargic I was despite getting enough sleep. I was also drinking coffee almost a cup daily until it didn't keep me awake. I don't suggest starving yourselves in a bid to save money or weight even. Even if you don't sleep well, keep the other parts of your body functional. Distance to the food stalls may also be a problem when rushing before the next class. There's so much food so what's the best under a $5/10 budget that's nearby sch?

&#x200B;

***$5 budget***

* Hong Sen Curry Rice (SMU) (say you're from SMU for discount HAHAHA)
* Mr Bean (SMU)
* Cheers (Hotel M)
* 7 Eleven (Sunshine Plaza/Ibis hotel) (Mac and cheese is so good + brownies/drinks discount)
* Takashimaya food hall (Orchard) (a bit far but if you have a 1hr30mins+ break then a million buses will get there in 10mins, Japanese food is cheap, never tried the food court)
* Don Don Donki (Sommerset 313)
* Fortune Centre ($2.50 bee hoon is the cheapest)
* Albert Food Centre (Famous Yong tau foo)
* McDonald's (Peace centre/plaza sing)
* That salted egg stall (Sim Lim Square) (Don't remember the name but common for students to eat there, freaking good)

&#x200B;

***In between $5-10***

* Tea Party (SMU) (My fave, $5.20 for pasta with free ice lemon tea
* Subway (SMU/Sim Lim Square)
* Tori-Q (Plaza Sing/Sommerset 313)
* 18 Chefs (Bugis junction/Cathay) (student meal)
* Genki Sushi (Bugis Plus)
* Japanese Curry Express (Fortune Centre) (short opening time, might be full)
* Big fish small fish (Bugis junction)

&#x200B;

There's hot water in the sch so if you want to store cup noodles in the locker for instant meals, feel free to do so

&#x200B;

**4. Don't be stingy on art materials**

You won't want to use watercolour for an acrylic painting. I've spent cash on a box of Copic markers, model materials, camera, a new desktop pc and not to mention bunch stuff I used for a while. I'm not rich but I'd say all of this was for a great investment and it turned out excellent. My parents are always there to support me but I covered about 80% of the stuff I bought. Without the materials to do work, you're doomed. Borrowing something from someone frequently isn't wise because there will be a day when that person can't share. So, unless you're not frugal, buy what you need and not what you want for 3 years and then reward yourself afterwards

&#x200B;

***Tips to save money:***

* Plan for what to buy to prevent overspending
* Buy at Artfriend (student discount). Online shops (Taobao, shoppee etc.) will have cheaper alternatives. Avoid extremely cheap unbranded goods due to quality problems
* Split the product with other people
* Take modelling materials from your studio or workshop
* Buy tools/materials from Malaysia. Mr. DIY has cheap modelling tools and Artfriend exists in JB
* More for Fine Arts students. If you go on OIP to China, art materials are godly cheap. Bring big luggage and buy tons. Can Taobao to hotel/hostel
* Use sch workshop facilities instead of external vendors. Laser cutting (80cents/min) and 3D printing has the best rate

&#x200B;

**5. Try to participate in sch activities even if you're an introvert**

I'm an introvert but guess I can say that NAFA got me out of my comfort zone (even though I'm forever at home). Sch activities (as a whole cohort) at NAFA are rare as they are about 2x annually (Open House + Orientation) and they involve interaction with the public/freshmen. Gone through both and their prep camps and I just want to say how fun it was to mingle with people. The experience is not like your poly camps plus it's practically free + get shirts. Try to keep your score above 2.5 to participate in these events. Other events that are given by your lecturers for your specific course of study should also be taken up. [CCAs are freshly available](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/flkte3/nafalasallenafas_cca_options/fkzokau/?context=3) and points will be given. Not to mention, the overseas trip is once in a lifetime opportunity. It costs about $2k but you can get a subsidy for it. Words can't describe how wild the sch handles overseas trips hahaha. All of these can be written in your graduation catalogue/portfolio. Since there's also not a lot of things to do at NAFA, I strongly suggest doing as much as possible while trying not to destroy your schedule

&#x200B;

—-

**6. Work with the correct people or guide the people who want to be correct**

NAFA isn't the sch where the brightest minds come to study. It's a talent sch. Don't have high expectations for the people here as you may judge your classmates due to most of them being an international student, from ITE or even JC. Don't look at them that way and instead, see their abilities because that is what brought them here. Should you have luck, you'll get to work with the right people. My course has a majority of students with skills that are stuck at the borderline or worse and doing group work is a pain. We often don't get to choose who to work with and this context will be similar in the workforce. My grades dropped a bit (y2s1) due to 1 chaotic mess where I worked with 3 boys (men who couldn't do work) and had 1 guy drop out in the middle due to personal problems. I always carried my group as I was seen as the most capable but I do push my groupmates to work harder and most of the time when the collaboration goes well, it is because they took in the correct advice. DO NOT stir drama and ask your lecturers to swap your groupmates. You will be allowed to give feedback at the end so do tolerate the group work for a moment. Guide these people and do not give up on them, carry the work if there is no choice

&#x200B;

—-

**7. Strive to be a perfectionist**

Talent shows that your idea is good, better if you didn't ask your lecturer to do your work hahaha. Striving to be perfect at your work is pretty crucial especially for future employers/getting awards besides flexing the work towards your classmates and lecturers. Being in SOAD, all of our work requires the production of something which could be a model/presentation board etc for submission. This stuff can be put into your portfolio. [Click here for design portfolio samples](https://issuu.com/search?q=design%20portfolio). Another important thing is if fortunate enough, top tier companies may hire you for internships if your grades + portfolio + interview is good. I'm not sure if the other courses have external examiners but if they examine your FYP and the work is good, they may give a job offer after FYP which was my situation. Of course, to succeed, a lot of sacrifices have to be made and it may be hard to keep your sanity intact

&#x200B;

***Tips to do well:***

* Always ask/Consult for feedback and write them down, even the ones for your classmates as it still can be a relevant reminder for future works
* Make a library of resources for yourself. Pinterest is your best friend. Download all the notes/slides/references from ilearn/Canvas into your pc/drive as they will disappear after the sem. Can be photos/books/PSD/CAD files etc
* Fully master industry software/techniques to not forget and hasten workflow. I self-studied new software to have an upper advantage
* Know how to organise yourself, your things and your time to accomplish work perfectly
* Do not bootlick the lecturers pls

&#x200B;

**8. Enjoy your time at NAFA**

Honestly, [my time at NAFA is a 5/10](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ed54x5/n_levels_nafa/fbgdsp2/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) but it was unique studying at a costly art sch. Some memorable ones: went to China for 3 weeks and drank alcohol almost daily, made friends with another avid photographer to go for shoots, awkwardly dancing with everybody in the public during open house. I don't regret not going to poly because I was passionate about architecture (the sch deadass has none but I learned to like landscape architecture). If I didn't come to NAFA, I would've been studying mechanical engineering at TP with those sad O level grades. The emotional breakdowns, dramas and stuff I encountered are pretty epic tales in my lifetime. I'm proud that I can prove that I have managed to succeed based on my talents instead of academics. I'm very grateful to have been a student of NAFA

So yep, that's it for my 8 tips. I couldn't think of 2 more to add up to 10 lol. Feel free to slide into my DMs if there are any questions",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hd30hj/nafa_8_tips_to_not_waste_your_3_yearsmoney_at/,True,2020-06-21 23:54:00
232,[O level] Just a message to 4E and 5N of 2020 from someone from class of 2019,"So as everyone knows, O level result will be released in next monday 11th Jan. I am sure that some of you will be very worried that you will not get your desired score. Well lemme just share my experience and some observation. 

A few days before my result, I was very nervous I think that I would not get into my desired jc which requires 6 points. To cope with that, I prepared for the worst that could happen based on my feeling of the papers. I came up with a range for my L1R5 that I will probably get and make plan for them accordingly. Well, sure enough, I didn’t get 6 lol. I wasn’t very devastated or shocked because I already prepared for it. Well, I was sad of course because I have been wanting to go to that jc and my senior also rooting for me to enter that jc (my sec school not many people go jc). I got into certain JC with 11 points (quite obvious but yea) and my experience here is great, I made many friends and the teachers are great. So for me, even if I didn’t get there, I am still pretty contented.

Here is story of my friend. She wanted to enter JC, the one that I am in to be exact. She even attempted to DSA into it but unfortunately didn’t get in. The results came out and she didn’t even qualified for JC. She decided to go poly instead. She is doing very well now and got into director’s list or something along that line.

My observation is that on the result day, people gonna be happy or sad, people gonna cry. Some people will be salty because they just miss a grade to get what they want and stuffs. But after almost one year, people moved on and be contented with their life.

You are probably thinking that O level result is your whole life. Well, I used to think it that way too. But what you need to know is that O level levels result is not as important as what you think. No matter what you get, there will a place for you. The most important thing is to have a positive mindset and make the best out of what you have.

With that, all the best for next week!

TL;DR: Do get prepared for the worst case scenario. O level is not that important, what important is to have a positive mindset.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/krolfd/o_level_just_a_message_to_4e_and_5n_of_2020_from/,True,2021-01-07 06:11:49
233,[O Levels] Will my grades be penalised?,"So I was sitting as a private candidate for A Math 4047/01 paper 1 and a fellow candidate had her calculator confiscated because it was unapproved so before the exam I asked the invigilator if I could lend her my spare approved calculator because I always bring 2 approved calculators to the exam and I felt bad, but after the paper I had to write an incident report and I’m scared I get a grade deduction. I mean I know what I did was the right thing to do but I’m still really scared if I get penalised😖",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jgjfmo/o_levels_will_my_grades_be_penalised/,True,2020-10-24 00:50:01
234,[O Levels] Some small advice from a senior(Graduated),"
Disclaimer: This is sorta aimed at students that are scoring badly, but also contains some (non studying) advice for all olevel students from the 3rd paragraph onwards.

Hello, I should introduce myself first. I am a student at a particular institution of higher education(ish). I graduated from Sec 4 last year with a horrible score of 20. So please don't expect any study tips here. I would like to just give abit of advice on what to do from now till the day of the release of your posting to the various institutions of higher education. Personally, even though I did not do well, I don't regret my life in secondary school at all.

Alright, I'll cut to the chase. Firstly, what you have to do now is study, that is priority number one. I'll confidently tell you, the syllabus in secondary school is nothing compared to the syllabus in higher education, especially so in JC/MI. Just put your heart and mind into it, also, believe in yourself. I'm sure you see many many students posting in this subreddit about how a B4 or B3 is horrible while you are getting constant F9s, I was once like that too and got quite dejected, but I still believed in myself, although I was still very lazy up till 2 weeks before the start of the O levels. This kind of laziness is the true culprit to why you score so little everytime(most of the time). There is still time now to work hard to get your desired scores and even get into the courses or schools that you want. However, there is no time to browse insta and tiktok anymore, throw that all away now or else you will regret it in the future.

On a lighter note, if you feel that you have studied enough for the day/week, go out with your friends, play with them, hang out with the people that you want to, you only have a few more Fridays left after school to eat mcds/saizeriya/kbbq with that group that you love before you head off to fulfill your respective dreams. Cherish this time left with them, it's going to be way shorter than you will expect. Got someone that you like? Go up to them and confess your feelings, there's always that chance he/she will say yes, even if you get rejected, you won't be seeing each other after the olevels anymore. Trust me, speaking from personal experience, it's better to get rejected than to wake up at 2.35am one day and start wondering if he/she liked you back and if you missed the golden opportunity with them. (I've never been rejected but neither have I ever confessed, it's a horrible feeling.) Unless of course he/she is in your friend group, then you really have to weigh the costs and the benefits of it carefully. Even if you haven't studied enough and know for sure that you are doomed, why not have the most fun that you can before the absolute shit storm of o levels come around.

After the o levels, go pursue a hobby or find a job, I went for the job option and boy oh boy was it eye opening yet so damn fun. I found a few genuinely interesting and fun people in my workplace who I loved to be around. Not only do you gain friends, you also gain experience, some dolla dolla bills and skills that can come in useful in the future. The if you found someone you like thing in the paragraph above this also applies here if you catch feelings for someone in the workplace. Basically, don't waste this time slacking and gaming all day long, it's really a huge waste of opportunities and time.

The day that you get your o levels, just do what you need to do, pray for your results and whatnot. When you recieve your results, two branches will fork out ahead of you, one is that you got the desired mark and will be heading to your desired course or school, which then you can go celebrate and whatnot. The other branch is that you don't get the desired mark that you want, which then you will have to start to do some soul searching for what you really want. It's a very crucial time for you right now and you really have to use this short period of time to decide on what you want. For this part, you can contact me through reddit dms for any help that you need.

Lastly, before the posting comes out, have fun and hang out with your friends or just do anything you want I guess.

P.S. This is mostly if not entirely based on my personal experience

Good luck for your o levels to whoever read this. Jia you! You can definitely do it! Work hard and you shall reap the benefits in the future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iq47no/o_levels_some_small_advice_from_a_seniorgraduated/,True,2020-09-11 06:21:30
235,[Rant] People are stressing out way to much with all this moderation and bell curve thoughts,"so i've read and read and read soooo many posts about everyone worrying about emaths moderations and oh "" I got 92% can i get an a1"" and all that kinda thing. yes i also feel really worried if i can beat the bell curve and get an a1. yes we all want to get the best score we can get. yes it is concerning when you hear other ppl say how their estimated overall is like 94 95 %. but I feel like we all need to really calm ourself on all this moderation and bell curve related issues. we have done our best and so put in so much of effort in it. as long as you feel like you have done your best. just be happy that you did whatever was in your hand. maybe you could have done better and not made those careless mistakes but if you know you tried your best that's actly more than enough

worrying is obviously bound to happen. wanting to know if whatever you did in the paper will be enough for you to get your desired grades will only be proved to you the day you get your results. I do understand why everyone wants to worry about moderations taking place but I feel like its kinda over consuming us at this point. it seems as though we are panicking more about if our grades will beat the bell curve rather than worrying for like 7 more subjects remaining!! please guys don't spend too much time thinking about moderations and bellcurve right now  just to give yourself little peace or assurance. we CAN DO THIS LATER . 

I found myself also excessively worrying and rushing to see all the tution released answers to see where i went wrong and spent a lot of time crying about it. I realsied that tbh I was in general really satisfied with whatever work I had done in the exam because this was the best work i could produce in my limit. yet that feeling of worrying and panic? crying and sulking? just because i was worried about bellcurve and if i would get my desired grades? nah man not worth crying for and worrying about. channel that enegry to working harder for the other papers !!!

this is not the time to let all these thoughts get the better of us so please stop worrying about moderations and please just give it ur all and let your hardwork and effort prove your marks justice 

this is just my opinion on the excess worry and panic ongoing from what i can see and hear . we need to make sure we do our best that's it. good luck for your papers next week and this.  lets not let ourself be too disheartened from all this discussions about bellcurve and moderations.

236,[rant] i feel like im doing everything wrong:(,"hey thanks for clicking on this post and taking your time to read it:D i just need some help on how to manage my feelings and studies better:((

right now i am in j1 in a mid-high tier jc, and i do not know why but i feel that nth in my life is working out. my sec sch friends do not talk to me as much (except one but she is oso busy) and my fam situation isnt that great either:/ i realise that i have no one to turn to rant and vent my feeling, which is just making me feel so lonely. dont get me wrong, i do have friends in jc here as well but we only talk when we are in school and thats it. i feel that i do not know how to handle my social life, which has been an issue since secondary sch alr, because of trust issues that rose from my experience in a toxic friendship.  i feel that whoever i befriend is just going to leave me because they will find someone better, which makes me feel so insecure. i have no stable grades, family, friends or anything. i do not even feel like living, but am just striving on in the hopes that life will get better at some point. it wont be this bad all the time right? i sure hope so! i never expressed my insecurities to my friends, because im afraid they are gonna push me away if i do. honestly hope to have at least one good friend in jc who i can rely on, but if not, i can continue to rely on myself. i mean i have been an only child and all my life i have grown up alone. thats why i crave people to hang out and have fun with, but maybe i just do not know how:( promos is coming up, and i am just gonna work hard for that. but when i am studying, i end up zoning out and even breaking down sometimes thinking of my inability to be able to foster close friendships. i dont wanna end up alone in life:(( i do make the effort to talk to my classmates and ask then how they are, but it just dies down moments later.

honestly i know my issue alr; the lack of self-love and the excess of insecurities. this is how i have been all my life, but i have no idea how to overcome them:(( sorry if this post is rlly messy, but i really appreciate it that you read all this way! just wanted to vent out how im feeling now thats all:DDD

tldr; an insecure girl who feels lonely and feels incapable of handling her life

237,[Uni] Ever had a lazy-ass groupmate who makes you do his/her work??,"Currently I've 1 groupmate in a 4-person project whos just lazy AF and dosen't care about doing well in the project at all. 

She does what she wants in the group, even though we assigned her the important things to do, needs to be pushed by the rest of us to do her work but only does a half-ass job doing them, regardless of weeks of chasing her to finish her work. As a result, the rest of us need to do the rest of her work to not get screwed over.

Furthermore, she dosen't like people criticizing her ideas and talks in an annoyingly roundabout way that just sometimes gets you riled up inside. 

And because of her ""work"" attitude, we scored lesser than what we could have gotten if she had more initiative and motivated in doing the assignments. But then again, my lecturer somehow knows what she is overall and sometimes calls her out for it. 

The most ridiculous thing about her is that she wants to become a school teacher. LMAF I'd love to see that happening with that half-ass attitude of hers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jyn2k3/uni_ever_had_a_lazyass_groupmate_who_makes_you_do/,True,2020-11-22 17:38:04
238,[rant] I’m sick and tired of trying,"I don’t really want my friends or classmates to know so i guess ill just leave this here. Im taking A levels this year, PCMe. Im sick of tired of trying only for nothing. My grades are always shit and it doesnt help that I didn’t get into this “top tier” JC with my results. I know I probably did this to myself by entering this JC but I’m so sick and tired of always being at the bottom when I have been trying my best. My grades in J1 was mediocre, if not bad but fine? However it all went downhill in J2 where I started getting Ss and Us until Prelims of DEED/C. They say look at improvement but It doesnt help that I have been putting ALOT in fact almost ALL my effort into chemistry only to only get a mere E at prelims. Physics too. I was intially happy until I looked around and saw everyone getting As and Bs. Im still at the bottom 40% for all subjects and to get an A in my school you need to be the top 60%. Its disheartening. I know my teachers are very encouraging and believe I will do well but honestly I just feel like i’m going to disappoint them. The past two weeks of As I came out of the exam hall feeling fine until I read all the reddit threads and found out all my mistakes. I just know that I wont do well.

240,[Uni] To all those who have been rejected by their dream courses,"Please do not compare yourselves with others who have been accepted into your dream course, wondering what went so wrong and what you could have done better. Your score/reference letter/interview merely displays a tiny fragment of your vast aptitude for the course. In fact, these dream courses may not be suitable for those who have been accepted into them. The admission officers are not gods. Either way, there is no perfect course out there tailored to any specific individual, and every course is sure to come with its pros and cons.

I truly hope that you do not blame anyone including yourself for your rejection. There are many factors that you cannot control when it comes to your rejection. Maybe you were just not academically inclined enough during your stressful jc years for the cut-off point put in place by the university (please remember these cut-off points are put in place due to the competitiveness of the course, and is no indication of your aptitude for it). Or maybe the admissions officer didn't find your reference letter particularly inspiring. Perhaps it is time to think if this course is truly right for you, and what are your options to pursue it. If you are sure that you must pursue this course, but your family is not financially able to afford an overseas education, poly/retaking As/appealing is always possible. Your hard work will not be for nought. Yes, it is a longer route. Yes, it may mean taking a gap year and watching your friends move on with uni life without you. But uni is a huge investment and not something any of us want to regret. So let’s all make sure we make the right decision.

The same goes for those who aspire to go to uni and have been rejected by all the unis. It is perfectly normal to mope and be depressed about it, but eventually you will have to move on, and find alternatives.

For people who have been accepted into their dream courses, I feel it is still important to reflect on why you are suitable for the course/uni and what you can get out of it. It is the last step (unless you go to graduate school) before we enter the working world, and it definitely has the biggest influence on what we end up doing in the working world.

For those who are not planning to go to uni, that is perfectly fine as well. At the end of the day, we should remain focused on our goals, and how we go about achieving them, whether that requires uni or not.

I write this with only good intentions. If you feel insulted by anything I have said, I’m sorry and please inform me politely about how I could have said anything better. I acknowledge that I am unable to truly understand what it means to be rejected by my childhood dream course (or even having a childhood dream course for that matter), but I only felt like posting this as I saw way too many of my friends beating themselves up even weeks after being rejected.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gkcwkl/uni_to_all_those_who_have_been_rejected_by_their/,True,2020-05-16 08:58:16

242,[JC] speaking for YIJC,"admit it, when we were in secondary school, most of those intending to go jc did not think YIJC as their first choice. this has sadly caused more than 4/5 of the cohort in YI to be in it without it being its first choice. when the principal asked 1/4 of the cohort (160ppl)  (due to the virus outbreak we were separated into 4 main grps), to raise their hands if YI was their first choice, there were only 20+- students that raised their hands. what about the others? we are left overs. 

one of my friends had put 8 jcs for his/her school selection. none accepted him/her and was randomly put into YI. 

so let me speak up for those here. we are not bad students. i’m sure in every school, there are muggers, there are slackers, there are gangsters, there are last minute do-ers. it’s the same here, it’s not any different from other schools. there are plenty of muggers here too even though we’re more laid back because who doesn’t want a less stressful environment. but even so as muggers(i myself am a mugger), we like the environment here because you can choose to de-stress with the grp of friends that play sports at the parade square/field or stress tgt with the grp of muggers. just like every other school, a lot of people here are friendly. 

ik the school is a lil bit small and most of the classrooms do not have aircons, but tbh, it doesn’t matter because it’s actually not hot in it. 

yijc was not my first choice here. i used to get sad that i wasn’t accepted to my first choice. but when you’re experiencing it yourself already and keeping an open mind, it’s not any different from any schools.

so those taking o levels this year and intent to go to jc, keep your minds open and at least go to our open house next year !",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f6jg4r/jc_speaking_for_yijc/,True,2020-02-20 15:22:53

244,[JC] Inequality of opportunities between JAE and IP students,"Hello! There has been a lot of discussion about whether a social divide exists between IP and JAE students in JC and how this can be overcome. However, I am more interested in the difference in the number and quality of opportunities that these two groups of students have access to. From my personal observations, I have noticed that IP students tend to get access to more opportunities (e.g. leadership positions in their class/ CCA, scholarship/ internship opportunities, pull-out programmes, etc.), regardless of whether students for these opportunities are chosen by teachers or students. This made me curious about the following questions:

1. Is this inequality of opportunity between IP and JAE students present in your school? What are some examples of it?
2. Do you think that it is fair for these differences in opportunities to exist, considering the nature of the IP (e.g. given that IP's purpose is to give students access to more non-academic opportunities, given that IP students have spent 4 more years building rapport with their peers/ gaining the trust of their teachers)?
3. If you think that the inequality in opportunities exists and is unfair, what would you change about the IP to rectify the issue? (Would this be a change at the school level or programme/system level?)

Do let me know which JC you are from if you don't mind as it would be quite interesting to make comparisons between the experiences of students in different JCs :)

245,[A Levels] Some motivation for those about to take A levels soon,"Took A’s in 2019, BCME, RP 88.75;

&#x200B;

i’ll start with my story...

&#x200B;

i joined the students council and was heavily involved in improving student welfare and planning and organising events for the school. this took a toll on my academic performance; i was below cohort average in every subject throughout j1. council activities were the most intense during the j2 jan-april period where it was just eat sleep work all day for the 4 months, and i got so tired to the point that i could only start going back to revision some time in may (as i had mid year exams late may-early july). i thought maybe the june holidays could be a great opportunity to study and catch up on missed work, as well as revise j1 syllabus. and so i did, studying hard for the first 2 weeks of the june holidays.

&#x200B;

then in the third week of june my mother had undergone surgery and i had to take care of her at home as i was the only one who was home all the time, which had significantly reduced the amount of time i had to study for the mid year exams. needless to say, i didn’t manage to fully revise for the exams and still did below average.

&#x200B;

but this time, i knew i had to really push myself hard; it was around mid or late july that i went all out and actively consulted my teachers, practised all my missed assignments, start working on practise papers, i thought “it was my time to shine”. it was at that point in time when i truly realised that a lot of hard work was really needed to produce results; which was what all my peers had been consistently doing over the past 1.5 years, and it was no easy feat.

&#x200B;

prelims came around, i felt like i did much better than all my other tests and exams prior, i felt like i was at my best, and i managed to get an RP of 81, which was now, much better than i had done before, and i performed above cohort average. it was a relief, and an assurance, that my hard work was paying off, and i could actually push myself to do well...

&#x200B;

from there i just kept pushing myself forward, learning and absorbing as much as i could, to learn from my past mistakes, to correct my bad habits and to improve myself in all. over the prelims period i had become closer with many of my friends because of how we were all commonly super stressed about a levels, and we motivated each other by studying together. 

&#x200B;

more time has passed, and the a levels has come around. this time, i felt very prepared for the examinations, aiming to score as close to full marks as possible, and it was really just studying, revising, practising all day long, just to prepare for the examinations.

&#x200B;

but who knew that our first paper, GP, tested us on ZOOS, like WHY WOULD ANY EXAMINER TEST STUDENTS ON ZOOS RIGHT?! that seriously threw me off and i had become very anxious, worried about my GP results because i had forgotten to apply my skills WHEN I GOT THROWN OFF BY THE THEME. this dragged on for days, but luckily for me i had a guardian angel, a dear friend who would always check on me after every paper and would constantly encourage me to do my best in the next paper, which had really helped me to focus on the next task at hand, instead of harping over past mistakes.

then the days continued and i eventually found the sgexam reddit page, and telegram chat group, through which i had discussed answers with other people, to learn to see things from different perspectives, and made me think more clearly. eventually managed to score A's in BCME, and a B in GP :)

&#x200B;

so some things that i had learnt throughout my experience would be:

&#x200B;

1. make friends, support and encourage each other through trying times

2. believe in yourself, have faith that you will put in your best effort, and even if results don't show, you would still have done your best

3. don't give up because of mistakes made, learn from them and improve yourself

4. keep distractions away as much as possible (i used the forest app to reduce my screentime on my phone which worked really well)

5. if you're tired, honestly just go sleep, you wouldn't be able to study efficiently if you're tired. RECHARGE

6. lastly, your mindset is of utmost importance, how you think will frame how you act and that will determine your outcome

&#x200B;

and remember, you still have time to prepare yourself, but if you don't start soon, it will be too late SO STOP PROCRASTINATING",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hesv3w/a_levels_some_motivation_for_those_about_to_take/,True,2020-06-24 18:52:55

247,[A Levels] Confessions and Regrets,"30 October 2020, 3 days before D-Day. About time to share certain aspects I never really told anyone before and certain regrets I have about this short 2 years.

Some people reading this might know me irl especially this one guy in my sch so pls don't expose me ty.

I remember coming in to YIJC for the first time on 1 Feb 2019 just a day after receiving my JAE posting via SMS. Wearing my white and black Secondary Sch uniform and wondering if there's anyone else I know who went to YIJC. Talking to myself that day, I promised myself that I would work hard this 2 years and get a spot in LKC School of Medicine at NTU for AY2022. Man, I wished I kept myself to that promise...

From the very first day in YIJC, I already had doubts of ever going to LKCMedicine. Thought to myself on the first day of school to cut my losses and just take CFMg (Further Maths) and applied to take the selection test. Welp that didn't work, I failed the selection test, but on the bright side, my request to do double science was approved by the school. Best of all, I was also granted H1 Geography although I came from a History Elective background. Maybe LKCMedicine is fated for me? Who knows...

Being introduced to my CG and tutors for the next 2 years, we exchanged our introductions and expectations from coming to JC; we shared the doubts we had about A Levels, our O Level results lol, what H1s we took, what PW is gonna be like, etc. My PW tutor shared with me last year that it was during the first 2 weeks of school that the various tutors feedback to her about me was positive, that they thought I had the capacity to be a top student in YIJC. Delusional my tutors are, I thought...

Things went downhill after the first 2 weeks. Honestly nothing about me changed, I was just how I always was since Primary School; I slept during lectures, constantly didn't do my tutorials, came late for sch almost on a daily basis, always forgot to bring the correct subject notes for the day, etc. Remember I stated earlier that I wanted to go to LKCMedicine? You can see how that went...

CA1 came and I was excited to take my first assessment for the year. Did not thing I would do well anyway, but was just curious as towards how my progress in school was and what is the standard required of me for A Levels. Welp, ABS/D (66.25 RP counting in GP and PW) sure is a weird way to start out my JC life. Yes, I got B for Chem and S for Physics. That's what happens when you go from Combined Science to PCM I guess...

Oh and I'm sure everybody remembers the most hated PW? Like as if one member of my group dropping out of school was not bad enough, my group was literally 3 slackers and 1 leader lmao. I still remember what one of my group mates said in August right before our CA2, ""Guys... so y'all know that 2 of us are doing really badly rn (UUU/U). How bout this, let's hold on our PW progress for now and continue after our CAs."" Sound great right? Do bear in mind that we were literally the second slowest group in the school and have not even finished writing the first draft for Chapter 1 of our WR. Some of y'all reading this post might remember an earlier rant I posted a few days ago where I said something about wanting to get a B for PW and doing the bare minimum. I guess that's one thing I regret about my JC1 life, maybe if I had done more, my other 2 group mates could have gotten an A for their PW as well. If y'all are reading this, I'm sorry for being the burden teammate, I really don't deserve getting an A for PW, not like I could control the marking...

Thankfully, all of us promoted. Somehow managed to get ADE/B (67.5 RP factoring in PW and GP) and got promoted to JC2 lol. Seeing how I got an A for Physics, I thought might as well apply for H3 Physics, since I only have 9AUs because I do not take a MTL subject and I need 10AU to apply for scholarships. Ofc got rejected because D for Chem and E for Maths lol. Looking back, I regretted not studying during JC1. Maybe I might have gotten accepted for H3 Physics if I gotten a B for my Maths and Chem lol. If there was anything from my JC life I could change, it would definitely be this. Now I'm stuck in a bad financial position, not being able to afford for Uni, but also not having enough AUs to apply for damn scholarship. And don't bother about 4H2, I took Combined Science so I don't even qualify to apply for 4H2. I wouldn't be in this position right now if I had just studied in my JC1...

Ofc, JC2 was no better. One might have taught that I would buck up and strive to get a merit scholarship but guess who decided to get CDE/U for the first block exam after coming back to school lol. Covid-19 did not help anything either, with me being out of school for 4 weeks after having flu-like symptoms for over a month. Missing a lot of lessons, and the entire fricking chapters on Vectors, electromagnetic induction, and the first 4 chapters of Organic Chem did not help anything (Got BUU/U for the second block exam lol) What did I do in the 1 month I was out from school? Sleep at home the entire day lol. Did I study? No. Did I try to learn the concepts of topics that I missed? No. Did I bother asking my friends what the homework was? No, didn't even intend to do it lol. Came back to school to everyone surprised that I didn't drop out and almost 2kg of papers in the class pigeon hole waiting for my love and attention that they never got. Those 2kg of papers are currently rotting in my cupboard :(

Prelims came soon and it was the last time for me to pull myself up before the A Levels. One might think maybe I would wake up and actually do something. Well yes, but technically no. Got CDU/S (45RP), but was it because I studied? No. Sorry lah, not my fault that Prelim came out an easy paper... 

Snap back to reality, GP is in 3 days and I finally woke up my idea when study break started. If I really want to go to LKCMedicine in AY2022, I really need to get at least 86.25RP and 45 to 86.25 is a really huge jump lol. I am trying to study but honestly I just have no idea what I'm doing. I have never studied before in my entire life since P1 to JC2 and I have no idea what studying is or what it is about. Feels like I'm paddling against the wrath of a waterfall when all I have is a sampan and a spoon. 

What do I regret about my JC life? If you were not able to catch from the dissertation above, here's a short summary:

\- I regret not studying at all in this 2 years  
\- I regret not waking up after failing my core subjects time and time again even until Prelims  
\- I regret not taking JC seriously, not listening to the advice of my tutors,   
\- I regret not taking up that DSA offer to NYJC (I don't think I discussed this above)  
\- I regret not listening to my friends when they told me to buck up on my work as I was super behind the rest of the class  
\- I regret not being a proper group mate in my PW group which might have been the reason the other 2 did not get their A. It sucks enough when I bear the consequences but it sucks more when other suffer because of me :(

To anyone who plans to go to JC after the calamity of O Levels, I hope nobody turns out like me. Take JC seriously, take PW seriously, don't be a burden to your group mates. You may have been able to make it past Primary School and Secondary School from pure intelligence but I'm telling you right now from personal experience, good luck doing that for A Levels. Even the largest water tanks fully drain eventually. 

And atb to everyone taking their A Levels. JC, MI, Private, we are all in the same boat and I hope that y'all can make it to the course of your dreams. Y'all already have one huge bellcurve tanker over here so dw about it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jkz0ae/a_levels_confessions_and_regrets/,True,2020-10-31 07:35:59
248,[o levels] attitude might be key,"hi! fellow o’s taker here. i know o’s is right around the corner and everyone and their parents are panicking but i just wanted to tell a story so whether you’re procrastinating or taking a break from studying by scrolling thru this subreddit, i hope u take something away from my story :)

during prelims, my very first paper was emath p1 and i was not prepared. i was panicking before the paper trying to revise last minute with classmates but i doubted i could do well. once the paper was distributed, all my worries flew out the window and there was a voice in my head telling me that it was going to be okay, that i would do well. that forced me to calm down and not panic during the paper. i thought i did well, telling my friends after the paper that it was manageable. they (jokingly) called me overconfident but it got to me. fast forward to a few days later for emath p2, i was still underprepared but before the exam the voice didn’t come, most likely because my friends’ words got to me. i was panicking while doing the paper, my head was all over the place so i couldn’t really give my best for paper. it was a waste because after checking p2, it was actually a manageable paper but it was just my nerves that got to me so i couldn’t perform. that happened for both my amath papers as well.

fast forward to results day. i got my emath p1 first, the one i was confident for, and ended up getting a high a1. for p2, i barely got a b4. this shows how ur mindset before and throughout the paper can truly affect your performance. when you’re panicking and you let your nerves get to you, your head will be all over the place and you can’t think straight to be able to well. but if you calm down and tell yourself “it’s okay” you’re more likely to do well even if you’re doubting yourself.

tldr; moral of the story is, your mindset can affect everything. it’s okay to feel that you did well for ur papers. i know many of us dont, bc we’re worried that we can’t meet that expectation but even if you don’t tell other people, it’s fine to think that you did well. just don’t be complacent and if u think u did badly, it’s okay. worry about the next one instead and dont fixate on the past. it’s okay to move on :)

all the best to everyone taking o’s i just wanted to give some reassurance because i know everyone is nervous and anxious. jiayous :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jca9tt/o_levels_attitude_might_be_key/,True,2020-10-17 05:57:56

so i have done notes for all subjects since sec 3, summarised them into mindmaps at early sec 4, and completed all my tys before prelims. 
i got l1r4 6 raw for prelims, and i thought if i were to maintain this, i would be ok.

but now i can’t maintain my rigour.
i didn’t know how i got the spirit for prelims and seem to have lost it right before o-levels.

250,[A Levels] Note to J2s,"Have been a silent reader for quite a while now (even during my own A’s journey) but I can safely say that this subreddit was honestly a whole ‘escape’ & community that I was super grateful for during my J2 year. As cliche as it sounds scrolling through this page and refreshing every day after school just reading everyone’s questions, rants, thoughts & little interactions made me feel that I’m not in this alone, and this is just one of the things I’ve learnt from A levels.

tldr; seeing a few negative posts here and thought I’d pay it forward and offer you some of my personal take from the A Levels journey (hopefully it helps you feel a lil’ better)

Things I’ve learnt from A levels:

*1) You’re not in this alone* 
The A levels journey is not one you have to venture on alone. Yes, going into the exam hall where you can’t bring anyone or even those trusty notes you’ve made in will be daunting, but always remember the times you’ve revised with friends, had consults with teachers, late nights in school studying, Zoom study sessions, random texts in the group chat to seek help for a question or even that post you wrote on this reddit, a comment you left or even being a part of and reading this message now. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Many seniors have walked this path, many seniors are here to help, support and respond to queries you may have, your teachers all are rooting for you deep down and your peers, friends and this entire cohort will be going into this TOGETHER. So if you ever feel alone in this journey please do reach out we’re here as a community and as fellow students we understand that this may not be easy but I hope you find some comfort in knowing that we’re all in this together and you’re not alone on this journey

*2) One step at a time*
It’s a simple mantra that I stood by during revision. Often times, I felt that I was lagging behind, always chapters behind, many gaps in my revision, so lost in classes I couldn’t even finish a practise paper. This made me question ‘Why was I even revising?’ ‘How was I going to practice questions if I can’t even do a single question?’ ‘I don’t even know what I don’t know?’ Sounds familiar yet? Well, once you encounter an unknown concept it’s easy to be trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and you’ll quickly become overwhelmed - these are all normal feelings and everyone would’ve felt it before! (Myself included) One day, feeling all dejected and panicking about A’s on a walk home a friend told me “Just take it one step at a time, if it means doing part A of a test paper then just do that, heck if it means just doing 1 page then just do that, better still if it means doing 1 or 2 questions today then just do that! As long as you’re doing something it’s better than nothing!” In hindsight, that was probably the best advice I’ve gotten for A’s. Whenever I felt overwhelmed with the sheer amount of content I had to go through or even begin to organise I’d tell myself ok today I’ll finish 1 page of this paper, focus on JUST THAT and try to break out of the negative thought cycle loop. REMEMBER: going one step at a time is personal and varies from person to person as long as you did something, it’s an improvement from where you were before doing that - so give yourself that small win and just continue taking small steps every day!

*3) Negative thoughts are OK*
Negative emotions and thoughts are all part and parcel of being human. We all have good days and bad days, there will be periods we feel down, sad, dejected, hopeless, lose faith in ourselves but all these are necessary for you to understand what happiness, hope, relief, calmness and faith even feel like. Sometimes we find ourselves at rock bottom, then falling even lower (like whatt hasn’t the world already thrown enough at me?!) but this too is part and parcel of growth. I used to constantly crave happiness and a stress free life, but I believe as you mature and have a look at real life, you’d begin to understand that the negatives are just as important in this pursuit for happiness, acknowledging that these negative emotions are necessary and NORMAL is important. Don’t beat yourself up over feeling sad because you can’t understand an easy concept, don’t tell yourself you shouldn’t feel stressed out, don’t tell yourself you can’t be dejected - these are all part of the journey, accept these emotions, feel them, and acknowledge them as part of your personal growth journey. Months later you’ll look back and realise ah yes THAT made me a stronger person today. A’s definitely till this day remains one of the lowest points in my life, I dreaded walking into school everyday, endlessly wished it all be gone and admittedly before this post have completely buried this part in a deep corner of my memory hoping to not relive it. BUT, time and time again I always find myself comparing my workload and stresses back to the days where I was sitting in your position and I tell myself ‘I’ve been through the rigour of A’s this is really nothing compared to those days’ These negative emotions you feel today are part and parcel of your growth, so embrace it, own it and chart the way forward! Recall 1)You’re not in this alone & 2)Take things one step at a time

*4) Every day is a fresh start*
Treat every day like a mini reset button. Get a good nights rest every night, wake up fresh and conquer the day on a clean slate. If you previously had a terrible study session, leave it behind. TODAY is a new day and it’s a new start for you, a clean slate for you to begin whatever you have planned for yourself. In the midst of all the rigour, intensity and stress that fuels this journey always always remember to take care of your health! Find a way to unwind and click that reset button so you can begin the next day FRESH. If you’re an early bird, set a schedule so you sleep early and wake up early to maximise your productive hours. If you’re a night owl, set a schedule so you can study into the night and still get enough rest to reset for the next day again. It’s personal, everyone has their own optimal methods and you know yourself best! Personally, I’m not a great runner but I picked up running during the intensive study period right before A’s where we didn’t have to go to school. Every morning (give or take the days days I need that extra snooze), I’d wake up go for a quick run (15min, 20min whatever suits you) and come back to start my revision - could be the endorphins but it personally helped me feel better about the day and start it on a nicer note (OH yea, nikerunclub has some awesome guided runs that really picked me up during this period too - if this might work for you then check it out!) Regardless, find a hobby, find an avenue for yourself to unwind at the end of the day or between revisions, give yourself that break and NEVER feel guilty for taking a break. Make your health and well-being a priority. 

*5) This too shall pass*
Like many things in life, A’s will be another milestone you pass in life. As someone who has been in your shoes, I can confidently tell you that a few months down the road, no matter the results, completing the last paper will usher in a sense of well-deserved satisfaction. You’ve made it through this journey, no matter the outcome, the strength and tenacity will train you up for far greater feats in life. During my A’s I picked up running (which I mentioned previously), I’ve grown as a student and more importantly as a person. I think it has allowed me to mature and regardless how you do - it’s not the end of the world. I’ve had peers who did really well, others who didn’t fare as well as they expected, some who even transferred to poly because A’s wasn’t the route for them but a few years later when you look at where we all are now, A’s was really just another step in this long journey of life, each of us have found our own successes and are still continuing the journey to adulthood. Maybe some of us might not end up taking a conventional route but who knows THAT may just be the opportunity for you to reevaluate your goals and find something you may end up enjoying even more. In the grand scheme of things, adding a few more years to take a detour ain’t gonna matter, we still have many years ahead of us and there’s so much more to say about the life after A’s but I’ll keep it brief for now - this too shall pass!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i9cu1q/a_levels_note_to_j2s/,True,2020-08-14 17:34:26

252,[JC] The 4 step study strategy to use for CB,"I will share with you how to approach this self study period during circuit breaker. 

I am a tutor who taught for 4 years (4 batches of students). I know from experience that students actually have study strategies that are not helpful. 
This is me giving back to the community and giving you a tool to help your studies in this period. 

I can tell you the common strategy most students employ:
1. Start study session
2. Meet hard/ difficult question
3. Sigh
4. Open social media/ youtube
5. Binge 
6. Feel bad abt wasting time 
7. Go back to step 1
8. Repeat until day is over

May sound funny, but many are susceptible to this. Most likely, they told themselves to be productive, but when they can't even solve a question, their morale tanks. The mind wants to ditch it and find something easier and less painful (entertainment becomes an option). Then guilt and self loath kicks in. This is not helpful. 


What to use instead? 
This is my 4 simple step study strategy that helps my students be productive not just for a short burst, but over the whole year, to gain a competitive advantage.

[Step 1] Plan your study session 
- choose subject, choose a topic
- pick 3 questions that you will do (not 10!)
- prepare your sch/ own notes at the side of your desk relevant to the topic 
- put phone and electronic devices away/ airplane mode. 
- mentally prepare for a 30min-1h session, but no longer.
- prepare a 15min break activity of your choice (5min if you are disciplined) to do AFTER you've completed. 

[Step 2] Execute
- you may refer to the notes, but depend less on it as you progress
- you dont want distraction, you may let your family know that you wish to be uninterrupted this session 

[Step 3] Enjoy your well deserved break. Give yourself a pat on the shoulder 
- this is not to be abused. Set an alarm for 15min when you start your reward, do not exceed the time. 

[Step 4] Repeat 


The point of this strategy is to do work that feels manageable. Your mind would be open to walking up a hill but shut off to climbing Mount Everest. So you must set an achievable objective for the study session. It also cannot be too long, otherwise, your mind will let time drag on. Finally, this must be sustainable. That means you give yourself something to look forward to at the end of each session. 

If you know the pomodoro technique, then this would sound familiar. However, the emphasis is on what you DO, rather than just a 30min-5min guideline. (Because honestly, you could stare at a question for 30min and say you're abiding by the rule, which doesn't help.) 

Note: you may form an accountability group with your friends, or better, let your parents keep you in check for this strategy. Also, after you get comfortable with this system, you may increase the session to more questions at a time. Up to your discretion. But never shorter.

There you have it, 4 simple steps. Should you implement it well, you stand to gain good profit. I hope this helps you. 

P.S. If you have a strategy of your own, I welcome you to share as well (comment/dm). Stay safe and study hard everyone",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g1hvtn/jc_the_4_step_study_strategy_to_use_for_cb/,True,2020-04-15 16:57:23
253,[O LEVEL] To all those not taking Amath papers,"Hello people, as said in the title, yes I am one of those not intending to do the Amath papers. And to all those also not intending to do their amath papers today and next mon for whatever reasons. You're not weak. You're not a failure. You're not a disappointment.
Maybe it's just me, but whoever that needs to hear it here. I failed amath for 2 years now. And to be very honest, I only have all my six subjects to count on. If anything, not focusing on am gave me quite a bit of time to focus on my other subs.
I think I gave myself enough chances to improve my am but however I try. I just completely lost my motivation and focus on it. So I left it behind now.
So whoever that's not taking the Amath papers, spent time on your other subs.

256,[RANT] pressure to spend during group outings,"so exams just finished for my school and rn everyone is going out to celebrate and stuff. We have this break for around 5 days (depending on ur exam schedule) and of course I just want to make use of this time to catch up with friends. the problem with that is money, at least for me. most of my friends are well off and they have no trouble spending $100 a week or more, but my allowance on the other hand is around $30 a week, plus I’m a more thrifty person which makes matters worse. my Budget is enough for some simple meals and maybe a movie or two, but these friends want to eat at high end restaurants like haidilao and go on shopping trips where they spend lavishly. spending 100+ on trendy clothing and food a trip might not seem like much, but i find that it’s quite a large sum for me...

this happens quite often, nearly every time I go out with them, and it puts a lot of pressure on me to spend as much as they do. when I choose not to spend while shopping with them, they would start pushing me away. they completely don’t engage with me and would pretend im not even there, since I don’t intend to buy anything. So basically I’d spend 3+ hours watching them shop while being ignored. that’s just the shopping part. as for the food, every time I suggest we shouldn’t eat at such high end places, they’d make fun of me, so sometimes I just suck it up since paiseh plus i don’t want them getting mad at me (it happens). then every time they decide that the amount they spent on food was lower than expected, they’d order more since they have ‘more to spare anyways’.

my friends are great and all but when it comes to hanging out with them it can be quite a burden. sometimes it makes me even more upset than fulfilled. honestly, I don’t know what to do about this.

i don’t think telling them about what I think is going to help because all they’re going to do is choose not to include me in outings cuz of the limitations of my spendings. plus not hanging out with them is...kind of not feasible since emphasis on a social life is quite big. sigh what should I dooooo :(

Edit: thank you all so much for all the suggestions and advice, i appreciate it a lot! some of the comments were really eye openers for me. it’s true that these relationships aren’t very healthy. ill try talking to them about the situation first. If it doesn’t work out, then i guess ill just distance myself from these friends, and maybe try to find new ones. thanks guys, super grateful for all of your inputs :”) .. also to all those with Os or whatever exams coming up, atb!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jarvlg/rant_pressure_to_spend_during_group_outings/,True,2020-10-14 18:18:00
257,[RANT]How do you deal with a obsessive parent in your school life,"“Ask your teacher which is the most popular medical university “

“Ask what is the minimum gpa to get to med school” 

“I want you to become a doctor when you get out of uni” 

“Doctor is the only way to survive in this world” 

Honestly, sick and fu*king tired of hearing this nonsense from their mouths , call me an ungrateful son or whatever that makes you sleep at night . I just started polytechnic a month ago and they are already discussing about freaking university, I haven’t even gone into a specialized track in my course yet (biomedical science, yes, was basically forced to go there , but I like science so my interest align ) . Had plenty of arguments saying why doctor may not be the best profession but they immediately shrug it off by saying 
“you are still young , when u grow up u will regret, listen to me “ 

They are too obsessive, constantly reminding me to be a fu*king doctor , sure I don’t hate doctors . I respect them if anything, 10 years of studying is no small feet and in this pandemic they are most important . But my parents somehow see this as a money making opportunity . These times only enforce their belief that doctors won’t be unemployed and make lots of money .

258,[A levels] Guide to taking the A levels as a private candidate,"Hi guys,

After my previous post, I have received an influx of DMs pertaining to taking the A levels as a private candidate. While I am happy to answer every question, I realise that many people who have questions may not actually bring them up. Additionally, there really isn't a thorough guide online that is easy to find. So to spare potential private candidates from the pain of trawling through pages of HWZ/EDMW or trying to sift out information from multiple old reddit posts I've compiled this guide.

*Disclaimer: I am writing this mainly for potential private candidates who did not attend JC before. This can also apply to A level retakers, but my perspective is focused more on people with no experience with the As.*

**Introduction**

Before I begin, let me introduce a bit of background about myself to establish some credibility in what I say. I was a poly grad with a terrible GPA, I took A levels privately in NS and managed to score BBB/DA or 77.5 Rp if rebased. I managed to get offers from NUS, NTU and as of now an interview from SMU.

**Mentality and Circumstance**

Prior to making a decision on taking the A levels, there are several things you need to ask yourself first. It may be a no-brainer for some to consider these things but I've seen people not consider any of these questions.

* What are my goals? what do I want to achieve out of taking the A levels?

What career are you heading towards? Is it actually necessary to take the A levels to get there? The A levels are extremely difficult with no guarantee of success, so the reason you choose to take the As has to be reasonably strong as it will form the basis of your motivation. Moreover, if it is not necessary to take the A levels to achieve your goals, then please consider alternate paths.

* Am I prepared to be dedicated to studying for the A levels?

Seems obvious, but you must be able to muster the prolonged discipline necessary for the As. A proper mentality is very important, if you aren't ready to undertake something seriously, I wouldn't recommend taking the A levels. I have seen people just drop out halfway so being able to stay committed to your goal is something to mentally prep for.

* Do I have enough time to study for the A levels?

This applies mainly to guys with NS, from my experience it will take at least 2 years to be properly prepared to sit for the exam. This is especially so if you have not studied in a JC before. Taking it within a single year is really not feasible. So depending on your situation, are you able to spare 2 years of your time to get ready for your A levels?

* Is my situation favourable for me to study for the A levels?

Again applies mainly to guys. If you are looking to take your A levels during NS, you need to consider your vocation and PES. Are you a combat fit soldier? Do you stay in or stay out? Are you a clerk or a commando? These questions need to be answered. So if you're a pre-enlistee, until you have answers to these questions, please refrain from committing to doing the As. Similarly for girls, do you have a work commitment? can that be pushed aside?

***Important poin*****t:** If you are a Y1 Y2 poly student who is thinking of taking private As as your GPA isn't that great, please don't do it. You still have time, calculate if you can pull your GPA up before graduation to enter uni or try transferring to a JC to do your As. The best place you can study and take the As in is a JC. Don't worry about being a year or two older than your peers, it really does not matter. In the long run, small age gaps aren’t significant but having a proper degree is.

* Can my current results get me anywhere first?

This is for JC/Poly graduates with mediocre results. You might be thinking of retaking due to getting 65-70RP but please do check the entry requirements for all unis and actually try applying first. If you can get into somewhere preferable with your current score, taking the As might actually be unnecessary.

**Basic Info about the A levels**

This may be painfully obvious for ex-A level students but not everyone is actually aware of certain necessary things like valid subject combis or killer combis. I was lucky enough to have many JC friends advising me on what subjects to take.

* Basic subject combis

In order to apply for uni admission with an A levels cert, you need to take a minimum of 3 H2s + 1 H1 + H1 GP + MT.

Please keep in mind that your subject combis *need* to have a contrasting subject. What this means is for your 3 H2s + 1 H1 one of your subjects has to be contrasting from the rest. Meaning if your 3 H2s are science-based your H1 is arts-based, vice versa. You can also have a contrasting H2 subject but normally people contrast their H1s.  (i.e. if my combi is H2 Econs, History and Literature my H1 should be Chemistry, Maths or Physics)

It is a *must* to take H1 MT, you only can get exempted under special dispensation from MOE or you passed HMTL in Os. Keep in mind you cannot apply for MT Basic level if you score B4 and above for O level MT.

* Valid grouping of subjects per exam sitting

In order to apply to uni you need to take your 3 H2s in the same sitting with H1 GP. H1 MT and other H1 subjects can be taken in a separate sitting.

* Things to consider before deciding on a subject combi

Here are some important pointers to consider when choosing which subjects to take.

1. Knowing your goals

If you have already decided on the course to apply for at university, then you should look at the A-Level subject requirements from the various universities. For example, certain courses might require a pass in H2 Math or H2 Bio.

2. Know the track record for the subjects

Even if you are very keen on taking a subject up, please keep in mind the distinction rates for the subject. After all, grades are the main thing that gets you into university. For example, you might really want to take Theatre studies and Drama as an H2 subject but after checking, its national distinction rates are at 5%. This may be a cause for concern and you may want to rethink taking that subject.

3.  Know the difficulty and academic load

Certain subjects should not be taken together despite them being valid combinations. Subjects like H2 Geog and History put together is just plain suicide. Ask around, check with people who have taken your desired subjects before and find out more. Also, know the academic load of each subject, H1 Math is around half the content of H2 math while H1 Econs is around 70%  of H2 Econs. Picking your subjects strategically is half the battle won. Additionally, if you are struggling at a particular subject for your O levels, then it would be unwise to choose it at the A-Levels as the increment in content and skills required to do well can be very large (even if you are interested in the subject).

4.  Keep in mind your circumstance

This applies mainly to science subjects. For science subjects do you have access to lab equipment to practise practicals? if not maybe they are off the table.

5.  Know your strengths and interests

This may seem cliche, but it is important to choose subjects you are interested in and actually are strong in. Since you are going to spend the next two years studying a subject, you might as well enjoy learning what you are interested in.

6. Know the level of obscurity of the subject

If you want to take an obscure A level subject keep in mind it is going to be very difficult to find both materials to study and tutors to guide you. Singapore has an abundance of material and tutors for subjects like Math, Econs, GP, Chem, Physics. But if you want to take ELL, Literature, Computing, China studies or POA, it might be hard to find good materials. Good tutors available for these subjects may be harder to find as compared to more popular subjects.

* Rank Point Calculation; From H2s and H1s to /90

For RP calculation each H2 is worth a certain amount of points while each H1 is worth half that amount of points.

An A for an H2 is worth 20 points while an A in H1 is worth 10 points. Each decreasing grade for an H2 is 2.5 points (i.e if an A for H2 is 20 points a B would score you 17.5 points) while each decreasing grade for H1 is 1.25 points (i.e. an A for H1 would be 10 points a B would be 8.75 points)

[Rank point Table extracted from Zueet.com](https://preview.redd.it/1diynhq62ay41.jpg?width=816&amp;amp;format=pjpg&amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;s=cc20a15b463c50eb4cbcd21a7a59b80515272f34)

*Note: check out*  [*http://zueet.com/tools/a-level-university-ranking-points-calculator/*](http://zueet.com/tools/a-level-university-ranking-points-calculator/) *for a handy rank point calculator!*

All the points are added up excluding MT first. That will bring you to a total of /80 for private candidates and /90 for JC students cos of PW.

Priv candidates: 3H2(20x3) + 1H1 (10) + H1 GP(10)

JC students: 3H2(20x3) + 1H1 (10) + H1 GP(10)  + PW(10)

Then the MT grade is added in and rebased back to 90. The better of the two (with or without MT) would be taken to be your final rank point.

* The famous ""I don't have Project Work (PW) as a private candidate"" question

Normally, JC candidates will have their Rp calculated /90 with PW contributing 10 points. So as non-JC private candidates the maximum we can score is /80 as PW is not available to non-JC students. The main question, however, is will we be disadvantaged as compared to our JC peers? The short answer is no.

I corresponded with NUS, NTU and SMU through email on this, they seemed deliberately vague with their answers on how they calculate RP for private candidates but the main message is clear: private candidates with no opportunity to offer PW before will not be disadvantaged.

The way I rebased roughly was to take my score ((68.75/80)x90) = 77.5 Rp. This rebased score seemed to fit into the way my uni applications were handled by NUS NTU.

For NTU I was invited for an admission interview and test in early April, before people scoring 73 RP or 70 RP received the same invitation. This means my RP probably had to be higher than them.

For NUS I managed to get an ABA. According to many posts here on the subreddit, people who received ABA had RPs ranging from 77-80.

Overall if my score was not rebased and I only had 68+ RP, I wouldn't have been able to get admission to NUS NTU or even get an interview with SMU. So don't worry, you won't be disadvantaged.

**Supplementary Material and Study Habits**

I think everyone has different studying habits and styles, but I'll share roughly how I studied and what sort of guidance I sought. I'll break down my studying process into steps then talk about guidance later.

Step 1: Content mastery

This is very important, regardless of whatever subject you are taking the first step is being able to understand and remember the necessary content very well. I don't know how other people would do it, but personally, I copied out 6 booklets worth of Hwa Chong Econs notes to lay the foundation of my Econs content knowledge. It may be different for others but please find out how you remember things best and use that.

Step 2: Answering techniques

Please realise that there are esoteric ways Cambridge wants you to answer in. Not just any format, any structure or any sort of phrasing is the right way. There are keywords, ways of answering that are important to know. It would be best to get a tutor who is experienced to teach you these things.  But please learn these things well.

Step 3: Application under timed conditions and reinforcement

With content and answering techniques down, I moved on to applying them together under timed conditions. This means trying to give my best quality answers within the time constraints of an exam. This done many times would also help to reinforce content.

On how much I studied per day, I think that is unimportant. Quality of study beats quantity hands down. This, of course, doesn't mean you should just study an hour per day, productivity should be based on progress not time spent.

* Supplementary material and guidance

It is vital to have someone guide you, especially if you have not been to JC before. I started on most of my tuition only 7-8 months before my As which is something I regret. I feel that if I started earlier I would have been able to do better.

Material wise, I would divide it into 3 tiers.

Primary tier - I really recommend scouring carousell for notes/model essays from ex-JC students who scored As for their subjects. These notes are the most targetted and the most effective. If possible getting notes from the subject department of individual JCs would also be highly recommended as it is the closest you can get to an actual JC preparation.

Secondary tier - Notes from tuition teachers. Unless your tuition teacher is an ex-JC teacher or some ex Straight A JC student, what they give may not be as effective as they aren't exactly in the ""MOE system"" and thus would not know exactly what to spot.

Tertiary tier - notes and materials from Popular can be useful but most of the time at a JC level, the stuff you get there isn't actually that great. It's generic and sometimes just bad. 2 of my tuition teachers who were ex-JC teachers actually commented on the answer scheme of some popular books I bought to be ""inadequate"" and ""too superficial"".

**Logistical guide and Experience**

How about the actual process and experience of registering and taking the A levels as a private candidate?

* Registration

you need to register with SEAB as a private candidate. Go to their website and navigate to the A level's section. alternatively, click this link [https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/online-registration-for-private-candidates](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/online-registration-for-private-candidates) (I have no idea if this link will be valid months or years from now so if it doesn't work just search SEAB's website)

Remember that there is a deadline for the registration, it generally ends in March with the exception of this year (2020) where it extended until May. You can withdraw your application and get a refund several months on IIRC so don't worry too much if you managed to get a uni placing after you registered.

* Location

If you registered for MT examinations, more likely than not you will be sent to SEAB's Tiong Bahru examination centre. For the rest of your papers, you will be assigned to a JC depending on where you live.

* Logistics

Attire wise, dress appropriately. There is a guide on what to wear to the exams but generally, keep to long pants/jeans, covered shoes etc. For girls try not to wear a dress, it's going to be cold in the exam hall anyway. T-shirts are fine, there is no need to wear a collared shirt in.

Standard exam logistics also apply, remember to bring a jacket, water bottle, stationery etc. Most importantly: Bring your entry proof and identification documents (IC, 11B or passport)

A special note for students taking H1 or H2 Math. Please check that that your graphing calculators have been approved by SEAB. (check out this link:  [https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/approved-calculators](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/approved-calculators)) Additionally, remember to check that the software for the GC is also approved.

* Experience

It's going to be tough taking the A levels as a private candidate in a JC. The feelings of isolation will be amplified. I remember taking H2 Literature in a classroom and I was the only private candidate in the entire room. Everyone else was sharing tips or talking about how they were feeling. I was then singled out by the teacher to stand in front of the class because my private candidate registration number was not on her list, that was quite an experience. So I do understand how it feels to be alone in such a situation and I want to mentally prep anyone for such a scenario so they would not be too affected by it to be unable to fully focus on the paper.

Also, there should be a noticeboard near the entrance of the JC. This will indicate the location you will be taking the exam within the school and your seat number. Please check this out early instead of rushing to find it 5-10 minutes before the start of the exam.

**Cost**

This is the part most people don't like talking about. But it is important to let everyone know how much it costs to take the A levels privately.

You need to take into consideration how much would tuition + materials + registration would cost overall. Can you afford constant tuition? How will you finance the costs?

Of course, the cost varies depending on how much tuition you take and how expensive the tuition is. But generally, constant tuition is very expensive. I went for my econs tuition every week for 2 years while I went for the others sparingly, focusing in about 6-8 months before the As. The total cost after 2 years was about 15-17k, I forked out about 7k while my parents covered the rest.

IIRC, the market price for ex JC teachers from top tier JCs like HCI, VJC, RI goes for 120-150 (some even 200 if u hire them very near the As) an hour for 1-1 tuition. The average price for ex A scoring JC students is 40-60 an hour and non MOE teachers are 60-100 an hour. (Depending on group tuition or 1-1 tuition)

The monetary cost of taking the As privately needs to be factored in alongside the cost of time, effort and risk.

**Conclusion**

I hope the information presented here is helpful for anyone interested in taking the A levels as a private candidate, I would be happy to answer any further questions by comments or DMs. If there are any suggestions to add more info, do let me know!

Edit: based on feedback about tutors in comments. To read original look at quoted line in comments.

259,[rant] hbl makes me want to die,"- my niece sleeps in my bedroom so I can’t studying in my room ( I’ll disturb her when calling ) 
- my family plays mahjong almost everyday and it pisses me off. How am I supposed to focus on studying when all I hear is people arguing and laughing. 
How is everyone coping with hbl? It makes me want to die every second and I was I just have a bedroom to myself. Oh another thing, the baby cries every goddamn time so I need to pick her up and carry her ass. I pity my mom for having to wash clothes by hand and my mom is already suffering back pain. My brother wakes up late so he is not going to take care of the baby. And whose baby is that? My sister’s. I don’t even know why the hell is the kid here. She said my mom doesn’t mind taking care of the kid but uh hello? I mind. I have to waking up in the middle of the night to feed the kid and it pisses me off.

261,[O Levels] Things I dislike in my school,"Hello, this is just a mini part of my thought process during school time. I am a Secondary 4 student who is currently trying to get good results for O's. But there are just some things that schools do that just contradicts what they're aiming to achieve.

First of all, attire rules. Sure, it is important to allow students to manage self responsibility and discipline by ensuring that they wear the appropriate uniform or attire on some school days, and it also creates a sense of belonging and uniformity, as well as identity as it makes the student feel a part of the school. But there was once where my classmate wore a shirt during dress-down day (where we can wear camp or school based shirts) and apparently the shirt wasn't acceptable even for dress-down attire rules. So what was her punishment? Class-time detention, where she is not allowed to attend lessons but sit in the detention area just daydreaming, not even allowed to do homework. Isn't that a little counter-productive? We are literally graduating seniors who are cramming for O'levels and especially due to the previous quarantine period, lesson time will be even more precious and important to us, so why should she be kicked out of class during lesson time just for wearing the wrong shirt? It's so unnecessary in my opinion.

Secondly, I don't understand the need to get students all lined up and orderly for just a short assembly period. Recently, we had to stay back for a short exam briefing, but instead of getting straight into the briefing when we arrived there after our exams, they instead fussed over our seating arrangement and complained that even though we are sec 4's, we ""still have no idea how to properly arrange ourselves"". What's the need honestly? If we are all settled down and quiet, you can start the briefing, after all, all we're staying back for is to listen to the briefing and go home to study or catch a break. Just hassling over our seating orders is so time wasting and it creates avoidable frustration for both teachers and students. The briefing would have taken around 10 minutes if not for the hassle, and it ended up taking 25 to 30 minutes.

Additionally, some teachers love to target the shy students during classes, then refuse to continue to teach until they speak up. I understand if this is for oral practice and the teacher is annoyed because the student is too shy to speak and it might result in a fall in their grades, since oral does account for a decent percentage of the overall grade. But if it's after orals, and they are still doing this, I simply just don't understand. Move on and let another student speak, just egging the student to get a response out of them might cause them unwarranted anxiety and stress, especially if they are going to get reprimanded if they get the answer wrong.

 This brings me to another point, why do some teachers also like to claim that they are comfortable with answering all questions as they want their students to understand the topic further, but when they do get asked a question, they start scolding the class for not knowing ""such a simple thing""? This is what puts off the class from asking any question that bothers them, as what most of us fear most is getting scolded and humiliated in front of the class, it is not a nice feeling. I understand that it stresses the teachers out that students still need to clarify on such easy topics despite their O'level exams arriving, but once we get yelled at for asking a question, we would get anxious the next time and not speak up at all afterwards, which leads to the question or misconception snowballing and snowballing until we mess up during our O's. If you don't think such teachers exist, I have this type of teacher in my school, which is terrible because they are such a wonderful teacher, they are strict because  they really do care a lot for us, however this kind of attitude towards students asking questions is so off-putting to us and it really limits our learning during lesson time. 

Lastly, what is it with certain teachers that like to label students and announce individual test results with the main purpose of pointing out their mistakes in front of the whole class? Again, I have this type of teacher in my school, and they, too, care a lot for our class and they are very sweet but seriously, labelling students who cannot get an A or a B as ""weak students"" is so discouraging. I've worked my ass off for an A2 in this subject and I was absolutely delighted when I got back my results yet I was still labelled as a weak student just because I had bad grades in that subject in the past. The teacher did credit me for my improvement, but it was as though they also didn't think I was good enough yet, because they still kept targeting me with easy questions and thinking I still have no idea how to solve those questions yet. I am not the only target, many other classmates were also targeted despite their drastic improvements in their grades, due to their previous streak of bad grades as well. It is so disheartening to think that in the eyes of that teacher, you are still not good enough despite your hardwork to get a good grade. They also go to the extent of announcing your test scores then proceed to tell the class if you have deproved or improved from the past tests. That should be confidential to the student only, there is no reason to put them down in front of the whole class. It's good to acknowledge those who have improved, but for those who struggled a little during the test and ended up scoring lower than usual, it is very unmotivating to hear your name called out for biggest drop in grades. I like the teacher a lot, just not when they do this. I learn a lot from them and their in-depth analogy on questions but I just wish they would be more sensitive to our wellbeing.

All in all, I do not hate the education system, neither do I hate my school. I love all my teachers a lot, because without them I would be the person I am now. I appreciate the privilege of attending school and receiving proper education unlike the less privileged people in the world, and I do not regret coming to my school. But I have to admit, there are still many areas of improvement the education system should work on that would further benefit both the students and the staff of the school, because although the system has produced many successful and intelligent students, it does not mean it is perfect for everyone yet.

262,[Rant] Dreamt about failing A levels??,"Man the night before a bio paper my brain decided to make up and play me an entire movie of what it might be like on results day jeez. 

I remember getting my results in a classroom and when I walked into the classroom with my friends this teacher whom I don’t know pointed at my friend and said “you did very well” and the rest of our hearts just sank.

Fast forward to half an hour later, I remember the teacher calling us one by one to get our a level certs. When it was my turn, she decided to glance at my grades first then look at me like I’m some piece of trash and I was like “oh no”.

So I went back to my seat and remember seeing ‘BS/D’ very clearly on my cert. because Us are not included on the cert so it meant that I got UUBS/D?!?!?! Which was quite sad and everyone else was getting like 85+RP and asking me how much I got so I just decided to go up to the rooftop and cry🤡

Yeah and when I woke up I didn’t even realize I was dreaming? I just readily accepted it like “oh yes a levels is over I failed so now I gotta think of how to retake” until I heard my alarm then I realised it was all a nightmare (thank god). I hope it doesn’t become a reality though

I don’t know why but during exam periods I get really vivid and chaotic dreams every single night? Eg the night before I dreamt of taking the subway with Donald trump to the trump tower and my fascinating mind actually made up the entire interior of the tower even though I never knew what it looked like inside. Back in sec 3 I dreamt about getting 0/20 for a physics test too💀

TL;DR: dreamt about getting UUBS/D for A levels, dream was so vivid that I didn’t realise it was a dream when I woke up. A truly frightening experience, do not recommend 😔

All the best for the rest of the papers!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jw71v3/rant_dreamt_about_failing_a_levels/,True,2020-11-18 18:12:37
263,"[Uni] Since it's admissions period, here's a reminder that there are more countries than the US/UK/Aus for studying overseas","I feel like Singaporeans often carry the mindset that only the anglophone countries provide a quality education. But, there are many competitive and well-ranked universities which teach in English in Ireland, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany, France, Japan, the Scandinavian countries. More importantly, public universities in Europe are also far more affordable than studying in the UK/US, which was a big reason for why I wound up choosing to study in the Netherlands. When building my budget for tuition + living expenses, I realised it would be half the cost of studying in Manchester and a third of the cost of studying in London (over three years).

The reason I'm making this post is because I feel that a lot of people are putting themselves into unnecessarily narrow choices of 'either it's the UK or bust', and potentially going to places that aren't even ideal for them because of that. The world is bigger than just that, and you shouldn't feel disappointed if you can't afford or didn't get a place for the country you had in mind.

And while the experience of studying in a place where English isn't the first language is definitely a different one, it's one that I'd argue makes for something genuinely different to living in Singapore. Speaking from my experience alone, education isn't as brutally competitive and exam-centric in non-anglophone countries in Europe. I felt like more space was given to me to explore my extracurriculars and have a life outside of my studies. If anyone has specific questions about studying in the Netherlands, feel free to hit me up!

LASTLY: Make sure to look beyond general university rankings when examining your choice of where to study! If possible, look into specific subject / student life rankings for your university. Your university having loads of research and citations in chemical sciences or medicine is worthless if you're looking to study the humanities. Great universities like Sciences Po are excluded from general rankings because of their hyper focus on a specific field (social sciences). Plus, some universities clearly care a lot more about the quality of your student life than others, something that becomes really obvious even from their website (I would've killed for amenities like a student medical centre).

EDIT: For those interested in my budget for studying in the Netherlands, I've posted it in the comments below!

264,[O Levels] Misunderstandings among Olevel Students?,"So this year im taking olevels and ive been keeping up with reddit throughout my olevel journey. There is one thing that really irritates me a little (im sorry if this makes you feel attacked) and that is the fact that people keep going around stating that you need a minimum of 80-90% to get an A1 for a particular subject. 

  Firstly, i think that these are just some rumours that have been going around. My teacher actually told us that there is no such thing as bellcurve and im sure some small straits times reports have shown that (i am unable to go dig up the quotes if you are looking for evidence but it is true to an extent). Also if what im saying doesnt convince some people, then i want to ask, how is it possible that a huge percentage of people in singapore is able to get above 90% for every single exam. (Esp maths and science) tbh im also from one of the top schools in sg and i can for sure say that ppl in the top class are unable to get 90 even for prelims though our prelims was set at a similar standard to olevels, yet a majority of my seniors get A1 every year. (From past statistics its shown that more than 50% of them get at least 7 distinctions but most of these students werent doing that well during prelims because the average was like B3). 

  I think this has been sorely demoralising for many of us who’ve come to believe that they won’t be able to get their A1 or do as well as they’ve hoped just because of moderation. Lets not cause such unnecessary panic to others, added with the fact that it might not even be real. i doubt that moderation would raise standards till they’re unattainable and out of reach. Please don’t lose hope or buy into the “90 and above for A1” theory, we’ve done our best and our results are just a reflection of our capabilities, not others. 
  
  Basically, to sum this whole rant up, im just saying that everyone shouldnt be concerned with what score you must get in order to achieve your desired result, there is no definite answer and the score to get a distinction can vary each year. So if someone tells you: u must get at least 85% on ur emath to get A1, please just ignore them, because we never know what will happen! I’m sure that your hard work will pay off and SEAB and Cambridge are not here to shortchange you of your grades and efforts. I hope that this gives some people some form encouragement if you are feeling down because you think you are unable to get your desired grade.

For context, I take H2 Biology, H2 Chemistry, H2 Mathematics, H3 NTU Molecular Biology, H1 geography. 

I’ll be offering help to anything you will need (and that I can offer haha). For example questions from tutorials, unsure concepts, or even for the graduating sec 4s if y’all want to know if a subject is “worth” taking or whatsoever you can just PM me and I will answer them whenever I can!! I usually do pretty well for my JC exams but then again I’m not a certified teacher so I cannot guarantee that I will be able to answer to all questions but I will definitely try my best :) 

Really don’t have to be shy about your questions so just ask!! Alevels isn’t easy so make sure you can clarify all your doubt before you reach j2 (where the actual nightmare begins haha). Or if you are just a jc student and want to talk/ rant about your jc life, just hmu :)

268,"[A levels] Disappointed, angry and bitter","Didn’t do very well for A levels and severely underperformed. My actual results were totally unexpected in a bad way and now that I’m done crying, I’m starting to become bitter and have started to go into this endless loop of self loathing and self pitying. 

Imagine devoting 2 years of your life to JC and studying as hard as you can (I’m talking going for as many extra lessons as possible, filling up your entire week with consultations after consultations and staying till 9-10 in school just to study etc) and then scoring shit A level grades. I know this just sounds super whiny or whatever (I really do not give a flying rat’s ass) but I can’t help but feel this growing anger and bitterness in me. When I see people crying about how bad their rank points are while I look at mine, I just feel so inferior and angry at this whole situation. 

It’s so unfair that some people who don’t study still do better than you. You would think maybe hard work pays off and people who work hard will get better grades but I GUESS NOT. I shit you not, one of my friends who had >80 rank points stopped studying after her written papers while I was studying till the very last minute and yet my rank points are so fucking low. I hate the feeling of never being good enough. I hate the feeling of knowing that doing your best just isn’t good enough. I hate the feeling of disappointing my parents who have invested good money in me to ensure I have all the resources I need to do well and feeling like a fucking failure.

In all honesty, I’m lost. I am truly lost as to where to head now and I don’t know if this sounds over dramatic but a part of me really kind of died yesterday the moment I saw my results. It’s like a huge wave of disappointment, shock and sadness washing over you and you can’t explain it except cry about it then enter this loop of self hatred.

269,"[Post Exams][O Levels] Understanding the JAE Procedure, 2021 Edition","A repost of what I wrote last year, with some minor updates. For your weekend reading, so we do not have many posts after the release of results, asking ""*Do I stand a better chance of getting into this course compare to someone who has this score?*"" Well, at least I hope so.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Most (hopefully all) the information you need can be found under Section 3 of your [JAE booklet](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/uploads/2021-JAE-Information-Booklet.pdf), and the flowchart on Page 15 should be useful.

&#x200B;

But here are some examples to answer the common queries about the importance of choice, net and gross aggregates.

&#x200B;

**Example 1**

1 vacancy left in the Arts stream in College X. Student A has an gross (raw) aggregate of 11 with 4 bonus points, with the stream in College X ranked as her first choice. Student B has a gross (raw) aggregate of 10 with 2 bonus points, with the same stream ranked as his first choice.

Student A will be admitted because she has a **better net aggregate** of 7 v Student B's score of 8.

***Main criterion: Net Aggregate Score*** *(accounting for various bonus points,* *~~like being a teacher's pet~~*)

&#x200B;

**Example 2**

1 vacancy left in the Science stream in College Y. Student C has an gross (raw) aggregate of 11 with 4 bonus points, with the stream in College X ranked as her third choice. Student D has a gross (raw) aggregate of 9 with 2 bonus points, with the same stream ranked as his first choice. C is a Singaporean, D is a PR.

Student C and D both have the same net aggregate (7), but C will be admitted because she is a **citizen**, *despite not having a better gross score and ranking the stream as her third choice (v first choice for D).*

***1st Te-breaker: Citizenship*** *(SG Citizen > PR > Foreign students* *~~> aliens~~*)

&#x200B;

**Example 3**

1 vacancy left in Computing in Poly Z. Student E has an gross (raw) aggregate of ~~11~~ 9 with ~~4~~ 2 bonus points, with the course ranked as her first choice. Student F has a gross (raw) aggregate of ~~9~~ 8 with ~~2~~ 1 bonus point, with the same course ranked as his twelfth choice. Both are citizens.

Both students have the same net aggregate (7), but F will be admitted because he has a **better raw score** of ~~9~~ 8, *despite ranking the stream as his twelfth choice (v first choice for E).*

***2nd Te-breaker: Raw/Gross Aggregate Score*** *(Bonus points are NOT taken into consideration)*

&#x200B;

**Example 4**

1 vacancy left in Applied Physics in Poly W. Students G and H are both Singaporeans with the same raw score of 12 with no bonus points. G has the course as her eighth choice, while H has it as his fourth.

A **computer ballot** will then be done and Skynet randomly chooses G to be admitted, *despite the difference in ranking*.

***Final Te-breaker: Computer ballot*** (*~~Skynet may or may not be biased, since it has an intelligence of its own, or maybe it becomes self-aware after this excercise~~*)

&#x200B;

All the best!

&#x200B;

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

Some other common questions:

*1) The COP listed for the course “How to be a Jedi Master” is 12. I have a net aggregate of 13. Does that mean I do not qualify for the course?*

The COP given in the JAE Booklet refers to the net aggregate score of the worst-performing applicant in the 2020 admission exercise. It does not reflect the cut-off for the admission exercise in 2021.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

*2) What are my chances of getting into Bear JC if I have a net aggregate of 8, just meeting last year’s COP?*

I do not own a TARDIS (actually, I do have two non-functioning models built with Lego, but I digress), nor am I the companion of The Doctor. I have no knowledge of the future, and even if I do, I will put that knowledge to better use. The COP this year will depend on the quality of applicants in this year’s cohort.

&#x200B;

*3) I understand you do not have a crystal ball, but can you predict how the COP will change this year?*

~~Here is my prediction: All COP will fall to 0. Yes, you need to be perfect~~. I cannot and will not. I will, however, point you towards the [historical COP](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14b5VLIr9W5teiOp0vCg86B6xxpFiwk8jeIzwbdJmWjU/pubhtml) (kudos to the person or persons maintaining this), and let you draw your own conclusions.  


&#x200B;

*4) I have 12 points, but I failed Subject Y. I am not sure if I meet the requirements. Can I still apply for Course A?*

*5) How do I calculate my L1R5/ELR2B2, etc*

There is no need to worry able the eligible courses, or your aggregate score. Your result slip will will include the different aggregate scores, as well as the courses you are eligible to apply for (see Page 9 for a sample). However, being able to apply to Course X does not guarantee you a place in it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kt57w0/post_examso_levels_understanding_the_jae/,True,2021-01-09 07:56:05

271,[UNI] ALL ABOUT NUS LAW 1.0! (+ AMA),"Hello! I’m a current NUS Law year 3 student. This post is inspired by the other similar posts about other NUS faculties which are extremely well-written so I hope this will meet the lofty standards set by the other faculties =). This post seeks to provide **general information for those considering about NUS Law or a career in law since the other schools (SMU and SUSS) have greatly similar law curriculum as well as to clarify some doubts about a legal education in our local universities**.

I understand that unfortunately there is no physical open house this year and frankly I am unsure about the school's plan for outreach because the information doesn't seem to be available via the school portal. I will edit this post and update you guys as soon as the school provides some information. Nonetheless, I will be happy to engage in discussions on this thread or via a pm and I will do my best to answer to your queries promptly. To my fellow law school pals in this thread, would be happy to invite you to share your perspective with prospective freshmen as well =) Thank you in advance for chiming in.

\*\*Disclaimer: the tips that I give are entirely based on my own perception so please don't take it as gospel. But these are information that I have shared to my current juniors before they entered law school and they mentioned that they found it useful so hope this helps!

Just some background context about myself: I came from the A-level route, have been through the internships and training contract galore in law. A training contract is like the doctor's equivalent of houseman or a trainee in some other courses and a stepping stone to a full-time job. So yeap, now  just focused on grinding to get decent grades to graduate =)

**1 Curriculum**

*The general curriculum* (latest caa the current academic year) can be found [here](http://www.law.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/llb_prog/pdfs/typ_sch_llb_1920_after.pdf)

Generally, the first 2 years are dedicated to core modules that will serve as the foundational subjects. This means that most modules are pre-allocated and there is little choice besides the option of trial advocacy or corporate deals in semester 2 of year 2. These core modules are very important as the skills and knowledge taught  will be very useful for any subjects or legal endeavours that you will pursue in the future. For instance, the Legal Analysis, Research and Communications module taken in year 1 imparts the core skills that you require to write a proper legal memorandum and argue your case in court in the future. To top it off, the final moot assessment is akin to a mock trial where you will argue your case in court. Other modules like contract law and company law are very prevalent issues that will arise in the modern commercial world that we live in today.

In year 3 and year 4, you get to select modules with the exception of a compulsory module called Evidence Law. This is when you get to select from a wide array of law based on your interests: like shipping law, construction law or public international law just to name a few.

Also, just to clarify, law follows the NUS study semesters to a tee, unlike medicine and dentistry so rest assured that you will be having breaks, reading weeks and exams the same time as the rest of your NUS peers.

For year 1, you will generally be taking 4 modules (Criminal law, tort law, contract law and LARC) that will last for an entire year while you will be taking another 2 modules each in 1 semester (Singapore Law in Context and Introduction to Legal Theory). You will generally expect to have roughly 15 (+-2) hours of lesson weekly, which might seem heavenly compared to the 6-8 contact hours daily in Junior College.

However, welcome to university: you will need to prepare for class especially tutorials or you risk getting lost in class. The preparation time for each class will be entirely up to you. Generally speaking, it is realistic to spend up to 10 hours weekly for each of the year-long subjects because there are just so many cases and academic material to digest. But rest assured, there is a wealth of material (affectionately known as muggers) and study guides painstakingly prepared and refined by generations of seniors that regularly gets passed on from batch to batch. So do continue to pay it forward and continue this tradition when you're a freshman =)

*Lesson format + Lecturers/Tutors*

The lessons will be either in the form of seminar, tutorials or a cohort based lecture. About 50% of your lessons will be tutorials (10-12 per class to 1 tutor) or seminars (50 per class to 1 tutor), with the other 50% being a cohort based lecture. Lectures and tutorials are usually 2 hours long while seminars are 3 hours long and there is usually a short break in between. All classes are unfortunately not webcasted and certain seminars/tutorials do take attendance which counts towards class participation

Lecturers and tutors are prominent academics or professionals with a wealth of experience from the legal industry. Most of them are very well-respected in the profession and are regularly cited in court decisions. From personal experience, a large majority of them can teach very well and are very receptive to feedback, so feel free to let them know if you have any difficulties about the class.

Oh and I haven't mentioned, certain classes will be taught by lawyers that are still practising and have day jobs so some classes will be held at night as a result.

Materials will be entirely provided for by the course convenor (reading lists). The general databases like Lawnet comes with your student status and the law library is well stocked with every possible legal material you need.

*Internship*

In NUS Law, internships are entirely based on your own onus. SMU Law has a compulsory 10 week internship graduation requirement. Do note that for either school, internships are SELF SOURCED. So you will need to visit each of the firms' websites, find out about what they specialise in and whether it aligns with your career aspirations. However, rest assured that the school provides regular updates via email blast on internship opportunities and has a dedicated career guidance team to provide guidance whenever you require. What's more, you can always rely on the trusty source of advice - word of mouth and your seniors.

Generally, students will do internships during their respective breaks in the summer or winter breaks. Most internships last 3-4 weeks. Students generally do an average of 2-3 internships in total before they start applying for training contracts from year 3, just so that they get a good exposure to the legal profession. The experience for each law firm varies but from personal experience, there is a fair bit that a legal intern can do and an internship will definitely be a valuable experience since your legal knowledge will no doubt give you the ability to complete useful legal work.

*Training contract application*

This will happen from year 3 onwards as students are usually able to apply once they obtain their year 2 semester 2 results.

Similar to internships, this is entirely up to you to apply to the respective firms by the respective deadlines and the available avenues for information will always be there for you. Furthermore, the school organises a yearly career fair for law firms to come down and share with the students. Training contracts are usually be awarded based on internship evaluation as well as interview.

This is the point where I want to debunk the myth of the glut of law students looking for a limited amount of training contracts, the glut is easing definitely and a large percentage of my current batch (year 3) have already secured their training contracts. Moreover, there are still a good number of training contracts out there available for students and most that do not have a contract is because they do not find a good fit out there or entirely based on choice (i.e not entering practice). The ""say real"" opinion is that local graduates, regardless of academic results, will largely be able to find a training contract so long as they want to =) The glut that the news reported are more of a factor for ""Relevant Legal Training"", which is a requirement for overseas graduates and not local graduates. So rest assured if the paucity of training contracts is weighing on your decision to enter NUS Law.

*Pro Bono*

There is a CIP equivalent called pro-bono and there is a requirement of 10 mandatory hours for all 4 years. It is honestly very easy to hit the hours because the school regularly provides opportunities like legal clinics or legal talks + there is a club dedicated to organising such pro-bono opportunities. If you cannot hit the hours, say real lor - really your own pasar already for not seeking these opportunities

&#x200B;

**2. NUS Law student life opportunities**

*Unrestricted Electives*

You are allowed to take a maximum of 3 unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the law curriculum and a good chance to meet people from other faculties. However, you can only do so in year 3 and year 4

*Student life in Law*

The student life in law is vibrant. There are many sub clubs like the pro-bono club which is like the service learning club in JC), NUS Law club which is like JC's equivalent of student council, Criminal Justice Club which does programmes about criminal justice in Singapore etc, or the Mooting club if you are interested in things like debating. There is also sports interests groups where students prepare for sports meets like the Inter-Faculty Games in NUS, Law-Fraternity games with the legal profession and lastly the Law-Medicine Games. In addition, pop-up groups like Dance and Arts have recently popped up, thanks to the outstanding push of initiatives by the current law club. You are not required to join any clubs and everything is up to your choice.

*Balancing other interests and passion in school*

There is also the misconception that since the law faculty is stuck in Bukit Timah Campus away from the main Kent Ridge Campus, most students just stay in law school and you will be stuck with a social circle of just law students. This is untrue. There are many students who live on Kent Ridge Campus as the BTC bus that connects the two campuses follow a strict time table so it provides a reliable, convenient mode of transport. Besides, travelling between the two locations only take up to 20-25 minutes on a good day so it is really not that far away. A good number also have Kent Ridge CCAs like dance or sports and are still able to reasonably balance with the academic endeavours.

Personally, I did join an NUS-wide dance group in year 3. It was an amazing experience performing and improving my skills, 10/10 would recommend. Most of my friends have other commitments out of school like being a leader in Church, joining external groups so it's really not all work and no play in law school.

*Exchange Programmes*

NUS Law partners with a wide range of universities and students generally go in either semester 1 or 2 in year 3. There are a few year-long exchanges but it would require some juggling of modules to meet the graduation requirement. More information can be found [here](https://law.nus.edu.sg/student_matters/student_ex.html)

However, do note that students generally apply in year 2 for exchange and exchange is not compulsory. The awarding of places is entirely based on grades and based on the demand of your batchmates, so if you want to go to your desired exchange places be prepared to work for it.

&#x200B;

**3 Admission Information**

*Indicative Grade Profiles A Levels 2019*

10th percentile: AAA/A

90th percentile: AAA/A

Note on A-levels: generally 87.5 RP should grant you at least the interview and written test, after that it is entirely based on your performance there. Having a slightly lower RP will mean that you likely have to rely on DA.

*Polytechnic GPA 2019*

10th percentile: 3.86/4.0

90th percentile: 3.93/4.0

*Admission requirements:*

There is a ***compulsory*** written test and interview which will be held in April. Interviews will be held 17-18 Apr 2020 while the written test is on 19 Apr 2020

*Tips for Admission Interviews*

a) Written statement

There is a written one page statement to be brought in to the interview on why do you wish to join NUS Law and from my personal experience, my interviewer refer to it to probe questions on why I want to join NUS Law.

Think through why you want to come to NUS Law and make it as personalised as possible. Like what you hear about the school, read the website, what interests you etc.

So write your statement well like any normal essay and always have a good structure for your paragraphs: Point - Elaboration/Examples - Explanation - Link back to your point. Make sure your first sentence runs with your last sentence of each paragraph.  Also, you should make your language clear so that the point comes through most effectively. Try to be as direct as possible because the interviewer or the assessor will in some way refer to it somehow. What I mean by direct is for example you are interested in community service, there is a law equivalent called pro bono and you can say like you want to learn legal knowledge and how to apply them to practical problems. At the same time, show your passion for community service via past examples like meet the people sessions etc. Be very familiar with the personal statement so that you can elaborate on them during the interview and the interviewer can refer to it and know that you have prepared thoroughly, thinking through why you want to come to NUS law.

b) Interview

2 interviewers to you in a room, I think it was a 10-15 minutes interview unless the format has changed.

Be yourself as much as possible, same thing as above, be very clear and to the point. Don’t beat around the bush because many of us always have the ramble syndrome and then realising after quite some time, till then you might have lost your audience already. I find it best to always use Point-Elaboration/Examples - Evaluation as a solid foundational structure. Answer the question upfront in your first statement and it will help if you signpost. This also helps to ensure that your entire answer is focused specifically towards answering the question rather than spitting out random thoughts in your head and vomiting everything you read, often with few link to the main question. For example, they will more likely or not ask you why you want to come to NUS Law. Say straight up - like I want to come for 2 main reasons: student life and pro bono activities. Then explain with examples so that it is more personalised and then at the end conclude and bring back to the main point of the question why you want to come to NUS Law.

Also, you need to know at least what interests you in law and not give a generalised one. Think through carefully again and make it very personal will be best. For instance, you can know which area of law you are interested in and why: eg. I am interested in Family Law because I witnessed first hand during an internship with Legal Aid Bureau that Singapore's legal regulation of family law is optimal for the child's welfare.

Last of all, treat it like a conversation. Make it natural and flow because part of being a lawyer requires you to present your case and persuade! If you really need to, try and practice talking about law or just general current affairs to a friend =) If the conversation flows, that's a sign that you are on the right track. You might even want to practise answering questions with all the pointers I said above - trust me it will go a long way to building up great interview skills

c) Written test:

The written test will be similar to your AQ in A-level JC. It will give you a scenario. I will give an example for my year(2015) for you to get a better idea: The question was about a section in the mental capacity act: whether a mentally disabled person should be allowed to bear children, for fear of the children's safety and upbringing should something go haywire. Sorry I'm abit outdated with this information cos I took the test so long ago so those juniors who have newer information, will be very grateful for you to chime in.

For tips: likewise for everything, be very logical. Stick religiously to Point-Elaboration/Examples - Evaluation so that you can make your point clear. Have a good introduction and conclusion also and remember that BOTH must answer to the question. Also, they really don’t expect you to know too much about the law before the test because it is very unreasonable for them to do so. So, use as much of the facts in the question as much as possible, use it as your backing and you will be alright. I can’t give specific examples because questions are so different each year. But it is like the application question in comprehension you did in JC, use the material in the question well. To illustrate my point I will also give an example: For instance with my sample question in 2015: I talked about how the subject in question went through life like a normal person like being toilet trained or going out independently shows that she can function like a normal human being. Likewise, she was able to keep a pet goldfish well and it isn't a leap of logic to expect the same standards for her when caring for a child as well.

*Scholarships*

All the general scholarships like stat board scholarships, PSC, SAF apply to law. Also, there are a few faculty scholarships for outstanding students. The application details can be found on the general NUS website on scholarships, which is [here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/scholarships)

&#x200B;

**4 The legal profession**

*Concerns about the job*

I will not profess to know much about the legal profession because I am not in the profession yet. But one of the biggest gripes is work-life balance and the insanely long working hours. My simple response to them is - which other profession do not require the pre-requisite of hard work? Take for instance: some of my programming friends work very long hours coding and most at start-ups stay in office, for doctors/accountants don't even get me started lol. What's more, we can observe a clear increase in emphasis when looking at work-life balance in many law firms today. Many allow for flexible working hours etc and generally the people I spoke to during internships seem to say that it is manageable. Furthermore, the very nature of the legal profession where high standards and having to do due diligence when churning out work really requires the preparation (as you will get a taste of in law school just how sensitive some legal issues are). So it is best we view it as work-life integration. If so many seniors have been able to do it, so can I =)

*Salary*

Law is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market and this is well-documented. Do note that the salary is only AFTER you have secured retention, which means after training contract.

More information can be found [here](https://blog.seedly.sg/graduate-starting-salary-nus-ntu-smu-sutd-sit/).

*Career progression*

If you stay in practice, the progression is generally from associate to senior associate to partner etc.

The law degree is also very versatile, a large number of lawyers become legal counsels in various other companies in other industries or work in statutory boards. This is as much as your concern should go haha, job security is something to worry about at a later date =)

&#x200B;

**5 Other FAQs not addressed**

*Local or Overseas legal education, which is better?*

This would entirely up to your perception on what you deem as better. While it may be less stressful overseas, you must also consider several drawbacks, like the costs, the breadth of the teaching there and having to pick up local knowledge if you want to practice locally. Having had 2.5 years of legal education in Singapore, I would say that there is a fair bit different in the local positions compared to overseas and you must note that most overseas in UK/Australia do not touch Singapore cases at all. The overseas students I met during internship did mention that it is a struggle to pick up legal knowledge on the job during internships so I would take that into consideration if I were in your position. For instance, the duty of care position (a common tort issue) is VERY different in Australia and UK. Also, take note of the Part A passing rates =)! Local students don't have to do part A.

Lastly, there are exchange opportunities if you want to experience an overseas education and the semester there will be grade free =) I rest my case.

*Is law school environment hostile and toxic?*

My answer to this is a resounding no. Like with any other place, there is bound to be politics involved and it is all about perception! As the common saying goes ""Do not do unto others what you do not want others to do unto you"". Besides the law population is so small, being a douchebag will definitely not get you very far and your reputation will definitely be in tatters.

The law school population is generally very very friendly. Seniors are very generous in passing on their notes and sharing any knowledge with juniors. There are regular collaborations among batches to pass on to the juniors eg. there was a very nicely compiled freshman guide this year and the y2(current y3) batch also compiled their internship experiences for the juniors.

My batchmates are mostly friendly as well and we do build great relationship here. My circle of friends share internship experiences, notes and any tips freely. So rest assured =)

*Is law school competitive*

Yes it is competitive but i'll explain. First, there must be a distinction drawn between competitiveness and a toxic environment. Competitiveness entails more of having high standards while toxic is just an unhealthy environment where it is difficult to find true human emotions.

So yes, law school is competitive simply because many students have similar rank points (in the 85-90RP range) so naturally the ability of the students will be very high! Sometimes, I walk into class thinking that ah I have done my readings, only to get torn apart by the tutor and watching my friends ace-ing all the questions, right on point. But one must learn to always persevere and never give up. Tutors and professors are more than happy to make time for you to consult them. Law students are generally in the confined BTC campus and you can readily find friends to discuss your work together. Moreover, seniors are more than happy to offer advice whenever you need them.

Therefore, don't worry =) I have really built genuine friendships during law school - from internship, classes, clubs, interests etc and I look forward everyday to those deep, genuine conversations with my pals. Even a simple meet up along the corridor asking each other how we are doing can go a long way in brightening up all our days. So not to worry about the competitiveness, I'm sure you can find an environment suitable for you to thrive!

*What should I do before law school? Do I need to prepare?*

No, please do not, the effort to reward ratio is far too low because you can definitely be able to pick up studying again when you are back at school. If you really insist, you can do a legal internship and have a glimpse of the legal industry. However, the value you can provide is limited because you have not been through any sort of legal education unfortunately.

Go enjoy, do what you want and love. I personally went for the MOE Teaching internship and loved every aspect of it, it inspired me to join volunteer work teaching children which I do till this very day.

Last of all, look out for the orientation activities painstakingly planned by the orientation committee. There is law camp, RAG, matriculation and pro bono among many other activities. PLEASE JOIN THEM BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST WAY TO MAKE FRIENDS FROM DAY 1 in law school trust me on this. More information can be found here on their [Instagram](https://www.google.com/search?q=nus+law+orientation&oq=nus+law+orientation+&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l2j69i64l2.4983j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NUSLawOrientation/) or their official [website](https://nuslaworientation.com/matriculation-week). All these are to be updated and the first activity is usually the welcome tea in May followed by law camp in June.

*How different is studying in law than studying for A-levels?*

Quite a fair bit different. The workload is similar to A-levels but different because A-levels you are spoonfed materials while in law school, you actually have to analyse cases + draw links + critique positions. However, rest assured that the curriculum will guide you to that level =) you will be just fine. Also, tests/exams are mostly open book with some small exceptions. I've hardly need to resort to extreme memorisation as much as I had to in JC lol, but doesn't mean that I fare well also but let's just say the amount of material to memorise for A-levels was enormous and something I would definitely not like to relive

*What is the honours system like in NUS Law?*

All of the law degrees are honours, with first class for the top 5% in the cohort, second upper for up to 60-65% of the cohort and second lower for the remainder. The school generally doesn't give third class unless you are really absent from school etc and to quote the dean, ""even if you tried very very hard, we will be hard pressed to even give you a third class honour"". That being said, 2nd upper is generally what most students aim for but 2nd lower is not exactly that damning as people think it would be. Take note also that for training contracts, much of it is based on interviews, internship performance and fit. So I'd just say don't put too much pressure on yourself, even though competition might be stiff in law school because afterall, a large majority of us are the cream of the A-level crop and stiff competition is a natural result of it.

*How is the assessment criteria like beyond exams? Are there class participation and group work.*

Yes there are generally exams that are take home or in the exam venue. It differs from modules. Also, there might be a certain percentage for assignments which are generally a written essay or a presentation or two.

Class participation might sound daunting to people but rest assured that most professors are very fair - by that I mean some go through a rolling system to call on people every class or if you haven't spoken much and want to offer a point of view, the professors would be very happy to hear from you. Also, from my personal experience, most of us are generally very civil when it comes to such class participation so fret not, it won't be hunger games-like.

As for group work, unlike other faculties (i.e. biz), it is generally less common and exams still take a large majority of the assessment for most modules. Certain group work usually don't expand beyond 3-4 people and group work is usually a small percentage of the grade only. So fret not if you do not feel comfortable working in a group and are worried about it. BUT it is always good to practice your collaboration skills in a sheltered environment in school, it would definitely go a long way in your career because teamwork is an integral aspect of the legal profession.

*Why did I join law school?*

Frankly, due to practicality reasons of a stable job with decent prospects. Because my family background (lower percentiles on the income scale) and my mum kind of pressured me into taking one of Med-Den-Law. I was a science student in JC and was unable to get into Dentistry. However, I must say that thank God I have found my calling in law. It is a tough course ngl and I struggle a lot in school because I take much longer to understand material and piece them together, also being surrounded by many gifted people does make you feel small at times but yes it does train my perseverance to just do your best. Most importantly, law is a versatile degree and allows me a broad perspective of the world around me. It sharpens my reasoning capacity and my critical thinking of issues. For instance, I have learnt that brevity is very important when answering questions and I even use this in my daily conversations: answer the question first then give your reasons.

Lastly, I do have a passion for service in law. The most fulfilling experiences that I have embarked on was a deputyship application for those without mental capacity to make decisions for themselves. Getting the court order out at the end was really just a great icing on the cake and help give the family a peace of mind amidst unfortunate circumstances. Having to do it outside on the open market costs upwards of $5000 and I am glad I was able to do my part as a student for the family

*How do I know I am suitable for a legal education and moving further, a legal career?*

You really have to ask yourself what about law excites you: Is it getting justice for certain groups of people? Or is it understand how the legal issues work in the corporate world?

Where you can garner such inspirations is best found through your own experiences: so you should ideally go for internships in law firms, talk to students or talk to practising lawyers about how their jobscope is like. Although before entering law school you may not have the legal knowledge yet, but I would also advise you to possibly talk about issues that you are interested in - be it technology or family law etc, talk it out with a student or a practising lawyer and perhaps you can then have a better gauge if this is truly what you are passionate about. Last but not least, shows or documentaries like Suits are fine, but please temper it with some dose of reality haha, by supplementing it with actual court/firm practices.

Law school is challenging ngl, you need to be able to read tons and tons cases (up in the hundreds of pages), analyse statutes, evaluating all possible viewpoints of a certain legal position. But not to worry, the curriculum is carefully designed to guide you as such - so just remember to always find your passion in law and what got you interested in law whenever you are feeling lost.

*Must I have a strong command in language*

Ideally yes, but this does not necessary mean flowery/bombastic language - **more so that it is clarity in expression and also good grammar**. Profs ideally prefer your answer to be clear and to the point - this is a skill that you will cultivate in law school. More often or not, if you use bombastic expression (like saying stuff like the law is the bastion of evil against the ills of society etc) - you better make sure it serves a point or not it will only go towards irritating your professor and making it seem like you are trying to smoke your way through. 

Personally, I grew up speaking Mandarin at home and heavily relied on Singlish cos I was a void deck soccer kid LOL. I struggled to switch my thinking from Chinese to English during my early schooling days but I kept a focus on having good grammar and decent expression (clarity) - which worked for me a lil so I would highly recommend focusing on these if you'd struggle like me. But rest assured, you will be able to practice these skills in law school so fret not =D

*NUS Law vs SMU Law?*

Ah that is an age old debate. Honestly, much of these considerations are very subjective. I have highlighted some of my own personal considerations in the replies below. Beyond that, I am glad to defer to the following posts with excellent insights from fellow law students who have gave it much more thought. Full credits to them:

1. What are the considerations for students who chose either schools: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gi2r61/uni_seniors_who_chose_smu_law_over_nus_law_what/) (I highly recommend looking at u/Apprehensive_Donkey's explanation of the lecture system in NUS Law, I completely agree with this POV and hope you all can take into consideration)
2. Why an incoming freshman is choosing SMU Law with insights about the difference between 2 schools in the comments section: [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gjdxi8/uni_why_im_choosing_smu_law/) (there are some detailed sharing about SMU Law and their methodologies, along with some insights about NUS Law = highly recommended to read!)

On a final note, I would like to conclude by saying that everything here is very much subjective: you must weigh what is good for yourself. The opportunities are out there and plentiful in either schools and ultimately it is only YOU who can define how you grasp these opportunities.

272,[Rant] The only one in the class who pass geography exam . It isn’t always sunshine and rainbows.,"Sec 3 NA.

When I kinda did well in geography and was the only one who pass in class. When we pass around the score sheet to sign on it to acknowledge that you get the correct marks, my geography friends told me, “shut the FK up at least you pass” 

I hate sharing my marks as people keep asking me how much I got, I would tell them and they get so fking pissed.

I was at least trying to be grateful for scoring that marks but with all the remarks that I received that just 📉📉😀.

Take note : On the exam day itself, there were two papers. All of them were focusing on chemistry paper instead and said this before geog exam while the examiner ( my form teacher) was there , “FK geog,my humanities is already FKed so fk it .”Did y'all study geography?” 

Studying for geog was never easy as I would have mental breakdown constantly.
I spent months prior studying for geography as the content is quite heavy, my parents won't be happy if I'm one mark away from getting an A :) . When will I be good enough for someone?

There's always this stigma when I did well. 
Every time an exam comes around, they would say ”confirm she would do well”, I said no (wasn't trying to be humble but I had very low confidence in doing well ) and people say ”Aiya, she confirm will do well, look at her notes la” ”stop lying that you won't do well la”🙃 

The thing is I took some time out to consult my geography teacher 3 days in a row to ask vital questions, ask for tips, clarify my doubts, ask my teacher to mark my 6 marks essay and I told her to go through with me and tell me how I can do better and what content I was lacking. 
All the questions I ask did come out for the exam💚(there was no hint given by the teacher or whatsoever)

277,[JC] A word of caution about ambition,"Hey there, I'm a J1 currently studying in a mid-tier JC and I felt that this is just something I have to put out. I'm not expecting many people to read this but if you're here then thank you for your time!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

To start out, there is no question that most people have dreams for the future regardless of their abilities, skills and circumstances. It is then with no surprise that that desire usually translates to ambition in some form or another, driving one to work hard for attainment.

I didn't do very well for PSLE and I admitted to a neighbourhood secondary school. I think that was when it dawned on me that no matter how inclined I was to subjects that weren't covered in school, I would only ever be able to fulfil my dreams of studying them if I actually got into university. So naturally, this much needed (albeit late) enlightenment motivated me to get down to work and grind it out for O-Levels.

I was both blessed and cursed in that being in said secondary school with poor/loose management and people not as inclined to studies meant that teachers were always free for consultations, extra classes were easy to arrange. I was even granted the privilege to start a sub CCA branching from the main one I was in. It was run semi-autonomously by a small group of 5 (including me) with limited administration and supervision from the teachers-in-charge which granted us the breathing space we needed to explore and develop our skills as per our interest. (A little like Tomoe Gakuen's teaching style if you will, Totto-chan)

If anything, this experience only served to strengthen my resolve as the sub-CCA gave me a taste of what I wanted so badly to study through competitions and seminars.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

So basically, this led to an all-consuming lifestyle centred around school work (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) throughout the first two years of school and naturally, the effort showed in the results (not that I'm being proud here, don't get me wrong).

This was the stuff of dreams for me: 8 subjects (incl. DNT) and what was essentially 2 CCAs. This meant that I never ran out of work to do and ambition was surging every day from dateline to dateline. It brought me great satisfaction handing each piece of work early, knowing that I had put hard work into it.

Up to this point, you may be thinking,"" Well there's nothing unusual about that..."" and you'd be right about that, but hear me out okay, it what happened in Sec 3/4 that I want to focus on.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

On to the real stuff. While this model had worked well with me up till the start of Sec 3, cracks had already started to appear in Sec 1, cracks that I had initially ignored but were becoming too pronounced to do so by Mid Sec 3. It was apparent that though my report cards (anything school-related actually) were impeccable, my lifestyle was quite the opposite. I was regularly sleeping past midnight to meet my assignment datelines (mind you, I wasn't because I procrastinated but simply because I couldn't stop working), I had inadequate methods of coping with stress (yes, I was stressed even when I slept) and I was taking every opportunity to convert time with family and friends into study time. It was also at the time that we (my close-knit group of friends from the sub-CCA) were under tremendous pressure to perform in competitions as our success was the only thing keeping our main CCA from closing due to school budget cuts. Lastly, my performance ranking had dropped for the MYEs. It was then only a matter of time that I, under the tremendous pressure I was under, cracked.

Soon after that, everything came to a grinding halt.

Dramatic emphasis aside, it was too late to turn back now that I  found myself burned out badly. This meant that I had absolutely no motivation to work and suddenly, it became daunting to look at the sheer workload I had to shoulder. Depression soon joined the party (two's a party?) and took misery up a couple of notches. Still, because mopping around ain't getting that sweet sweet 6pts I found myself getting back at working again. As my ambition was still all fired up while I was absolutely tired out, my drive simply dragged me along on in the dirt hoping to win a race I knew I would never win. True enough, this effort, while enough to get me a decent score for EOYs, further destroyed my mental state and sent me spiralling into undiagnosed mental health issues which cranked the misery up to 11.

At this point, I was having difficulty maintaining an appetite, went sleepless and was unable to remember things at all. Naturally, my grades suffered no matter how hard I studied and paid attention to class. It was a low point where I was the most aware of the true nature of my situation, unadulterated by ambition, yet the most lost as to what the next step forward was. It certainly didn't help that DNT coursework meant that I had to produce a \~100page A3 journal, working prototype and 3 A2 presentation boards by September 3rd while managing my other subjects.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I know that this post is getting really long so I'll cut short the end of the story. I managed to implement new studying strategies and recovery schemes to fix my broken lifestyle (not completely) sufficiently in time for O-Levels and managed to score decently well. I had already set my mind on the JC I wanted to admit to but I knew that that would never come true given the terrible state of mind I was in during the year. True enough, try as I might, I didn't score well enough to admit and am now studying in a JC that I had only ever considered as my 5th choice at best.

You can decide if my story in secondary school had a happy ending. A lot has changed yet so little; I'm essentially back at square one as I was back in sec 1 fresh out of PSLE, which brings me to the conclusion of my post:

It's good to have dreams and its great to be motivated to throw yourself and work towards them. However, it can never hurt to give your mental health a little more attention just to make sure that you don't fall down the rabbit hole of working yourself to a dead-end.

&#x200B;

To everyone taking their examinations, I wish you the very best in all your endeavours!

&#x200B;

Edit: 

After reading some of the comments, I think many have pointed out something that I think is worth emphasizing here. It is not wrong to have heavy commitments. In fact, its a good thing to be actively involved with your school community. I'm not trying to encourage anyone to shy from taking risks like taking up leadership roles or involvement in other demanding programmes. However, it is important to do so knowing that you will be able to manage it well.

Everything has a trade off whether you see it or not. Just be sure that you can bear that cost.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i6hf0y/jc_a_word_of_caution_about_ambition/,True,2020-08-10 02:49:40

But you guys put me to shame :') Thank you very much... It's a struggle to fight against my mental conscience. Singapore society doesn't approve those with mental conditions.

I am currently trying my best at the moment to overcome and looked forward. I hope everyone is healthy and safe. Again, thank you for the messages. The past events has been in my mind haunting me. I am feeling a bit better, (still have opposite thoughts.) Seeing your messages made me feel light in my heart.
You guys are the best!!!!

Quite a lengthy story. Anyone who reads this, thank you for your attention. 

In 2016, I was diagnosed with Anorexia Nervosa. Long story, I was a lonely kid in secondary school who has low social skills. I thought if I lose weight, I would obtain happiness and people will look at me differently. NOT. I just got skinnier and skinnier. I was like a stick. Sitting down was painful as my bones can be seen underneath a thin layer of skin. I was very hungry that I couldn't concentrate anything. I went to get psychiatrist help as my condition was getting worse. My psychiatrist sent me to psychological therapist.

I was given depressive meds as the psychiatrist found my mood often swings. I could go from content to agitated. Time didn't make it better...

O levels were approaching and I wasn't cured yet from the ED. I got L1R5 20 points in O levels.

I was devastated. I cried very hard on that day. My friends in my class didn't bother to ask how I was. They have the best results and are going to JC. My close friend from secondary one soon comforted me.

I thought I could choose the course I wanted, nutrition since the course numbers in my result slip stated so. The system ended up putting me in RP Clean Energy. WHICH I did not put in my course choices. 

I couldn't choose nutrition. I have to choose an engineering course. I come from a pure science background and the concepts were so foreign. Coming into poly life, I decided to change myself from the socially awkward kid to a friendly young adult. 

I engaged myself in conversation. I was able to talk on a one-to-one basis. Being a large group was quite terrifying for me. Nonetheless, I was glad to be in a group of girls in my class. Soon, drama erupted and the group split into two. 

Being in poly, it was a big struggle as I am constantly fighting with my ED. I have anxiety attacks. I felt left out in class as my friends find other people they considered close. They grew worse when my group leave me hanging. It deeply affected me emotionally.
I remembered rushing to the bathroom cubicle and sobbing hard. 

I become withdrawn from class and kept a lowkey profile. I felt like secondary school days are coming back to me. I constantly fight myself to maintain my conscience. I find myself slipping back to my old habits. I couldn't speak without stuttering. I didn't want to speak in my normal tone or else I would draw attention. I ducked my head down to avoid standing out. 

 I thought quitting poly as I didn't want to go back to class to see the people who left me. I chose nyp nursing since it was one of the courses that fit my o levels. I went through the DAE interview and got accepted. However, the teacher on the phone warned me something crucial.

All poly students are given ten subsided semesters. I completed four semesters and left with six semesters: three years. If I failed a semester in nyp, I would have to pay full amount. 

 I didn't want to risk my family finances. Yet I didn't want to go to class everyday, seeing people mingling around while I am left behind. It constantly mocks me how I was such a coward, I should have try harder so people won't leave me, how much of a failure I was back in the days. 
 
It's draining to keep a happy smile while everyone is surrounded with friends.

 I could keep up with the pace as I forced myself to study. I grouped with the minority in my class and carried the whole team. I got a gpa 3.02 in year two but it isn't sufficient for me. I wanted to study a course I wanted. Getting into a science course from an engineering background is going to be difficult as I competed with others who clearly have a better background.

Days goes by, year three came. I am in an elective class so I won't be able to meet with any of my former clique. However, I feel like my past is coming to haunt me. First semester was SIP. I was with two other interns. I decided that maybe I got a chance to restart and talk to them. 

Then the pandemic comes. SIP got postponed. I quarantined for two months while doing hbl. My medication ran out of supply. My doctor appointments got postponed. My mood grew worse as I struck in these four walls. 

The CB lifted and the company stated that we could come back. I dreaded the coming days till graduation. 

I tried to talk with the two interns. Most of the conversation were between the two of them while I was like the third wheel. I began to feel self-conscious. I began to analyze their body language and conversation. Their eye contact and the way they speak.

I don't know why was I even trying hard. I just don't want to be left hanging like in the past. 

Then everything comes down. Tension built between us. 
I don't know why but I couldn't talk with one of them... I tried hard to initiate like giving sweets or having lunch.. 

What hits me hard when I saw them leaving. I was closing my workspace. There's only one entrance in the office. 
I saw them walking to the exit. One of them as excepted didn't look at me. Another just stared at me, shocked or speechless. They continued their way without saying anything to me. I didn't utter also because...I was scarred. All the past memories came crashing on me. My hopes to make friends vanished. 

I am tired of trying and losing again. I dreaded going back the next day. I tried to ask my teacher to change my SIP company. Due to the ongoing pandemic, many companies terminated students.hence there is no more slots. 

I don't know what to say or do when I see them tomorrow. I don't want to go through another pain. I don't know why am I reacting so sensitive. I admired anyone who gone through shit and came out like a badass. I didn't have the strength to face people.

I feared my future. I have to face people again. Any social interaction fails triggers my pathetic self. I find myself having more panic attacks. I couldn't breath. I couldn't sleep. I guess you could say I am constantly on the edge? Everything is coming to me back and forth. I can't seem to contain.

TDLR; I am diagnosed with ED and anxiety. I am at lost to do what. I am scared of the pain. The rejection from other people. I am at lost on what to do.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h8ntqv/rant_emotionally_distorted/,True,2020-06-14 21:16:50
280,[A levels] Retaking after A levels,"Lmao this is probably the only thing I'm gonna post on this forum haha. This is specifically for those of you who may not have fared as well and may not have a good chance of getting into your desired course. I am writing this because I personally feel there is not much information out there regarding retaking and I just want to be of help :)

A year ago, upon receiving my results, I was speechless and my mind blanked. 66.25 RP. Realisation dawned on me that I could not enter the courses of my choice and this was followed by balling my eyes out for the next two days. I had to make a decision: poly? private uni? overseas? retake? A lot of factors came into play, such as time; cost; prestige (superficial i know) etc. Ultimately I decided to retake as it was the shortest route towards entering the big 3 local uni (with the course of choice).

Firstly, I had to retake it privately since I didn't fail any subjects and that meant I had to go for tuition classes. For my GP and H1 econs, I went for a group tuition. The tutor actually motivated me alot, as he always made me go for classes apart from the usual time slot to make up for the fact that I could not go to school. As such, I was always constantly writing essays, developing points and arguments, writing drafts to solidify my writing skills. Outside of his classes, i hardly put in time and effort for these 2 subjects because i have already put aside time to hone my skills in the tuition centre.

For my H2 subjects: Math, Chem, Physics, I went for 1-1 tuition. They were usually in a consultation style, whereby I would have done some work and I would go through the mistakes and queries with my tutors. This would force me in such a way to do work because I knew that i had to bring something for the consult. As such, I would download papers and practice.

Initially, when I just started, I felt that I did not know almost anything. As such, I downloaded a random prelim paper online and just tried it, closed book. It didn't matter how much I scored, I just wanted to know where i was at. (I scored like 10/80 or something lol). Then i would look at my mistakes and refer to the model answers and notes to see what I needed to supplement or correct and tried to understand those concepts. This was especially useful for chemistry and physics since there was alot of knowledge that one needed to know beforehand. For those concepts that I forgot or did not understand, along with questions that I didn't know why I was wrong, I would then ask my tutors.

This carried on for about 8months ( I started studying in April). Of course, it was a very lonely route. At times, I really felt like crying and giving up. But I would tell myself that, since I already made the decision, I should just persevere through the end. A 15min morning yoga and meditation session every morning, along with the continuous playing of motivational songs also helped. I would study at the Community Centre everyday since I felt that going to a certain location to study gave me a sense of purpose. Moreover, it was usually empty since everyone was at school so there was no need to fight for seats and I could concentrate there.

Cost wise, it was definitely quite expensive to retake the exam. I would say that I am more fortunate and blessed to come from a more well-to-do family so my father was willing to support my decision and pay from his pocket. However, I know for some other private candidates, they sought tutoring from their friends or school teachers, which is less costly.

Today, I received my results. To be honest, it is not the best score (76.25RP) but I am glad that I can go for the courses I want and have a wider variety of courses to choose from. Im just relieved that I have improved and I am really grateful to all the support from my family, friends and tutors. To those of you who may not have performed as well as expected this year, it may seem like the end of the world and you feel like you are stuck in limbo but I promise you, its not. Weigh your options and decide wisely. If you feel that you could have done better, maybe retaking might be an option? For me, I feel that even if I were to time travel back to results day last year, I would have ultimately made the same choice again without any regrets. As the proverb goes, 'All roads lead to Rome'. Retaking the exam as a private candidate may not have been the easiest one, but to me, it was still a worthwhile one.

282,[JC] Coming to Victoria Junior College was the worst decision of my life.,"JC 1 here from an ""elite"" secondary school, l1r5 4 net and went to VJC as many seniors had also gone this exact same route and thought that I too could do it.
 
Other than the first few weeks of stress free orientation, I have never hated going to school more than ever. The school culture is a mix of bullshit and fake enthusiasm from the councillors as if to cover up the fucking stressful conditions that we students are subject to.

""Work hard, Play hard"" only applies to the top 20% of the cohort, for the rest of us, it is work, scoldings, tears and pain. I was never good at studying, and I only did well for Olevels by drilling and sheer luck. I knew JC was going to be tough, but this is not what i wanted.

Most tutors  favour only the ones that do well in their subjects , neglecting weaker students or even berating them for asking questions that they genuinely don’t know, even if the question isn’t very good or about a basic concept. Being a weak student without a proven studying method, everyday in school is just getting insulted and thrown around, with criticism centered around my own personality like   ""you might as well go back to secondary school"" or ""you're such a pathetic person""  when you cant answer the tutors question. In this school, your grades determine how you get treated by teachers, because ""grades=learning attitude=personality=worth as a human being ""  AND I HATE IT. 

Not going to talk about my class, as it would be too revealing, but certain toxic personalities esp this notorious ""group of 3"" make life hell as they compare everything and always make you feel like shit. 
My friend from another class also shared this same sentiment of how the IP kids ooze toxicity, and i cant agree more.   

I see my friends from secondary school having it so much better outside of this old, rotting prison with this aura of sadness and having the time, energy and the freedom to go out for lunch regularly after school. Going cafe hopping on weekends and yes they still experience stress from jc life but they have a nice learning environment, nice classmates and a community to support them.
 
I never expected my life get to this point, I thoroughly enjoyed my final years of secondary school, I was happy and now these 6 months of VJC is making me lose sight of carrying on. 

Everyday, its a constant battle to keep negative thoughts away from my mind, but recently I see fewer and fewer reasons to keep subjecting myself to this pain. 
Family is trying their best to support me in this tough time, but they can only do so much, and despite trying,  i have been conditioned to think that trying is merely not good enough. 

I dont want to be just another suicide statistic, but really whats stopping me? 

Friends? a few remaining from sec school and 0 close friends in this cutthroat environment.

Religion? Closed for 5 months and these online cell sessions do nothing.

Family? i guess it is my final stronghold, but i cant go on forever like this can i?

I guess my strongest reason is hate, because id hate to fall victim to this school.

Im sure im not alone in sharing this sentiment about the school, but what can we do?

tired, stressed, scared, but still trying. 

To all sec4s and juniors who even think about this school, just dont.

nowadays whenever i’m in school i feel like a robot. my hands move to write, my eyes blink, i inhale and exhale. physically i’m present and i’m doing what i’ve been tasked to do. but the same destructive thoughts keep replaying itself inside my head. i feel so incredibly inadequate. maybe i’m burnt out and maybe i’m just being sensitive, but i really don’t feel good in jc. destructive habits that i’ve worked so hard to get rid off has come back two-fold. it doesn’t help that my issues with trust prevents me from reaching out for help from the people around me. like i know i’m not alone, but i force myself to be alone because i feel like i don’t deserve to feel happy?  idk anymore. i just want to feel like i’m in control again. i want to feel invincible just as i’ve felt when i was a kindergartener. i want to feel happy whenever i wake up and go to school. but i’m so tired",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ias4mr/jc_im_just_tired/,True,2020-08-17 05:13:11
284,[rant] how can i get rid of this retarded teacher?,"***if you read to the end, thanks for being a cool dude***


soo basically in school, i take both physics and chemistry, and i pretty much suck at phyiscs like entire cohort, and my physics teacher comes to class every single day to persuade us to drop to combined science. 

for the past 5 years, my school has done pretty badly in physics, the principal probably scolded the physics department a lot for the bad results. which is why my teacher probably keeps asking us to drop to combined science, so that if anyone of us screws up combined science, the chemistry department can shoulder the responsibility. 

all along my school has been doing well for chemistry and i think the physics department is jealous of the limelight

if we all drop the physics subject, the department will also get whooped for failing to help us keep up with the syllabus, so he just harps on making us drop to combined science to make the chemistry department share the blame if anyone screws up

this week we have 3 surprise physics tests for no fucking reason, i think my teacher just wants to destroy our self esteem for physics so we will give in and drop to combined science to save his ass from getting whooped from the principal

im seriously fucking sick of my teacher coming in to class for the last 3 weeks just to tell us about how ""amazing"" combined science is while he just wants the chemistry department to get whooped too if we fail

he goes from showing us the syllabus to past year results to giving us tons of tests to destroy our self confidence, and i just wanna end it once and for all, can someone give suggestions on how i can fucking make this fucking trashass teacher shut up? thanks in advance

286,[A levels] My story as a private candidate + advice,"My story is unique. I used to be from ACJC. I took H2 Bio, chem, and Art with H1 math.

During my A levels in 2018, I suffered from spontaneous pneumothorax (my lung collapsed twice in 1 month) and I had to undergo surgery. I failed to complete my A levels. I only managed to complete H1 math, Art, and GP which I received my A level grades for (A, A, C respectively).

ACJC offered me a place back at school but I ended up deciding to retake my A levels as a private candidate because screw school (jkjk I liked ACJC). I chose to take the risk for a few reasons:

1. I didn't wanna wake up at 6+ anymore lol
2. I didn't wanna join a new class and batch. So awkward
3. Most importantly, I took H2 Art in JC and literally sold my soul and sacrificed my other subjects to get an A for it. I love art but the idea of having to redo my art project in 1 year was terrifying. I knew that redoing it meant that I would continue doing terribly in bio and chem.

So in order to escape H2 art, I chose to change my combi. I took up H2 math even tho I had no A math background (H1 math did help but it's pure math is damn easy. I didn't know trigo etc.). I dropped my Art to H1. ACJC wouldn't allow me to do so if I were to go back for obvious reasons so I became a private candidate.

Tbh, there were many times I regretted it because H2 math is super hard and studying alone was rly painful. Doesn't help that my chem and bio sucked and I had to catch up on them. I cried a lot before A levels LOL (didn't we all).

I ended up with 85 rank points. Got a B for H2 chem (I cried after all the papers cuz I messed up so I didn't expect an A) and a B for H2 math (which is good considering I studied it in 1 year). I got A for everything else.



My advice for anyone intending to become a private candidate:
1. It's possible to do well. Don't be disheartened
2. U have to be really self-driven. Be consistent!!! Don't waste time because 1 year isn't as long as u think. I slacked first half of the year and rly panicked nearing A levels.
3. Study with friends. I studied with juniors and friends who had gone to uni
4. Maintain a social life so u don't go crazy
5. Get tuition if necessary, especially for subjects that require essay writing. I got tuition for math, obviously. 
6. U don't necessarily need regular tuition for the whole year (it's so expensive). I got some tuition for GP and like tuition 3 sessions for Bio before A levels to clear up misconceptions/brush up on things. I also had some chem tuition cuz chem was my weakest subject. For bio, it was more like consultations for questions I've done and don't understand.
7. Be resourceful. Get notes from friends and use online resources. I found YouTube and Khan Academy videos for bio super useful to help me visualise protein structures and processes.

However, my main regret is not having a good relationship with most of my teachers cuz I need referees for uni and a lot of my school teachers don't exactly like me because I was a shitty student LOL. Didn't pay attention in class and stuff.

If you're considering whether or not to retake A levels, I urge u to think through it very clearly. It's not an easy journey. Just try for the course u want even if you're a few points short. But if u really need to retake, I hope u can keep a positive attitude while also being realistic and prepared for all the challenges you'll face, such as feeling quite alone and being very sian of studying. 

Atb to everyone and hope y'all get into the courses u want!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f84gxv/a_levels_my_story_as_a_private_candidate_advice/,True,2020-02-23 20:19:21

I'm sure there's so many of us who've worked so hard, be it for their sport, club, or performing art, and are just really bummed at the recent events. Would just like to give a shoutout to every single one of us who have went through rigorous training schedules while (trying to) balance our schoolwork and just feel lost right now. For me, I've been so looking forward to my competitions and was so excited for it to be the highlight of my last year in JC. But of course, things change and we're now stuck with this.

290,[Rant] My expectations of the education system,"This isn’t a rant but more of what I expect from the Singapore education system.

I wish that schools would tell us that we write essays to learn and improve on our language skills, at the same time learn to admire the beauty of language. Having good language skills will give us an advantage later on in life. 

I wish that they had told us this, instead of the same old reason, “You write essays to get that A1 on your report card.” 

I wish that schools taught us how to stand in the shoes of historical figures, think from their perspectives and understand why they made certain decisions. History is all already in the past, isn’t it? What’s the point of learning you may ask. Learning from the past helps us to construct a better future, at the same time we develop empathy and strong reasoning skills. 

I wish that they had told us this, instead of the same old reason, ”Just memorise all the essays to get your full marks.”

I just wish that school taught us to love the complexity of math. It isn’t just a bunch of numbers. It trains our analytically thinking skills and teaches us how to become more organised. 

I wish that they had told us this, instead of the same old reason, ”Just memorise the formulas and keep practising until you are able to get everything correct.” 

I wish that schools taught us how to improve our grades instead of simply telling us, ”Work harder next time.” 
How do we do that? How can we do that? What is the definition of ’Working harder’? 

Do we keep doing papers after papers? Questions after questions? Till midnight? 

Do we purely memorise all the chapters, only to forget everything after the exams? 

I wish that schools taught us how to become more resilient after facing a setback. We feel demoralised. We feel disappointed. We feel tired. 
And at that point of time, “No point crying over it. It’s over already” doesn’t help us at all.

The immense amount of pressure from school is all we that get. No we don’t hate school. We want to learn. But where’s the joy in learning?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jjg78g/rant_my_expectations_of_the_education_system/,True,2020-10-28 19:10:00

292,[RANT] Not too bad not too good,"Just feeling abit lost sometimes.

Being a person that’s not too bad or not too good and stuck in the middle is so frustrating.

I’m average in my study (sometimes lower than average), not much in my CCA for now but did join one.

No clear goal in life, just going with the flow mostly. Seeing many people knowing what they want to do or knowing WHAT to do just makes me feel worst. I try to do whatever I can to make me a BETTER person in study or in life but it’s always not enough.

Not sure what I really want to do after I graduate from uni (not gonna have a fantastic GPA) just doing my best.

293,"[A Levels] + O Levels notes (Physics, Chem, Math and more)","*Note: Wasn't sure if I could have two title tags for a single post, hence the weird title up there.*

(tldr my own notes for some subjects, scroll to the end for link!)

**Context:**

J3 here, I've always been a fan of making online notes (for myself) because of its convenience of not having to refer to physical notes and also how it helps me consolidate my knowledge. I was an IP student, did pretty well for all my subjects throughout school.

I started sharing my notes with just my friends by Google Drive in secondary school, and eventually as more people started using it I decided to consolidate everything into a website, put it on my IG, etc. I've gotten feedback that it's been really helpful, and while people keep telling me I should sell it, but it always felt a little weird to profit off this (and also, I was too lazy). So, inspired by another kind soul out there, I decided to just share this here!

**The subjects available:**

For O Levels / IP: Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics (we call it IM1 and IM2 but it's basically E and A respectively), Geography

For A Levels: Physics, Chemistry, Math (and contributed by others: Economics and Geography) (DM for KI)

**Some caveats also mentioned on the website, but the main points:**

* I made the notes with the intention of using it myself and not sharing. It is meant to be comprehensive BUT it may be brief over some concepts that I already understand very clearly myself.
* There might also be typos, errors, etc. If something looks fishy please check with friends, or you could drop me a DM / comment.
* I strongly suggest making your own notes! I think it's incredibly helpful as compared to merely referring to someone else's notes.

It's slightly nerve wrecking sharing notes that were wholly meant for personal use on such a large platform, but I hope this helps everyone out there studying for their exams! (Also to those who know me, please don't dox me lol.)

294,[Scholarships] General Scholarship Interview Board Advice,"As the title says. I don't cover the other aspects of scholarship selection process (too many). I assume it is an individual interview board (1 interviewee to many interviewers). My examples are heavily skewed towards scholarships offered by the civil service, but the general principles still apply to private organisations. Can also be useful for general university admission interviews too. Here goes:

&#x200B;

1. Know the scholarship organisation.

Don't go for the interview thinking that CAAS manages healthcare, or that LTA is under MSF. Go to the organisation's website and scrutinise the ""about us"" section, as well as resources on their policies. Summarise it into an easy-to-remember 5W1H about the organisation. Know what the organisation's mission and aims are, as they can be the core to your responses for difficult questions. For example, MINDEF's mission is to ""enhance Singapore's peace and security through deterrence and diplomacy"". So, if they ask you questions regarding (for example) countries who may be aggressive to us and how we may defend ourselves against them, your answer is literally there. The baseline is deterrence and diplomacy - how do you go about doing that? You just need to build on that foundation and flesh out your thoughts. Know what your organisation stands for, and be creative and flexible within that framework. Of course, this is not saying that you cannot give answers based on alternative foundations. Continuing from the above example, I may think that instead of deterrence and diplomacy, throwing money at the problem works too. However, you will need to have a damned good reason for holding that belief, and you will have to justify it on very solid grounds if you want to go that way. The most extraordinary individuals will have opinions like these.

&#x200B;

2. Be *very* familiar with the issues facing your organisation now, and in the future.

Your scholarship organisation is not looking to give you money for free. You are an investment to them, and you need to show that their investment in you will not be wasted. This means that you need to demonstrate an awareness of problems and policies, so that you can be a future leader in the organisation. I cannot stress this enough. This means you must know the following:

a. What are the problems facing this organisation now, or the problems that this organisation is looking to address?

b. What are the current solutions/policies that are in place, and their limitations?

c. What are the future/foreseeable/potential problems that this organisation will face in the future?

Parts A and B are easy. Just read the organisation's webpage, newspaper articles and other reference materials. You might need to reverse engineer policies to figure out what problem they are addressing, but those are relatively straightforward.

Part C is the most difficult. You need to read up extensively for this. Usually, policymakers will allude to problems that we will face down the road in newspaper articles or parliamentary debates. You can also have your own ideas on the potential problems that may be faced, but make sure its logical. For example, if you're going to be interviewed at MND, land use and availability is going to be a huge concern down the road (it already is now, but it'll only get worse). So, if we need more space to build, what could we do about it? We can either build further upward, or we can go underground. Or we can get more land. Dump more sand into the sea? Create more land between Tekong and the mainland? Turn Singapore's 63 islands into one huge landmass? Annex part of Malaysia? What are the pros and cons of each? Why is one solution perhaps preferred over another, in your opinion? These are the trains of thought that you will need to possess. Again, problem solving and policymaking is a key aspect of your future career, and you can bet that they will test you on this.

&#x200B;

3. Have your own opinion/stance.

What this means is, if the MFA interviewer decides to ask you whether we should support the US or China *in times of conflict*, it is probably not a good idea to say ""I think we should support both/neither"". Even though in practice, yes, we do exactly that during peacetime, the context of the question is forcing you to choose a stance. I am doubtful that they would ask the question minus ""in times of conflict"", because the standard answer during peacetime is very clear, and there's really no need to ask giveaway questions. They want to test your analytical skills, awareness of Singapore's interests, and ability to make a judgement call. You do not want to come across as someone who cannot decide, or makes bad (read: unjustifiable) decisions. Remember, you are being assessed at being a policymaker. You cannot make policy if you can't decide. Be prepared to answer follow-up questions based on your answers too. In addition, after you've committed yourself to a stance, stick to it unless you realise you've made a huge mistake. For example, if you say we should support the US because it's rules based yada yada, then don't give an answer later on that seems to suggest the opposite (eg we should support Russia because Putin is a great guy). However, if you realise you've truly f\*cked up based on the line of questioning you're getting (""why do you say Venezuela is similar to Singapore in terms of corruption?""), then you should withdraw what you've said and accept the new information given to you. It can either come across as you being open minded, or you having said something badly mistaken, depending on what you just said. Which brings me to...

&#x200B;

4. Don't smoke your way in interviews.

The panel of interviewers are career professionals. They know exactly what they are talking about. They likely know that you're trying to bluff them, and depending on how serious they are, they can question you repeatedly until it becomes clear to everyone involved that you're smoking, in which case you're done for. Don't let yourself get into this position - point 2 is key. If they ask you something that you really cannot answer, be upfront about it - I'm sorry but I am not familiar with this topic. Could you give me a background or could we discuss a different topic? If you do this once, it's probably acceptable. If you do this too many times, it means you don't know much about the organisation. Give reasonable and logical answers.

&#x200B;

5. Miscellaneous interview things

First impressions count. Even though interviews are likely to be virtual now, it's not excuse for skimping on the basics. Which means, be early. Not on time. *Early*. Dress appropriately and well. Confidence (but not braggadocio) when the interview starts. Sit up straight. Smile. Hands either clasped on the table or on your lap. No fidgeting. Minimise ums and ahs. You can see yourself on the computer screen now, use it to your advantage in addressing the above. Thank the interviewers for their time at the end. Convey a sense of gratitude that you are called for the interview. Don't be that d\*bag that treats scholarships as a god-given right to you.

When the interviewers ask you to describe yourself, give an elevator pitch (meaning 30 seconds to 1 minute, tops). Who are you, why do you want the scholarship and why you are a good fit for the organisation and vice versa. No one on the board is interested in listening to how you love trains for 5 minutes if you are interviewing at MOH. I wouldn't go so far as to say avoid saying irrelevant things about yourself, but everything you say in this pitch should have a purpose. If you really want to talk about how you have a piano diploma, it should have some link or relevance to the scholarship, else you might as well not mention it.

For personality/character questions, you should prepare for them beforehand. What are your strengths and weaknesses, most inspiring person in your life, a time when you failed and how you recovered, that kinda thing. These are easy to think about, reflect who you are as a person and you should have some idea of how you might answer these questions before the interview.

There are also some interview questions that are... interesting. I've heard of interview questions like ""if you were a tree, what would you feel?"". I have no good answer for how to answer these questions. I get the feeling that these questions are a conduit for you to express your personality/thoughts in a de-personalised way, but imo there are much better ways to ask these questions. If you get them, don't panic and don't make a fool of yourself.

You should also come across as being enthusiastic about the organisation, or at least genuinely interested in it. That can mean having a passion for the job. For example, if you're going for a teaching scholarship, how do you know that it is for you? Maybe you've taught tuition before and really enjoyed the process of giving knowledge to others. That kinda thing. But don't overdo or fake it. It's really obvious when people are doing that.

Usually, the interviewers will ask you if you have questions. It would be good to have one or two. They must not be dumb questions (""where is the headquarters of this organisation? Who's the boss? Do I get lunch breaks?""). They can be questions like, ""what is the best thing about working here? what can I look forward to as a scholar here?"" Convey a sense of curiosity and anticipation (and maybe commitment) to the organisation. It's your last chance to make a good impression.

&#x200B;

Lastly, remember that scholarships are not the end of your journey. If you get it, it's just the beginning. Don't take it for granted that you will get it, and if you do get it, treasure it and don't regret it. I'll hang around the thread to answer questions here and there, if there are any. PMs are welcome too. I'm open to opinions for improvement/criticism of this post too.

295,[O Levels] Want to motivate anyone who feels lost studying,"**Hi, I'm a Secondary 4 student who takes double pure sci + core geog. I also take amath as well. I know that many students like me are panicking about O's cause you haven't been working hard for your studies and don't know where to even start from. Don't worry! I am also going through the same thing as well.

Well, I was never a hardworking student in my life. Played League of Legends throughout PSLE exam week. Didn't even study or whatsoever, got into a decent secondary school. Did decent in lower sec until upper sec, when I started to fail subjects. Still couldn't be bothered and got L1R5 of 20 for graduating exam.

So now after reading that, you must feel bad for me right? Well maybe not, since I have gotten my result, I have worked extra hard in order to get into my dream course in NP/SP. Subjects like Amath and Chemistry that were once so hard for me became manageable only after 3 weeks of grinding papers.

Trust me, just put down your devices, go and do some work. No matter what is it, just keep on grinding, after all even if you were to do badly for your O's, you know that you have already tried your best. You have nothing to regret and can probably still do well in life. I by no means am a smart student, but I believe that hard work (and smart work) will lead to improved results. I have improved from get F9 for amath TYS to getting B4-A2 for other school papers.

Even if you feel like giving up, you could just take a few days off to play or have some rest. Throw the thought of studying out of your mind for a few days and get a good rest. The worse thing to happen 2 weeks before O's is burnout. After a few days, get back into studying. A good way to keep yourself motivated is to find some friends to study with or go back to school to study (my school is open from morning to night (7am to 9pm).

But don't let exams define you. Don't fall prey to that trap. Exams are here to assess if you have learnt a narrow range of concepts. If yes, good. If no, then time to go catch up to ensure you do better the next time.

It tests the academic side of the house.

It doesn't test your humanness and your gifts. It doesn't assess your values and your sense of justice. It doesn't show you who you are inside. So don't buy into that.

Learn to see exams as what they are. Important assessment of concepts learnt within a fixed period. That's it. Don't associate any more to it. Don't give it that power.

This doesn't mean you don't take it seriously. Of course you should give it your best shot. Work hard, study smart and shoot for the stars. But don't forget the other things like rest, nutrition, social interactions.

We are humans you know? We achieved success over millions of years of evolution. We have adapted and evolved a high functioning social and intellectual community. We can be kind, compassionate, and passionate. That's humanness.
We are not just test taking machines.

297,[O Levels] Am I at fault?,"I've just gotten back my prelim results & it isn't that great. L1r4 is 15 raw. I've put in considerable efforts for my exams & was shocked when the subject that I've put in the most effort (Chemistry) went from an A1 to B3 & other subjects didn't score as high as I've expected. Needless to say I'm pretty devastated but I've improved my poa which is considered as one of my weakest subject to a B3. I've told my mum about my results & she wasn't happy with my results, she asked if I've purposely failed my poa last year (?)
Fast forward to today, I didn't managed to study much (idk why its like nothing is in my brain) so I just decided to take a break. My older brother then decided to come to my room & started playing videos abt procrastination & laziness. When I told him to stop, he said that he'll stop once I go back to study. I think the commotion was pretty loud bc my parents went to scold me for not studying. My mum then came to my room to sleep bc my dad was sleeping in their room so she couldn't sleep thr. Um the thing is I can't rlly study bc I rlly like my own privacy plus it bothers me when thrs ppl in my room. So I told them to get out & asked my mum if she can go to my brother room to sleep. She rejected the idea telling me that she owns this house & she can do what she wants. Plus she told me that she won't disturb me. My brother started playing his videos & I asked if he could just use his earpiece as his vid is rlly loud. I'm pretty sensitive to the noises so even though I'm using my earpiece, I can still listen & my earpiece is spoilt (one side isn't working well) which made things worse. My brother also just decided to ignore me & continued watching his videos. I couldn't take it & left the room which I could hear my mum laughing with my brother, commenting smth abt me being annoyed by my brother.
I seriously couldn't take it & just cried telling them can they pls just leave my room. Which my brother told me to stop being so pampered & that he'll leave once he sees me studying. But how am I supposed to study? I then just proceeded to continue my studying while crying (Yes I'm an idiot). My dad came in & told us to stop, telling my brother to stop playing his vids or smth. While studying, both my mum & my brother (yes, they're still in my room) were talking abt me like saying that I'm rlly pampered & smth like a hopeless case.
I think in the end they both got so done with me & decided to leave. I know that after this I'll be getting scolded bc my mum will tell my teacher abt this. At this point I rlly don't know what am I supposed to do with my life & everything. I was told that I'm not allowed to go to the course that I wanted in poly & my parents wants me to go jc. But if I go jc, there will be other problems too & I don't think I'm able to handle jc.
My parents only cared abt my results not my improvement or effort put in. Am I at fault here? For like being disrespectful to my family/ selfish?
I'm sorry for such a long post, I legit feel like I'm damm useless bc I can't seem to do things right & is a waste to human society :)

Edit: Hello! I've read all of the comments & would like to thank everyone for their words of encouragement & advice. I did not expect the post to receive this much attention, unfortunately I am unable to go out as my parents aren't keen abt it & my relationship with my family have worsen  so it's pretty hard to communicate with them.

299,[Junior Colleges] Not another ~JC struggles~ post,"So, I’ve been a lurker on this sub for a pretty long time, I have considered posting before, but have managed to dissuade myself LOL. I’m finally going to do it though. Basically, after reading all the struggles faced by those in JC currently, I have decided to put in my two cents- not because i’m doing particularly well, but because I have found that I have derived a somewhat twisted sense of comfort knowing that i’m not alone in this struggle. I hope i’m not the only one HAHA. Anyway, i’m the usual relatively hardworking student that does homework, listens in class, rarely sleeps in class (I hope), and still fails (or gets unsatisfactory results relative to the amount of effort I have put in) Since my school doesn’t have blocks, it’s pretty hard for me to see where I stand, and class tests are the best gauge of my “academic performance”, of which I have failed quite a few. Although I admit I did feel a little discouraged at first, as one does when their hard work does not pay off, I have developed a sort of numbness to it. I know this is not the case for everyone, and I’m not trying to trivialise any emotion that you might feel during this period. I know it’s not easy. I simply think that sometimes we need to take a step back and see the bigger picture. Struggle is temporary. To my fellow JC kids out there, I just want to say a few things. (1.) You are NOT alone. Really. Whatever you are experiencing, there’s a chance that someone else out there is feeling the same way as well. Of course there are exceptions, and my heart really goes out to you guys. You are so strong and so capable. To the vast majority: we are in this shit together, and we will come out, stronger than before. (2.) The most cliche and overused line: exams do NOT define you. Please. If you fail an exam, it does not mean you’re dumb. It does not mean you’re not good enough. It does not mean that your friend is smarter than you. It simply means that the score you see is not half of the total score on the paper. That is all it is. A mere number. Why should we let this dictate our lives? We are placing too much emphasis on a digit that means nothing in the grand scheme of life. So what if you did not finish that math paper that you studied for the past month for? Does that automatically discredit your past efforts? No. Does that make you a more experienced person who has had a taste of failure? Yes. It is just another experience in a collection of experiences we call life. Do not let it bring you down, do not give up. You are more that just a number, you are more than your grades, you are a person. There is so much more I want to say, and so many more thoughts and emotions that I cannot express in words. I know many of you are having exams right now, and I hope that you are doing fine. If not, please seek help. I’m not sure if this will be able to help anyone out there, but I hope it will. All the best, and remember, it will be over soon, and no matter what, you do you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hj972o/junior_colleges_not_another_jc_struggles_post/,True,2020-07-02 04:25:23

301,[Rant] Our experiences in JC and some advice!,"Hello!

My friends and I have come across many posts on Reddit by JC1 / JC2 juniors who are asking for advice. As seniors, we (my friends and I shared our own experiences and decided to write this post together) have decided to share our experiences in JC with anyone who wants to read it! Just for some context: We graduated from JC last year and all of us are waiting to enter University in August this year. We are writing this post in order to help anyone who is currently experiencing difficulties while studying in JC and anyone who feels unmotivated or just struggling with issues in general. We have arranged this post in such a way that we will be discussing different aspects of our experiences in each paragraph.

**Failing in JC1**

It is very common to fail in JC1. I heard from my own juniors that JC1 is a very stressful time for them. They seem to be failing their tests and examinations very frequently (or almost all the time). Most, if not all of them are searching for study methods in order to master a subject that they are bad at. Some of them think that they are not studying hard enough even though they look like they are working themselves to death.

If you are facing the issue of failing constantly in JC1, the only advice that we would like to give you would be to not give up. Personally, I kept failing Chemistry and Math in JC1. By failing, I mean I got an U for every test and examination I went through. More often than not, I felt that I was dumber than the rest or I wasn't working as hard as others. I engaged in very unhealthy habits like sleeping at 4a.m. to study or allowing myself to wallow in unhappy thoughts. That did not help me at all. In fact, I was even more stressed and unmotivated which led to poorer results.

If you are facing what I faced, I would like you to try to help yourself today. Speak to your teachers, your family and your friends. Your teachers have taught batches and batches of students. Most of them will be willing to help you both academically and emotionally! Never give up on yourself! The reason why I managed to pick myself up would be because of the encouragement by my teacher. He would pick out the things I have improved / done well for me which would encourage me a lot because I would never ever see the things I have done well myself! When a teacher expresses his / her faith and confidence in you, somehow you will have that faith in yourself as well!

Your friends and family members are there for you! Everyone is in this together. Friends understand you the best because they have gone through many things together with you. By opening up to them, they will be able to provide another perspective to you which may even make you feel better about yourself. Most parents and family members care a lot about their children. If you have strict parents, trust me. They still care a lot about you and most want nothing but the best for you. Open up about your struggles. Show them you are struggling. My parents were very strict with me and I was always afraid to show them my results. But once, I got a U for my Chem paper and I cried out of disappointment. I legit cried like something really bad happened. My parents sat me down and we talked about what I was struggling with and my concerns. From then on, my parents were more understanding of me and spent more focus on trying to help me tide through this difficult time instead of focusing too much on results.

**Still failing in JC2**

It is still okay to fail in JC2.

Depending on your school, papers in JC2 will be harder than the actual A level papers. We believe that JC2 is a mental battle. In JC2, you would have to balance your expectations much, much better in order to prevent burnout or to prevent yourself from feeling unmotivated.

You don't have to get all As for your papers in JC2. You have to balance your expectations and know where you stand. If you are failing all your subjects in JC1, take it slow and work towards a better result. I have seen juniors praying to get As for a subject that they previously scored E/S/U for. Not saying that this is not possible, but I would like to say that they should set a smaller goal from themselves. How about set a goal like: Let's hope that I improve 1 grade or maybe 2 grades.

Again, rely on your teachers. Some of my teachers were 100% there for me when I was about to take my A levels. Our r.p. for prelims were about low 60s and one of us got a low 50s. However, there are other teachers who don't speak very well (teachers are humans too) and some told us that we were destined to not get into our desired University. One of them even told me that I wouldn't have a University to go to. Rely on the teachers that motivate you! It is important to know that **it is possible to get a good grade for A levels even if you don't do well for prelims.** It is possible but you have to put in your sweat, tears and brains.

A good grade is also very subjective ok! To me, a good grade is a grade that you have put in effort for. A grade you achieved because you persevered. A grade that you are proud of deep down inside. A grade that reflects improvement.

Do your practice papers. Approach your teachers and ask. Do it over and over and over and over again. Even if you have done that paper before, do it again. I promise you this will work. Do not ever give up. I have seen people give up and things didn't end very well for them.

If you do not give up, you will be proud of yourself regardless of your score. You will look back at your results and know you did your best.

**三百六十行，行行出状元。**

You will make it to the top if you keep up with the great attitude of not giving up.

Some teachers told me that my chem would never improve. I have never gotten above an E in school. I got an E for Chem during Prelims. They told me that they haven't seen many who jumped grade from E to A.

Guess what I got?

**Relationships in JC**

In JC, you will definitely make a lot of friends and get to know people from all walks of life. During the A-level period, it is a very stressful period for both you and your friends. Emotions can run very high and arguments could arise very easily.

During our JC2 year, we argued a lot. The four of us couldn't see eye to eye on a few matters and coupled with our frustration (due to our academics), we snapped at each other a lot. We got frustrated at one another and our attitude towards each other wasn't the best.

If there are tension between you and your friends right now, take the time to cool down. Know that friendships grow stronger through difficult times. All of you need time to calm down.

Next, take out some time to sit down as a group. Explain why you are angry (in a calm and collected manner). For us, we wrote down why we were angry on a piece of paper and read it out loud in front of each other. Sounds childish? But this is a way to allow yourself to cool down and reflect on why you are angry in the first place!

Friends are important partners in your journey in JC. Cherish your friends around you.

Another type of relationship you might experience is definitely BGR.

The three of us (the other came from a mixed-school) came from a girls school. We were definitely excited to meet people of the opposite gender. Unfortunately, our class were made up of 98% girls. (Which is a good thing also! Less drama.)

We were very excited to start a relationship in JC and I think this is where mistakes were made. As this was our first relationship, we had a lot of expectations. We invested a lot of time and emotions into this relationship. Admittedly, we were also very sensitive. This affected our studies a lot.

Personally, I only dabbled into this area right before my A levels. This was a very big mistake. We both knew that getting into a relationship wasn't the right thing to do before A levels so we stuck ourselves into the 暧昧 period. Right before the A level period, we spent very little time together because we had totally different subject combinations. He had his classes to go to (+ tuition) and I had mine to go to. We were so focused on studying that we didn't contact each other a lot.

This caused a lot of fights because during our most difficult times, we didn't know how to deal with each other. We were both very sensitive and felt like we weren't there for each other and didn't bother to make time for each other etc. etc. This made us very moody and definitely affected our efficiency. I spent quite a few days sulking around because fighting with someone you are close to really ruins your mood.

I would just like to say, if you are a very sensitive person or is someone who invests a lot of emotions into a relationship, try not to dabble into this area before  A levels. If your relationship goes wrong (touchwood), it has the potential to affect your results. It really isn't worth affecting your results.

BUT ON THE OTHER HAND:

A friend of mine got into a relationship where they would encourage each other to study. They studied together and helped each other. They motivated one another through the difficult times and helped each other academically and emotionally.

Without one another, they wouldn't be so motivated.

So I wouldn't say getting into a r/s is a no no. But definitely think twice before getting into one.

The funny thing is: None of us continued with our r/s after As. A levels really makes you sit down and evaluate your relationships :)

**Conclusion**

If you feel like you can't make it for A levels, think again. I am sure you can! Continue to work hard and don't ever give up on yourself. Make sure you are having the right study methods as well because only if you work hard in the **right direction** would you see the results you aim to get.

Thank you for reading this long af post. This was originally meant to be a blog post but the four of us decided to post it on my reddit account because I am the only one who has a reddit account HAHA.

Jiayou to all our juniors! Have a great day! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hokb7n/rant_our_experiences_in_jc_and_some_advice/,True,2020-07-10 22:59:38
302,[Rant] I care so less about A-levels that it's worrying,"A levels is in 5 months and I've been feeling so unmotivated and relaxed about it. For the past 2 months, I have done close to none of my tutorials or watched any of my lectures. I can almost see myself receiving my A level results and it doesn't look too good.

&#x200B;

Funny thing is, I wanted to come to JC. My parents and siblings told me not too and I would have a better time in poly, seeing that I already knew what I wanted to do, but I still went ahead, because I thought I enjoyed learning. I thought these 2 years would be at least slightly interesting, learning in-depth about chemistry or math, which may not be completely related to my future course but right now, I haven't even been enjoying doing physics.

&#x200B;

I literally would do anything else than study right now, and the COVID situation isn't helping me either. Anyone got any tips for me?



Edit: thanks guys for all the support and motivation, i really appreciate all your replies. I feel alot better and motivated, hopefully this motivation will last until A's.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gzcvkk/rant_i_care_so_less_about_alevels_that_its/,True,2020-06-09 17:17:57
303,[uni] rejected by all unis,"hello, i know that there may be repetitive posts but its almost 5am now and i'm so bothered that i can't sleep. i'm sorry but i really want to let it out somewhere :(

so i kind of already expected to be rejected by all the unis with my results: 61rp with a h1 S (sch didn't want to take me back and i lack discipline for priv As) but the feeling of knowing that my results really didn't show my true ability really sucks, and the fact that i was probably not offered any interviews because of my score just made me feel abit inferior.

furthermore, my family isn't well off (we qualify for financial aid) and although my mum assured me that we're able to afford a private uni (~70k for the degree i'm interested in) i know that those were all savings and could have been used for other things if i were less dumb and managed to get into a local uni.

while i do have friends in a similar predicament, they can all afford to study overseas and i know that their degree would probably be more valued than my private uni one.

this makes me feel really shitty as well but i have some friends who post stuff like ""at least a uni wants me"" or ""wow thought i got rejected"" on their story and i don't blame them at all but i do get envious + jc friends who only text me about uni applications. i mean, we are close friends but our relationship is more of a we meetup alot but dont text alot (i rarely text since i'm more of a caller) so the cb is rly making things difficult. no hate or anything but just makes me feel abit... y'know sometimes.

this is the most shallow of them all and makes me feel like utter shit, but while i was okay with studying in a private uni, the thought of having my not close friends/family etc seeing that i'm studying in a pte uni kinda bothers me, and i'm worried that it could make my parents feel ashamed when relatives/friends ask. i just want to be a kid that my parents can proudly talk about, but at this point, it doesn't seem to be possible. i mean, they've never said they were embarassed so this is more of a personal wish on my part.

lastly, i'm planning to appeal anyways, and i have friends who told me to just appeal to courses i would have a ""chance"" for, but after thinking about it, i would much rather try again for my first choice course, which is something i really want. is there perhaps something i could include so that they would at least grant me an interview? 

should i rly just do it for the uni (less cost) or what i like (probably private uni but more ex)? i would still like to experience a uni life kinda thing, like overseas exchanges and stuff as well as mingling with people my age for now.

if it helps, i applied for (very ambitious i know but its what i truly enjoy)
ot - sit

soci, econs, psych - ntu (planning to appeal soci)

soss - smu

social work - suss (hving second thoughts)

fass - nus (not gonna bother appealing)

thanks if you read till here, will try to go to sleep now :""(

edit: thank you so much for all the advice, i didnt reply to everyone but i rly feel less lost now <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gjujr1/uni_rejected_by_all_unis/,True,2020-05-15 12:38:39
304,[A Levels] Academic Burnout,"I'm so sorry, I know everyone is going through this, but I just wanted to take this down in words before it becomes too much for me.

I'm currently a J2, and I'm not scoring well in almost everything. And by this I don't mean ""I've been scoring Bs but it's not enough"" I really mean I'm FAILING in my subjects. Although I've been trying my best to study (and have been exploring a few methods despite it being so last minute) my grades never seem to improve, but everyone else is scoring just fine. I'm not academically inclined, not hardworking and not a mugger. I know I can go to poly or retake after this if I do end up screwing up A's, but I think I won't be mentally stable enough to get through that 3 years or even retake JC (and sitting for all those exams again), and my parents will never let this go.

I don't know what to do anymore. I really feel there's no joy in living because I'm just endlessly studying with no results in sight, and I'm not even studying something I enjoy. While I'm trying to be as optimistic, and have been encouraging myself to study bit by bit, time just isn't waiting for me and I keep breaking down in the middle of studying.

Good luck for A's.  


Edit: Thank you so much for the replies. Many of them made me cry, I'll read through them again to feel better when I'm not doing so well and I hope those who are having problems now feel better with all these replies too.

305,[A level] / [O level] Fast game study method,"Like some girl recently said, 50% effort better than 0%. Hell, even 1% is better than nothing. so I wanted to share how to not lose hope and study when you feel like you already lost a lot of time:

1. Start early. 
I start at 6am. May not change much, but it helps to start the momentum of doing work.

.


2. Do first, ask later. 
If you halfway do work then ask, it wastes a lot of time. Save your questions only after you finish practicing a few qns.


.

3. Simplify and understand.
Take a whole paragraph of content, internalise, and write it in layman terms. After understanding, note the keywords and proper terms, because that's what teachers look for when marking answers.


.

4. Ditch the definitions, start doing practices.
Definitions only account for a minimal amount of marks, worst come to worst: paraphrase. More importantly, you know how to do the bigger questions.


.

5. Summarise. 
No time for long-winded things to cram in your brain. Not just notes; even for practice papers and worksheets, summarise your mistakes in one page. You don't have time to flip through everything.


.

6. Take breaks.
This is to avoid a burn out. I take power naps or exercise in between study sessions to keep myself pumped and energised.


.

To my fellow peers taking national exams this year, I wish you Godspeed. It's been turbulent times, but hey, we're in this together. This is the last push already, just keep going mans.

306,[Uni] Extremely Unusual Rejection from NUS,"Long story short, I got rejected from ALL my courses (including FASS) this year with 88.75rp

I am a prospective student of NUS who reserved a course in Economics and Management at the start of this year (applied 2 years ago during NS) , but reapplied to Econs and Business Analytics with a rp of 88.75 (I believe having it as my first choice means I will apply with the full 90rp right?)

Since the double major I wanted doesn't normally require any interviews, shouldn't it be highly likely that I will be accepted, or at least given an interview? I was not only rejected from this (ik it's a highly competitive course), but also other courses I had applied to including FASS which should have a cut-off point that is much lower. I feel everything has been really unfair, it's as though they didn't bother looking at my application at all.

This is so damn weird many people I asked who knew my score didn't even believe me until I showed them my rejection letter... Is this considered to be highly unusual, and what are the chances that appeals might be successful based on what you heard before?

307,[A Levels] GP notes!,"Hello :-) I took the A levels back in 2019. I understand how broad and confusing GP can get at times due to all the articles and notes you're supposed to read. I just wanted to share with y’all some notes that helped me get an A for GP! This comprises of 2 of the 8 major GP topics, Media and Religion! The notes include general facts about the topic as well as essay outlines and model essays regarding the several sub-topics. pm me if you are interested to obtain the rest of the topics or have any questions. If not, hope these notes help you!

308,[A LEVELS] Advice for J2,"Hi, so you might know me from the O levels result release post and I feel like talking about this today because some of my friends suffered during this period. So a bit of background, I was from YIJC and graduated in 2019 with double cca, took PCMe.

Term 1-2:

* Focused on events(orientation, SYF, A divs, event planning, etc), may see grades fall which is normal, esp since H2 Math ahs vectors, H2 Chem has org chem and transition elements and H2 econs has gloabalisation and macro econs. Here is some advice I would give:

1. Buy a planner for time management and write down hw due dates, events and goals you can set on the planner. Try not to make it too rigid and adjust accordingly to changes.(e.g in case got wedding, hospital etc.) 

2. Revise J1 topics as early as you can. For GP, start memorising content ans examples. Try to take about 1h to look thru J1 topics.(For now, I guess maybe just looking thru the notes and relooking at corrections and tys, maybe even additional qns too, mostly for H2 physics and Chem in YIJC). Oh and btw, yes, it is normal to start doing Math Yearly TYS at Term 2 since most would have finished 90% of syllabus by then.

3. Start reading J2 topics before lecture. It could be on the way to school too. And even if your lecture sucks, pls dont skip lecture. Rather, do your tutorials while the lecture is going on. And do ask your tutor for any doubts durig tutorials. Always do hw.

4. CCA is important so please don't skip them unless you are sick or any valid reason. Plus they can be good for portfolio(scholarships, competitive courses and jobs) Never miss out. For events like CNY and CCA farewell, pls try not to lose out on them, especially if they involve bonding as it is your last year in JC before studying hard core for A levels. And also please never use CCA as an excuse for those doing coursework e.g. H2 Art, Music and China Studies.

5. Be healthy and exercise. For those dieting for A divs, please at least eat a light meal in school. And do try to exercise, especially for the guys who are going to do IPPT. And if you want to, go for flu vaccinations especially sicne you need to study across flu season as well.

6. Please spend June holidays wisely. I have seen people using June holidays as if it was a time to party and play Mario Kart. But be aware that you have 4 to 5 mnths at this pt for A levels in Oct and Nov.

7. PLEASE pay attention to practicals as this is the only chance that you will be using the lab. Pay attention to what to write and how to do things.

Term 3-4:

*At this point, whatever you do during this limited time will affect your A levels. No CCA but you may be called back to do CCA stuff sometimes, especially those with Exco positions. Social life may be affected and reduced but there are other who will COMPLETELY ignore the situation. 

1. For those studying at home, find a conducive space to study. It can be outside the corridors or downstairs. Please NEVER study on bed as you may be more inclined to sleep when studying. If you feel like the house is super noisy, try using earphones or earplugs if it works. Else, maybe a sleepover at someone's house may work. 

2. Addicted gamers may be affected so please do not attempt to download any NEW games.(There was a time when Mario Kart came out on Sept which was prelim period. At that time it made me realised how addicted I was.) If need to, uninstall the phone. But promise me when ai say this. NEVER NOT USE YOUR PHONE. Teachers are becoming more inclined to use technology to make things easier, especially for homework and communications so please NEVER remove your phone or at least use a seperate phone for studying purposes.

3. Should I bring an Ipad or laptop to school? Not necessarily. You can print documents out. If you are reading notes from there, it is ok. But do try to find a way to print them out to prevent anyone from losing any devices. (Again, I said not necessary but you can still bring them if you are doing hw from there and if you feel that you study effectively from there.)

4. REDUCE but NOT ELIMINATE social life. If your CCA is doing something like alumni stuff AND you can still handle studies(maybe a B), then do it. Do try to meet friends once every 2 weeks and if possible, you can make study groups(unless they disturb you a lot then nvm.) And do note that with graduation, please do not ignore this occasion as this would be your last chance to be with the people you love.

5. At Term 3 and 4, I have to warn you that you should be doing practice papers at this time. And not just DO practice papers, but also under TIMED condition. Try to set a day called ""Study notes day"" where you scan through the notes and recall from your notes to see which topics are you still horrible at. In my JC, they do give timetrials after term 4 so do try to attempt timetrials given by the JC. Also do try to study/read up your notes first before attempting the paper. And at this point, do your yearly TYS or prelim papers.

6. In terms of school,(may or may not work) if you want to adjust the timetable, try to.(Idk how to explain this but I use my experience. So during Chem class, we asked the teacher whether we could bring our chem slot(arnd 2-3pm) to lunch period(10-11am). With agreement especially from the Muslim guys in our class, our class ended on 12.30 on fridays instead of 3pm.(MAY OR MAY NOT WORK). Also for consultations, do book them IN ADVANCE and PREPARE for the consultations as tutors still have the authority to decline a consultation if you do not prepare anything. If you dont know what to prep, create qns that you can ask the tutor.(Why am I not allowed to say ""XXX""? Can I write it in another way? I don't udnerstand why I cannot say ""XXX"", Is my working wrong? So far I know how to do this working but I dont know where to continue on from there. Am I allowed to use this format? etc). If you feel that you think ""your tutor is useless""(not saying they are), my opinion is just try out first. And if that still does not work, try consulting another tutor and consult with a friend under that tutor. It can be useful. If not, try asking a ""smart"" friend for help as well.

7. Do try to study for practical for H2 Science students as they contribute 20% of the score.

8. Find out what is your study method. Do not insult other people methods of studying as not everyone has the same studying style and environment. 

Few days before A levels:

1. At this point this is where I recommend compiling your corrections as you can reread the corrections again and understand what went wrong. Please do not attempt too much prelim papers without marking. 

2. Eat healthily, to prevent yourself from an upset stomach. Exercise but dont overexercise, to prevent strains or cramps or dislocation from affecting you.

3. Figure out what topics you are missing or weak at and cover the gaps. Read through your notes again(There was one time I reread my Physics notes in which I realised a topic that I did not study (Momentum of Photon calculation.) Luckily studied it and it came out during physics application question about gravitational holes lol. 

4. Identify which resources are missing that your require. French curve? Ruler? Graphing calculator? E dictionary? Most important, do try to print out your entry proof(NOT THE RECEIPT) as this can help you be able to find the stuff you need(unless you rather buy a $1 copy from GO). Most importantly ensure that you have entry proof, NRIC and FILLED PENS(looking at you humanities papers and GP.)

5. Know when your papers occur and for those having scholarships, check out whether APPLICATION DUE DATE occurs before end of A levels.(SUTD early admission.)

During A levels:

1. Come to school early and know your exam venue. At least an hour. Dry and calm yourself. Please do not dye your hair. And turn mobile to silent. Ensure all pockets(esp jacket) do not contain any information relevant to exam. Tissues are fine. Do bring a jacket due to air con. And most importanly, listen to the instructions of the invigilator. 

2. In any case that something makes you uncomfortable or fearful (e.g. calculator spoil, nose bleed, water spillage.) Do inform the invigilator as immediately as possible. They are there to at least ensure things are fair. Don't be nervous when asking for fulscap immediately.

3. Never give up. I have seen a student sleep during exam before he gave up on H2 Math. That should not mean you should give up. EVEN IF you screwed up a previous relevant paper, it could be a minor mistake which makes you lose a few marks. Esp for GP for essay  and Math which require working. Never lose because of a mistake you made. 

4. Eat something that does not cause gastric pains in stomach. I recommend water and a sandwich or at least something for morning papers.

That is all I have to say about A levels for J2s. I wish you all the best and hope that covid does not affect how you study.

P.s. any seniors for A levels, I recommend commenting down below on any other advice.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ksjad2/a_levels_advice_for_j2/,True,2021-01-08 10:27:52
309,[rant] o-levels and failing mental health,"i really wish there was an option to put my studies on hold while i work on my mental health. this year has been absolute shit. i was diagnosed with depression and anxiety and started taking medicine for it but the motivation never seemed to come back. the guilt of not studying eats me alive but i can’t bring myself to do it. ik i’ve came here many times to ask for advice but really, none of it seems to work. it’s getting really tough to even do basic things like showering daily. the fact that i once was the “gifted kid” that did well and studied hard burdens me as well. after getting top 10% and top 25% of cohort, how did i fall into such a deep well where most of my subjects are a b3 and a b4. i prided myself on my grades, they were the only thing that made me feel like i was worth smtg. but now that they’re just mediocre, i feel like there’s no point. aiming for an L1R4 of 10 seems like a dream that i can never achieve. not to mention i see all my friends mugging like siao, it makes me feel even shittier abt myself. smtimes i wish i didn’t have to go through this. i really hate it. maybe i’m just being lazy and blaming it on my depression. i don’t know anymore. at one point i was so close to committing not alive but my friends reached out to me and stopped me. i’m grateful for them really, but this time... i don’t know.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j92txp/rant_olevels_and_failing_mental_health/,True,2020-10-12 02:01:15
310,[Uni] [Rant] Snakes,"Anyone have any snake experiences to share? Let’s have a thread to vent about all these two faced cunning backstabbers.

For me personally, recently came across this person who lied to a friend to gain access to a private resources dump for our course (you know, seniors’ past exam solutions, extra material and notes, that kind of thing). They granted themselves all permissions, then downloaded it to their computer and removed a large chunk of the content from the main resource drive (and emptied the recycle bin too). When confronted, they proceed to lie about not having edit access even though their name is recorded in the activity log as deleting folders and files. To make matters worse, they refused to upload back all the material that was deleted. My friend and the owner of the private drive had to spend hours and days to try and restore the deleted content. To make matters worse, searched this person up on LinkedIn and turns out to be a diploma with merit from their poly.

312,[Rant] Literature isn't useless either!,"After reading the post on History being a useful subject, I thought I'd also defend literature's utility as an 'A'/'O' level subject. Although lit's a more popular arts subject at secondary school and JC, it's still pretty underrated when compared to Geog and History (at O's) and Econs (at A's). Having chosen literature though, I'll say that it's not only very applicable but also extremely rewarding.  

To start off, I'll give a bit of background as to what lit students learn. At the exams, two parts are tested: a part on a book and a part on a previously unseen piece of writing. Lit students have to use what they've learned about the book for the first part, while the second part requires them to analyse and interpret the given piece.  

How is this useful???  

For one, it teaches you to actually think critically. Unlike GP and SS, whose texts are centred around what YOU think about the text, lit is all about what the AUTHOR thinks. You need to think and close-read what a lit text says much much much more than in other humans subjects. Every word, turn-of-phrase, syllable and sentence has a meaning, and your job is to decipher it. Lit gives you a second sight when reading, allowing you to read not only what the text says, but also what the *author's* motivations and drives are.

Besides that, literary works say something deep about LIFE. Characters and tropes aren't just literary devices — they're part of the real world. Surely you know someone who excels in many ways but as a result of a certain personality trait fails terribly (tragic hero and fatal flaw). If econs lets you learn about large-scale behaviour, lit lets you learn about individual behaviour. 

There are also a number of other benefits: the ability to appreciate ambiguity and subjectivity, a larger general knowledge, an ability to appreciate art better. But even if lit wasn't useful, it's a really fun subject. Just ask any lit student and they'll tell you likewise!

313,[O Levels] Compilation of my personal tips and tricks for Chinese Paper 1 and Paper 2,"**Paper 1:**
INFORMAL EMAIL
Highlight the questions and think through whether or not you know how to answer before starting

**Paragraph 1**

你好！是否别来无恙？我写这封电邮的目的是。。。
Get straight to the point. No need for flowery language if you're struggling.

**Paragraph 2**

Answer the first question with 3 points because that paragraph for answer the first question will always be 3marks. If it were to have a format, it might be: 立场，理由 1, 理由 2。
Edit:Use WHO format to state your points. (What, How, Outcome. Details in P4-5)

**Paragraph 3**

过渡段 is basically to make your email sound more fluent instead of suddenly changing topics to answer the second question. Maybe think of the sentence in English and try translate it to Chinese.

**Paragraph 4-5**
Answer the second question be it giving your opinion or suggesting something. You can follow the WHO format:
**What** are your views/suggesting?+reason
**How** do you think it affects/help?+examples
**Outcome** of the problem/suggestion? 
If your Chinese jialat like mine, you can shove in 2 points in 1 paragraph without examples. For answering this question, maximum you can get is 4m so to play really safe throw in 4 points. If it were me, i would write 2 points in paragraph 4 and the other 2 in paragraph 5

**Paragraph 6**

我就写到这里了。希望早日受到你的电邮。 
No need for anything else. Don't risk your language mark >.>

FORMAL EMAIL
Highlight what is wants and decide whether or not you know what to write before starting

**Paragraph 1**

您好,我是一名 (identity, doesn't require your name). 
State your complaint/Give your opinions on some event
The goal of the email. Usually is to give suggestions

**Paragraph 2**

Describe your complaint/Describe your experience (at the event)
Give 2 reasons why you're complaining/2 main reasons why you like the event(not sure about this, someone correct me)
This paragraph is worth maximum 3 marks

**Paragraph 3**

过度句 same as in informal but in more formal language

**Paragraph 4-5**
Suggestions part. Follow WHO format again:
**What** do you suggest?+reason
**How** would you implement?+examples
**Outcome** of the suggestion.

**Paragraph 6**

素问您从善如流，办事效率高，愿请您采纳我的建议。谢谢。
Rmb to sign off your name with a 启


**ESSAY**
Q3: Very likely to be narrative. Note the moral that you are supposed to get in the experience. Also note whether or not to write in first person or write about a friend.

Q4: Discursive question. Pretty similar if not exactly the same as the ones in English. You can just copy paste the question with rephrasing/add ons here and there for intro paragraph. The body paragraph is up to you to write. Maybe you can follow PEEL format.

Q5: 材料作文 my expertise lmao. Copy and paste the entire 材料 for the intro and add in one line to fluently lead to your first point and so on. TAKE NOTE OF 谈谈 OR 记叙. If you don't, you're going to lose a lot of marks for writing out of point. If you don't understand what you are supposed to write about, DO NOT WRITE THIS. You're only going to lose marks for writing out of point. Trust me, I've been there lul and failed a practice question.
If you're like me, die die want to write this, go read the 材料作文 book for ideas. Or you can read a whole bunch of news and pray that you remember them/it actually comes out.

**Paper 2**

综合填空. It's also my weakness, usually get 5-7 marks, 2 if it's hard, 8 if it's incredibly easy for me. This one no choice have to remember the words that you were taught. Or, you can eliminate the words that don't make sense. Stare at the words that you know and guess the meaning and either eliminate it or choose it. If you really can't do it, it's fine, move on. There are more marks to get. Somone advised to just skip studying for this. You can do that it's just 10m unless you're aiming high :P

Edit: Skip if you usually spend a long time on this. Not worth to risk several marks for the sake of this meager 10m. Come back later if there's time

**阅读理解 1**

Highlight what the question wants and stare at the passage. It's also good to stare at all the options and eliminate those that are not mentioned or implied in the text. For news like images, the first paragraph is your best friend, it's basically the summary of the text. As for the skills to pick, too bad. Go revise & recognise the skills!!! Aim for at least 16 here.

**阅读理解 2**

For questions generally asking the actions/words of the author/character, COPY THE SENTENCE(S). Of course, rephrase it such that it makes sense and connects with other points which are spread throughout the text.

Explanation questions: Break down the sentence they want you to explain and rephrase that sentence. Otherwise, read the text above and below what they want you to define.
Credits to all those that have answered me in the comments <3 

Moral of the story questions: Put yourself into the author's shoes. This one no choice but to really think about what the moral is, what you think of it and give examples.

Author personality questions: State the personality, what did he do in general and provide the specific examples in the text.
Credits to u/failureuwu123 for suggesting this to me :)

Last qns types: PEEL strategy. Not much i can state here without the text. It's entirely up to your interpretations.

Lastly, remember to bring your NRIC/EzLink card+Entry Proof! Good luck everyone!!!

314,[META] Basic Savings Account and Finance 101,"Hi all, I thought that I would take some time off to write a short post about personal finance and saving accounts for those who do not know much about this. I personally think that financial literacy is something that ought to be covered properly in school but sadly it isn't.

**Why am I doing this?**

* I think at this age, especially the demographic of this subreddit, where most are 16-25 years old, you might have a lump sum of money from NS, bursaries or scholarships. I have seen alot of my friends splurging these money or even buying insurance that they do not need. There are many better ways to make better use of this money at almost zero risk.
* Also, alot of your friends perhaps are selling insurance and might pressure you into buying from them. I hope that from this short write up, you will learn that ALOT of these insurance are things that you will not need, and all you are doing from buying these insurance is feeding your ""friends"" there commissions.

**Who am I?**

* Just would like to make a small disclaimer, I am a 20 odd years old dude studying in one of the local university. My major has NOTHING to do with finance but finance has been a small little interest of mine and I tend to spend too much time reading things about it. Started off with cryptocurrencies a few years back and somehow got burned from it and now dabbling abit into stocks market. But I am not going to teach you about equities, bonds and cryptocurrencies because these are way beyond the scope of what I plan to share.

**Part 1: Basic Savings Account**

* I am pretty sure most, if not all of you own a ""DBS Black Visa Card"" or ""POSB Blue Card"" and if you actually pay attention, you should realise that these savings account pays a measly rate of 0.05% interest per annum, which doesn't even cover inflation. Pretty sure, you guy know what inflation is and I don't have to elaborate on this.

""Huh, liddat how, how to beat inflation or minimise the risk of inflation?""

* There's actually a few products out there that are of zero risk and they are:

|~~Standard Chartered Jumpstart Account 2% Interest on your first 20k~~ [~~https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/jumpstart/~~](https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/jumpstart/)  With this dropping to 1% i/r from 1 July onwards, it's no longer the best option|~~Note that the interest rate will soon be cut to 1% from July onwards. This is actually a savings account for young adults from 18 to 26 years old. They also provide a Mastercard with 1% rebate on online and offline spends.~~|
|:-|:-|
|DashEasy Earn by Singtel & Etiqa 2% per annum Insurance Saving Plan|Works similar to Singlife 2.5% interest rate. The catch is that they charge $0.70 per withdrawal and withdrawal has to be minimum of $100 and in multiples of $100. Min amount is $2,000 to earn 2% per annum and max is $20,000. It has also come to my attention that there's a clause in it that says that Singtel reserves the right to hold your withdrawal for a period of up to 6 months. So take note on that.|
|Singlife 2.5% Interest Life Insurance Account (up to 10k) [https://app.singlife.com/92sfGZj0s8](https://app.singlife.com/92sfGZj0s8) (for $10, access via your mobile)|""Eh you sot ah just now tell me dont buy insurance now you share insurance?"" Actually Singlife is a new SME Fintech that focus on revolutionising the insurance scene. Basically this account double up as a savings account.|
|~~Stashaway Simple Money Market Funds - Projected 1.9%~~ [~~https://www.stashaway.sg/simple~~](https://www.stashaway.sg/simple) Would be 1.4% from Sept onwards|~~Stashaway is a robo advisor app, and they have this fairly new product that brings your money into money market funds. If you don't know what it is, just do a quick google. It's almost risk free. Via stashaway risk management algorithm, there's a 99% chance that you will not lose more than 1.7% of your deposit.~~|

**""Wah so what's the risk?""**

* For Standard Charted it is insured under SDIC for up to $75,000.
* Singlife & Singtel Dash EasyEarn is covered under SDIC PPF.
* For Stashaway Money Market Fund, the risk is as stated, 99% chance that you will not lose more than 1.7% of your deposit but note that the turnover is longer about 2 to 3 days for withdrawal.
* All are licensed by MAS so no worries.
* Also the interest are all compounded daily and paid out either daily or monthly. Singlife pays out monthly (say you made an account today, your interest pay out will be on 5th Jul but amount is compounded daily). Standard Chartered pay out the interest at the first day of each month. Stashaway Money Market pays out daily.

**""So Korkor can tl;dr me?""**

* So what I am doing now is - First 10k (Singlife 2.5%), next 20k (~~Standard Chartered 2%~~ Singtel & Etiqa 2%), ~~remaining cash (Stashaway Simple)~~

**Part 2: Why Should You Not Buy Endowment or Life Insurance**

* This might annoy some insurance agent or student advisors, whatever you call yourself so please skip if you are one and might easily get affected by what I am going to say. I repeat, this might rub you off in the wrong way but I am bringing this for the awareness of the greater public.

**""Too good to be true""**

* A few weeks back I receive this text message from a friend, please share with me what you think.

>so basically this is like insurance related thing la so you need to pass a few tests la so there will be 4 mcq tests 2x 50qn and 2x 100qn tests that you have to pass. the test fees and everything will b paid for so dunnid to worry if you fail and you can keep retaking until you pass. even if the test fees incurred exceeds 500$ ok which i will explain in abit so the only catch is that you’ll need to deposit 500$ but this $500 is to prevent people from backing out la after the company sort of like ‘invest’ in them so if you back out, the 500$ will be forfeited and i think you’ll need to pay for all the test fees as well. but once you pass everything the 500$ will be given back to you. so you really don’t lose anything really. then once everything’s done and dusted, you’ll be sort of like attached to an insurance company as sort of like a side job under them then they’ll pay you 1000 every month for 24 months lo and you won’t even have to do anything. and there will be a contract to bind everything tgt so dunnid to worry it’s not legit and stuff  
>  
>basically the whole idea why the deal is so good is that these big insurance companies they need a certain number of people in their company to be able to go after certain big scale projects and they can’t just falsify these numbers cause they go through stringent checks through MAS so cause of that they need to have actual people who are qualified to be under their company so that they can get these projects la so by doing the tests and everything which they’re paying for you you’ll be doing them like a ‘favour’ sort of and in return they pay you every month just by being a non active ‘number’ in their company

* What I personally think is that they are trying to get as many student advisors as possible into their group, so that they can get these student advisors to either recruit more friends, or sell the products to their friends - because insurance companies basically work like a pyramid scheme (pardon for a lack of better terms)

**So what's so bad about insurance?**

* Insurance agents love to sell you plans like Investment Linked Product (ILP), Endowment Plans, Life Insurance because these plans pay extremely high. Few agents would sell you things that you need aka Health Insurance because such plans usually don't pay well.
* Insurance also do not declare their commission to their customers most of the time, but they should because that's the law.

[https://preview.redd.it/75orsojnb4351.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bdf7d844dd4f6c447a05a0b7556dd03cbe2f5a8](https://preview.redd.it/75orsojnb4351.png?width=749&format=png&auto=webp&s=9bdf7d844dd4f6c447a05a0b7556dd03cbe2f5a8)

* As you can see, a big portion of your premium goes to their pocket. Imagine buying a ILP and paying 45% fees in the first year. Thats immediately sitting on a 45% loss on your investment.
* Alot of insurance agents like to repackage it in such a way to get you to ""invest early because of power of compounding"" but there are better options like buying ETFs directly. This is not the main point of my writing today but if you are keen please do read up more.

**""I am keen on learning more! Where can I learn more!""**

* Seedly in general is a very good platform and there are many well knowledge people there. They also have a FB group if you are keen to join, it's called Seedly Personal Finance.

**Closing Words**

* I hope that this brings a little awareness to savings plan in general, not sure how many of you had already known of this beforehand. But if you find it helpful, please share it to your other friends.
* Or perhaps, when you earn your first interest, make a small donation or buy a meal to the uncles or aunties who are selling tissue paper in the coffee shop you are eating in.
* If any of you are keen on knowing more or have anything that you would like me to expand on more, depending on the response, I might find some time to write more.

**tl;dr - use better savings account, screw insurance except health insurance**

Edit: I've mentioned above that insurance agents are to declare their commission. I looked it up online and it's under MAS Regulation 306 of 1996, insurance agents have to disclose their fees. So next time if you are stopped by one on the MRT or any of your ""friends"" approach you, please bear this in mind. By knowing the commission structure, you might be able to have a clearer idea on why that particular product is sold to you.

**Why do I dislike ILPs/Endowment and is there any alternative?**

>I agree, but I am personally not a big fan of ILPs and endowments because of the large COMMISSION fees. My parents have fell prey to this when I was younger and I have seen many people's parents fell prey to it, because they do not know better. There are better opportunities like ETF into a big index or roboadvisors than feeding the insurance agents who simply disappear after you put your signature on the line. Funny thing is alot of these agents are selling products that they themselves do not even own, which I find it very ironic. Also, unfortunately most of the endowment plans come with ""NON-GUARANTEED"" returns but agents often sell them as a ""ALMOST guaranteed"" returns. I looked at my old endowment/life plans before I cashed out (after 20+ years), I lost money after inflation has been factored.  
>  
>But no doubt, health insurance is definitely a must get. I would even strongly advice everyone to upgrade to the highest tier of coverage at our age because it only gets more expensive and more difficult to upgrade.  
>  
>Hopefully, FinTech insurance company will deem the traditional insurance company obsolete and bring in more product with lower fees. It just does not make financial sense especially for ILPs to take a 45% loss of your first year investment. Many people I know who bought UTs from 3 years back are still bleeding despite the massive bull run because of the fees.

**Edit 2: One last parting sentence that I like - ""No one cares more about your money than you"". So think carefully before deciding on any products that you buy, especially financial products. Because often time people sell you products with a vested interest.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gx7v2x/meta_basic_savings_account_and_finance_101/,True,2020-06-06 08:31:58

In sec sch, same situation but i continued running after throwing up. What do i do? Btw, Im underweight & perhaps malnourished.

316,[O levels] My weird O level motivation,"I know O levels are over but I thought this may still be relevant.

Many students are often motivated by a prize from their parents for good results, happiness, the 2 month holiday and a good post secondary education. For me however, I am motivated or otherwise FUELED by REDEMPTION, FRUSTRATION AND ANGER.

 I had a bad PSLE score. I thought I was going to Express but ended up in Normal Academic. I usually always compared myself to the bottom thinking to myself “Hey at least I am not last"" to be optimistic or something. But after I entered secondary school, I always compared myself to the top. If I am the top in class I would work to be top in the nearby classes. If I am the top in the nearby classes I would work to be the top in level. This helped me transfer from normal academic to express.

After I went to Secondary 3(Pure double Science), I started failing my subjects again. I was at a very bad point in my life, self harm and basically feeling very miserable. I studied my worries away until I got the hang of one subject, then 2 , then 4 and until I could pass every subject. Then I aimed to go pass 60%, then 70% and aimed to receive a 9 for L1R5(After CCA points) and a 7 for L1R4(After CCA points).

Then the dreaded O level came. My PTSD of my horrible PSLE score came up when the secondary 4 students were watching the previous batch receiving their results. We had to leave before they collected their results, we were only there to see the cohort performance and the top 10 students. My brain immediately fired up and I wanted to study everyday until I die for some reason.

During O levels I was studying 6+ hours a day and only stopping to take a piss, take a shit or eat and shower. I had never felt this motivated before and I was not happy at all. I was feeling like shit and constantly had a headache. But I never actually burned out and kept going.

Let me tell you how different it feels when you are motivated by redemption where the redemption is getting a good result after the previous shit one. You wake up and you immediately feel like you were wasting time and just remember all the crying after the PSLE results were released and also remember the hell you went through in secondary 2 and 3 to get here. You would study and feel the knowledge going in and you try to focus and put your brain to 200%.

Now I am having my holidays but the motivation is still there. I want to study for no fucking reason and I somehow lost interest in gaming. I now wake up everyday and watch youtube and go back to sleep. I feel like shit and feel like I should be doing something. I feel absolutely miserable and tired. Can any seniors tell me what to do?

[Edit]: I am thinking of going to Cybersecurity/Infocomm Security for Poly and Temasek JC Science stream. I started looking at JC 1 stuff and started learning python and OMG I feel alive. I feel like I'm doing something and not wasting my time. Thank you all",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jyymio/o_levels_my_weird_o_level_motivation/,True,2020-11-23 08:40:00
317,[O Levels] Coping with Stress and Anxiety.,"I am a Secondary 4 taking the O Levels in a few days, but the stress is truly getting to me.

I’ve always been self motivated, and I motivate myself to study by putting stress on myself. My parents, close friends and teachers seldom have to push or drive me to work, but I think this has really backfired on me these past few weeks.

I did well in my Prelims, a raw 7 in my L1R5, but I can’t shake off the doubts that it was a fluke, and I would end up with a raw score of >15, which absolutely terrifies me. 

The worst part about all this is that the stress stems from me. I can’t stop asking myself to work harder, and I always feel horribly guilty and awful every moment I don’t study. 

Unfortunately no one around me can really help with these issues, and I know that only I can help myself here.

However, I just wanted to ask this community for help, and for anyone in a similar predicament to share their experiences and how they got through them.

Thank you!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jbfbo8/o_levels_coping_with_stress_and_anxiety/,True,2020-10-15 18:43:26

In class, I do know someone who is like me but i have a feeling that he has friends elsewhere. Does that leave me. Abit of background, i used to have friends back in secondary but now they have all went to JC. HBL also made this worst. 
Ive heard that many like me made friends through common interest in reddit. I am sort of into cardistry and was wondering if anyone wanted to meet up?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hz8f2h/poly_no_friends/,True,2020-07-28 20:56:49

320,[Rant] feeling very uncomfortable in school,"Hey guys, I am writing this because I have to get something off my chest today. Starting this year, I got admitted into X Secondary School and life has been great so far. I'm not doing too badly in my studies and my teachers are always helpful. But I always fear one thing when I go to school. The girls.

You see, the girls have a very 'weird' taste in anime. They absolutely love anime, but the NSFW kind. They would always talk about it in school and how (NSFW trigger) cum is clear, or how big a penis should be. At first, it didn't bother me that much, but that was when they began to show it to others.

During recess, I was just playing CodM with my friends when suddenly the girls started approaching us. I didn't even know they were approaching when one of them said, (NSFW trigger) ""you want to hear the (moaning) sounds of a boy or a girl?"" I understood what she meant and asked her to go away, but proceeded to play the audio. I thought it would end one day, but I was wrong.

EVERY. SINGLE. TIME. I play with my friends, they come up to us and play the audio to all my friends who were playing. Distracting me from my gameplay is another matter, it just feels super uncomfortable having to hear the audio everyday even when I try to avoid them. But then it got worse.

So today, we went to the science lab and waited outside for the teacher to come. But suddenly, the girls who were always in front of us slowly started to move behind us. I ignored and just continued chatting with my friend when I heard one of them say, (NSFW trigger) ""Who do you think has a bigger ass?"" I heard them say it, but I didn't know how to react. I didn't know if I should be offended or play it off as a joke. At the time, I just ignored them, but it has been on my mind for a few hours. I fear that this will only get worse but I will have to see what happens. I hate that people think that girls are allowed to stare at our private areas without permission and still be allowed, but boys are unable to ( which i also believe, but girls should not be able to too). and when sometimes girls kick our balls our some shit, they play it off as a joke but when we ACCIDENTALLY hit their chest while fooling around, im suddenly a pervert. am I in the wrong?

TL;DR girls watched hentai, played hentai audio to us, then started sexually harassing (?) ( im sorry if im using this word wrong) us.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i4rep7/rant_feeling_very_uncomfortable_in_school/,True,2020-08-07 05:02:19

322,"[Junior Colleges] To the VJC community, jiayou!!","I was inclined to write this post after seeing Education Minister Mr Ong Ye Kung's IG post on people discriminating against VJC students just because one teacher got the virus.

Just want to tell you guys, this is not your fault. This is not the teacher's fault, and this is not the fault of whoever spread it to your teacher either. This is not anybody's fault. Those people who refuse to sit next to you on the bus, those people who refuse to serve you food, they do not deserve your attention. The vast majority of us are rooting for you guys every step of the way.

324,"[JC] Graduates, do you miss your junior college?","Here's some 6AM contemplation for y'all. (If sentences aren't coherent, I just pulled an all nighter so you know why) As a fresh graduate from JC in a time of quarantine, I've come to reminisce about my JC life more often. THIS THREAD is peppered with kiasu, wholesome but ultimately, more often than not, VERY STRESSED OUT people. (ie. very, very intelligent people who unwittingly make the less intelligent feel sorry for ourselves... it's in no way your fault tho! Maybe some of y'all had a jumpstart but it remains that yall are amazing and hardworking folks! There are also others who are freaking out about how to study and what to do with a lack of reply from universities :( For y'all, it will be okay! Have hope in yourselves because there are so many different opportunities life will give you:)) Reading this thread kinda made me feel VERY freaked out about the prospect of uni where it's HANDS OFF, you've gotta study really hard to get to where you wanna go and it's a whole new ballgame in general. It really made me feel very very grateful for my JC experience, where (this is just my experience) the teachers are incredibly supportive and they really want to help you succeed. There are wonderful friendships that have been forged and memories made. It is not to say that it wasn't stressful, but it was worth it. Honestly I'd love to go to JC again (maybe,,,, without so many tests lmao) but yeah! Even PW (the bane of my existence) was very enlightening and my groupmates made the whole experience (while there was a fair share of making each other annoyed) very fulfilling and a fun journey! It's the little things that you remember, laughing at funny things (maybe at your teacher's expense), RUSHING to complete homework together and getting through tough periods of time together with people you care about. Its about supporting your friends at competitions or performances and feeling that sense of immense pride for them. There's so many wonderful things to look back on. 

This however, usually breezes past when you're actually in JC, sLuGgiNg away at the endless heaps of assignments, being part of the ""DESU club"" and feeling the constant burden of 'help A LEVELS EJDYGEFIUE"". I think, once I got outta JC, I gained a much greater appreciation and sense of gratitude for the opportunity to be in such an environment - for the friendships made and memories shared. 

To the graduates who are reading this, it doesn't matter what JC/poly you're from, do share fun times here too!(If you want) To current students who are struggling, don't give up hope and press on! Always remember to make good memories :"") 

To all, ""Oh, the Places You'll Go!""

This post references an earlier post about researching what your major is actually about (the one about chemical engineering having just about nothing to do with actual chemistry and food science not actually being that much of food science et cetera).

As a J2 who has just finished A Levels a couple of days ago, I thought that it would be really useful if we could collate advice from seniors about their major - what people think it is, and what it actually is like to study for it.

Was your major what you expected it to be? Do you have any regrets? What did you wish you knew before you submitted your university application?

328,[A Levels] How I jumped from 28.75 to 73.75 rp from Prelims to As,"Alright, I wasn't going to post this tbch, but after seeing quite a few posts of people sharing their own wholesome success stories, I decided I'm gonna share mine. For those who do recognise this, please dm me to confirm my identity and not ask me in the thread thanks:).

Alright, context here. I scored okay for O Levels, and was set on Poly, but due to weird choices made on my own part and partially due to parental and peer pressure, I caved in and joined the A Level route. However, after appealing everywhere, and I literally mean EVERYWHERE, I was offered only XJC. Literally everyone, upon finding out that I only had 1 option left for JC, advised me against it and told me that it would only be a dead end to go to there. However, after thinking about it, I told myself to view A Levels as a redemption ticket, to prove to everyone that  XJC wasn't going to be a choice that I regretted in the future.

Fast forward one year, I'd cleared promos with relative ease (CDE/CD), but for some reason, in j2, I was finding it extremely difficult.

H2 Chem: Chemistry has always been my weakest link, even at Os. I once had an amazingly bad score in secondary school, scoring less than 20% for the EOYs. However, under the guidance of my teachers and tuition teachers, I had scraped a B3. However, As were a different matter altogether. The depth of content was wayyyyyyy deeper than annything at O Level, and I was definitely unprepared. Even for promos, I literally had no idea what I was doing, and had NO idea how I passed that exam. However, for Organic Chem, I literally got bombarded with information that I had no idea what to do with. I  constantly felt like I was in a dark hole, with no one able to rescue me.

H2 Math: I did okay for J1 promos, where I managed  a high C. However, when vectors came, I literally was like WTF. I  was struggling for months, and it hit a turning point when I was so frustrated that I took my anger out on a friend that was trying to teach me the subject (I apologised ofc.) But for months, even up till May/June, I'd say I was still so lost and clueless, I would want to just give up.

H2 Econs: Did I mention that I never passed any Econs papers apart from Promos all the way till As?

For MYEs, I recorded an absolutely stunning UUU/CD, which got a direct ticket to a parent-teacher meeting for yours truly. My parents were asking if I was even trying, which led to quite a few nights of self-doubt and isolation in my room, wondering what I could even do to remedy the situation. It got bad to the extent that I didn't go to school for almost an entire week, which led to my clique pm-ing me to check that I was fine. (I am very grateful for them.) However, I somehow kept the belief that if I kept going, just somehow kept going, I'd see something at prelims.

So prelims was looming, and I had begun to throw myself into revision for about 10-12 hours a day. I would endlessly look at my 100+ OChem reactions, even drawing them out at least for 1 hour a day to give myself no chance of forgetting anything. I'd do literally anything to give myself a chance at improvement. Feeling distracted? Move from home to study at public libraries. Tempted to game? Limit game time to just mealtimes and toilet breaks. These helped to keep me sane as I studied, and were definitely valuable times just to forget about the hell I was in for a short while.

Prelims came and went, and I was rewarded...with failures for all H2s. SUU/CC. By this point, I was definitely panicking, and seeing all my friends around me with Ds and Cs for many of their H2s definitely did not make me feel better. I felt horrible, thinking all my hard work was going to be for nothing. But I remembered the pact that I made at the start of j1: Don't give up on yourself, and prove that XJC wasn't a waste of your time. 

So, I doubled my efforts. I made sure I did 2-3 weekly timed essays, and 1 timed case for Econs every week. I did timed practices for math and chem, and my TYS looked almost unrecognisable by the end of it. I went for every consult I could for my h2 subjects. My friends were definitely my largest pillar of support. I studied alone for almost the entire prelim and As period, but I knew I could count on them being just a call away when I needed someone to talk to :).

Results day came, and all I was hoping for was a score good enough to enter any university course locally. However, I was literally shocked when I got my results.

BCD/AA B(pw)

H2 econs: I never really hated econs, but it seemed like I was just awful at the subject. However, I somehow kept telling myself that if I kept at it, somehow the Cambridge examiners would be more lenient and I'll be okay at As. Somehow emerged out of there with a fucking B. OMFG.

H2 Chem: the reason I probably hated my jc life a lot more than I would've. I hated chem; never understood it, never liked it. Took it mainly to appease my family as they wanted me to do science. When I got that D, even though it may seem like a shitty grade to many, I was just so elated that all the practice and endless reinforcement of key chem terms paid off.

H2 Math: I would make sure I did math every day, even in J1. However, for every major jc exam, I kept fucking up the paper, ending up with a U / S. I felt horrible after Paper 1, when I realised I probably only got 3 full questions right. However, I told myself to stop dwelling on everything, and focus  on stats. True enough, I found the stats paper wayyyyyyy more manageable, and I think that pulled me to a C.

Well, for all those reading this (if u even made it this far into my incoherent rambling), keep the faith. JC is meant to be crazy and hellish, and not everything is gonna be plain sailing. I was in school till 8pm to 9pm for most CCA days (EXCO) but I promise you things get a lot less crazy during the mugging period. And talk to your friends! Use the time to bond and talk, even if it's just a short 20 min heart to heart during recess.

330,[Scholarships] Incomplete Guide to Financial Assistance & Bursaries,"Hello! Recently I helped my PR-turned-SC relatives on FAS for their children and thought that maybe this info can help others too.

FAS vary across different schools and education levels, and I am most familiar with primary, secondary and jc applications. Bursaries vary across different districts, so dates, types of bursaries and application process will differ too. So make sure to confirm with your institute/Community Club/RC the exact details. Especially after Covid, some criteria have been adjusted, and organizations are more generous with assistance.

Also, most FAS and bursaries are applicable only for Singapore Citizens. PRs and foreign students unfortunately may not find this useful, but I will do my best to research!

\~\~\~\~\~

b. nationality

c. others

II.  a general Application Process

III. School/MOE FAS

IV. Edusave Bursaries

V. Neighbourhood Bursaries

VI. Organizations

a. CDAC

b. SINDA

c. Others

VII. Other family assistance

a. NEU PC PLUS PROGRAMME

\~\~\~\~\~

I. Eligibility Criteria

a. Most government and school bursaries and FAS just need your income. Here's an example:

""Gross Monthly Household Income (GHI) ≤$2,750 or

Monthly Household Per Capita Income (PCI) ≤ $690""

GHI is the total monthly income earned by everyone in your family. Some ask to include NSMen salary and part time students, etc. PCI is when you divide GHI/(the number of people in your household). So if you have disabled/elderly/young children in your house, then you have a smaller PCI and will be more eligible for FAS.

b. like I mentioned, only Singapore Citizens will be eligible for most FAS and bursaries. I will elaborate more in specific FAS below.

c. Some organizations (religious, racial) prioritize their target group, and will ask for your personal information, such as birth country, race, language spoken, religion, etc. Some organizations do not prioritize any target group, but will ask for all these anyways, so don't be caught off guard.

Some FAS will ask you if you have applied for other schemes. You will not be eligible for some bursaries if you are already in another scheme. But I encourage you to apply for every bursary because you can get multiple in a year.

\~\~\~\~\~

II. I will tell you what most FAS applications require, what documents to prepare and where to get them. This is a step-by-step guide with pictures.

MOE states that they want 12 months of your history, not a fixed year. So if you are applying now on 27 Nov, then select Nov 2019 to Nov 2020. Just to be safe I always include 1 month earlier. Select 'View' and a softcopy of your history will be downloaded. Print this out. Do the same for your contribution history, as well as all working people in your family.

Honestly, if you have a part-time student sibling that contributes irregular cpf, then just write them as 'part time student' and not 'employed' and do not include their cpf. unless they check their cpf they wouldnt say anything.

If your parents are more comfortable with going to the cpf center to ask counter that's fine too.

* For b the Tax Notice of Assessment I'm not exactly sure how to get that, sorry!

But a tip, your self-employed members should declare their cpf to be as exact and reflective of their intended income. The only way for gov to check your income is to use cpf calculator from your declared cpf, so if you want them to see that your income does not exceed a certain amount, declare an appropriate amount okay. A few times my parents declare just $100 over for a month for fun and I cant get FAS.

* for d,

1. take pictures of the front and back of your ic as clear and as bright as possible, without any light reflection on your ic.
2. crop and combine them to be in the same paper to save space if you want
3. download camscanner
4. select the picture(s) from your gallery, and save as pdf.
5. now you can print the pdf or go bookshop print.

I keep softcopies of all my family members to print whenever I need.

* for f, bursaries and scholarships usually require your latest result slips. so use camscanner to make a nice pdf to print too.

so now you have

1. a filled application form
2. NRIC of all your family members
3. contribution and transaction history fo your family's cpf
4. other documents

Staple them together, check properly and submit to general office/CC. Let them look through for mistakes. If you need to correct something, they will ask you to correct and sign.

\~\~\~\~\~

III. School FAS

There is MOE FAS and other FAS in case you do not meet MOE FAS criteria.

For MOE FAS, apply as soon as you can at the start of the year. Ask general office for the application form, and ask for other bursaries they offer. google 'MOE FAS form' and you can download the softcopy online.

My secondary school used to advertise to us schemes from external organizations like salesmen and that's how I find so many. My JC offered me CDAC bursary when I fail to meet MOE FAS criteria. They also had their own scholarships that you can apply for, and FAS students dont need to pay for expensive books and can loan graphic calculators. So make sure to ask!

\~\~\~\~\~

IV. MOE offer many bursaries for different education levels and institutes. A quick google search(gov website [https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/awards-scholarships/edusave-awards/](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/fees-assistance-awards-scholarships/awards-scholarships/edusave-awards/) ) and you see that there are many types of bursaries.

Website says MOE will tell you if you are eligible. So they are asking you to wait until end of school year to see your results and determine if you are eligible. Your schools should have already inform you of EAGLES and Good Progress Awards. But to elaborate,

&#x200B;

[see ugly red circle. MOE will have your information from when you have applied successfully for MOE FAS](https://preview.redd.it/tdsonp9ctr161.jpg?width=778&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=841281cfa616959a9a7c04bccd884984001e39a4)

\~\~\~\~\~

V. Neighbourhood Bursaries

I call it neighbourhood because I have no idea what these are called. They really vary from region to region. It's hard to find information online, so best to ask your nearest CC/RC. Make sure that you go to your neighburhood's assigned CC. If unsure, just ask counter and tell them where to get bursary form and they will direct you.

Chronologically over the years, my region Cheng San have CCC-CDC Education Merit Award, edusave Scholarship award, Cheng San Seletar-CCC Bursary award that they just send letters to me to tell me if I am eligible or not. They usually send you around Nov and Dec.

\~\~\~\~\~

VI. Organizations

Some schools advertise many external organizations and their offered scholarships, some schools do not. Here are some I have found, but make sure to do a thorough search online and ask your school!

a. CDAC

https://preview.redd.it/gb8z7g7itr161.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=2268a591fc55bce9d4dd6f0397806679e81a5b12

&#x200B;

[YEAP Grant is one of those bursaries where they look at your race and nationality. You must be a Chinese SC and must be nominated by your school.](https://preview.redd.it/ufohbsmjtr161.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=d31d6600a7000a2eb88edcfeca23b3fd3247db29)

&#x200B;

Also check under 'Supporting families' -> 'CDAC Ready For School Project'. The website doesnt have much info.

&#x200B;

During Covid this year, they have given out more vouchers too.

Just explore around the website to see what they offer.

&#x200B;

b. SINDA

SINDA provides afterschool childcare subsidies, bursaries, among many things. There are many different criteria as well, so check well!

[other schemes, such as school pocket money fund, looks at your housing type, number of siblings, etc](https://preview.redd.it/cl1liw5otr161.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b8bb538f81b429b7bedb085641d07e82c0a02f4)

&#x200B;

c. Others

Some religious organizations will provide scholarships and bursaries for specific courses, such as NAFA, or specialized university courses.

&#x200B;

[SMU - SCs and PRs can apply](https://preview.redd.it/ey31d3yrtr161.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ae6151f447b3aecc4522c6d78248de7e5496565)

&#x200B;

[NAFA - specialized courses have scholarships offered by associations that want to promote their culture and arts](https://preview.redd.it/itr6etrttr161.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=bbdbfd0828e7f69720247900946f612d7d97d91a)

&#x200B;

\~\~\~\~\~

VII. Other financial assistance

[https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/neu-pc-plus](https://www.imda.gov.sg/programme-listing/neu-pc-plus) NEU PC PLUS PROGRAMME from IMDA allows students who meet the criteria to be eligible for certain laptop models, broadband services, etc at discounted prices. I have seen many organisations (CDAC, SINDA, MOE FAS) that include this option in their FAS and website as well.

the website includes different application processes for MOE FAS recipients, and many other forms for fibre broadband services and subsidy types.

\~\~\~\~\~

I can try to answer any questions you have!

If you spot any mistakes please dont hesitate to correct me and I will edit/add on!

I also want to apologize for sending this out right after many bursary applications close. I realize I did this too late, but I also had exams. And better late than never right?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k1zs9q/scholarships_incomplete_guide_to_financial/,True,2020-11-28 03:51:21
331,"[rant] people, who perform ‘better’, ranting = rude/insensitive?","Before I say anything, you can candidly disagree with my point of view but please be civil.

I just saw this comment thread which made me think about a lot of things including my own situation. As I mentioned in my previous post here, my friend group is extremely competitive and is made up of highly intelligent people - the kinds of students that teachers absolutely love and favour and think highly of. Imagine you’re one of them, but you’re the black sheep and at the bottom of the friend group. You perform more or less the worst among them, and although people think you’re smart or that you’re above average, you still feel worthless everyday because you perform worse than your friends? That’s what happens to a lot of us, but when we complain about it, people label us as being insensitive because there are people who are performing worse than us.

I get that life is not all about academics and bad results don’t define you etc etc but irl, it is hard to believe these and even if you do, it is hard to actually feel this way. Especially when you’re pressured every single day to be on top of everything and reminded that if you perform just a little worse than your elite-student counterparts, you’re worthless. Let’s say in an 80-mark paper, your peers complain about losing 5-6 marks, talking as if it was the biggest disappointment in their lives. You, who lost 10-15 marks, know that you did relatively well compared to about 70% of your classmates, but you still feel insecure because your friends only lost 5-6 marks. (Don’t come in here with ‘it’s just how you perceive it’, we all know not everyone is able to remain ever so positive.) Let’s say you get an A1 but with 75.3%, and your teacher slowly shakes her head saying you need to work harder, and that you can drop to an A2 any moment. How would you feel in the future?

I just had the same experience as the owner of the comment thread I saw. After discussing the physics paper 1 with my friends, I realised I lost 6/7 marks. I was thinking, well maybe it isn’t that bad. But simultaneously, several notifications of text messages from my friends popped up on my phone screen saying ‘damn sia I lost 2 marks alrd’ or ‘shit cher is gonna be so disappointed aft seeing my results, I lost 3 marks lol’. I panicked in an instant, repeatedly questioning my own self worth and having the recurring thought that I am and will always be the stupid friend in my friend group. If you come from a similar background, you’ll know what I’m talking about and how it feels. 

Maybe it is rude to be complaining about the fact that you lost 6 marks in a group of people who lost 10 marks, in a discussion specifically made for people who lost 10 marks to complain, like a person complaining about life at a funeral. But students with similar situations don’t have anywhere else to open up about their feelings, so they approach forums like discussion threads for certain papers to express how they feel, but end up getting called out for being rude and insensitive instead. “You should be thankful instead” is easier said than felt. They’re too insecure to talk about it to their friends, and too scared to complain to their teachers or families, but also get rejected by what’s supposed to be a safe place. What happens next is this education system producing individuals with severe inferiority complexes. 

I get that being insensitive isn’t about feeling that way but saying it out loud in front of people who performed worse. But saying it in a  discussion thread is considered rude? Not only on Reddit but also irl when people talk about how they lost marks that are somewhat less than the marks an average student would lose, they’re just cut off with “shut up, I lost more marks than you”. You automatically become the asshole rubbing your victory in other people’s faces. I don’t know how to sufficiently explain but I just find it a bit ridiculous.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jqpy1v/rant_people_who_perform_better_ranting/,True,2020-11-09 19:23:04

334,[Poly] From Terrible O levels to Course Medalist AMA,"I was considering whether to do an AMA for the longest time, especially with COVID-19 affecting lessons and CCAs. So... Since I am free, here I am.

Most probably, some of you may have seen my comments on numerous posts regarding Scholarships and University applications. Some of you may even know who I am. Regardless, I shall give a small summary of myself before you hit me with questions regarding Scholarships, Polytechnic Life (can't exactly help with curriculum since unfortunately, I am not exactly a programmer) or Uni applications.

**Past**

I was massively bullied in secondary school, which resulted in my low self-esteem (and skipping school 80-90% of the time.) Thanks to MOE, I managed to get transferred out to complete my O levels at the expense of additional 1 more year. As expected from a person without much secondary school knowledge, I did really badly but managed to get into Computer Engineering. (I chose DCPE out of practicality since (i) Smart Nation, and (ii) people say engineering can jump ship lol)

**Polytechnic**

One lecturer believed in me despite my past and supported my growth throughout SP. Long story short, for those who are curious about my portfolio (since I received PMs on how I managed to get into quite a number of interviews):

1. Led a Student-Led Initiative to found my own CCA
2. Was involved in a total of 9 events organizing committees
3. Represented my school for a minister presentation and YMAC
4. Gotten the CSIT Diploma Scholarship to fund my 3 years (which I am really grateful for) and went to intern with them for 22 weeks
5. And yes, gotten course medalist and top graduate, among other awards at my final year

**Future**

I have accepted SUTD Global Distinguished Scholarship, with the intention to go ESD. I rejected SMU Computing and Law and NTU Data Science and AI. I am also trying my luck to apply for an overseas university. (Sorry US, since collegeboard doesn't have an available SAT slot for me, I shall look at UK only :<)

I just want to leave one important advice here: Do not let society's assumed indicators of future successes determine what you are. Always believe in yourself and do the right thing; one day, you'll see yourself at the pinnacle with the rest of your peers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gx0q17/poly_from_terrible_o_levels_to_course_medalist_ama/,True,2020-06-06 00:33:19

336,[JC] Inferiority complex,"hello,, so I'm a J1 this year and I went to an IP JC and honestly, I feel so out-of-place compared to all the other students there... The IP students there are so much smarter than me and it is so apparent whenever we attend lectures... I try my best to listen and absorb all the information I can and still have no idea what the hell is going on while they could easily understand what the lecturer was teaching even though the pace was super fast... And it's not like the IP students look down on me for entering through JAE, in fact they've been very welcoming and I can tell they are trying their best to minimise the IP-JAE segregation, but how do I just overcome this overwhelming fear of being judged for not being as smart ? That said , I've thoroughly enjoyed my few days in the new environment and I'm super grateful to have been accepted here , it's just that my self-esteem issues are constantly working against me and hindering me from opening up and make new friends... :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f1792d/jc_inferiority_complex/,True,2020-02-10 03:02:26

338,O level to US Uni [O level],"Hello! 

As the title indicates, this post will be about the O level-US uni pathway post I will be making. I took O levels last year and am currently a freshman (taking online classes from Singapore) Please upvote so that more people can see this. Feel free to comment down below too if there is anything else I missed/anything you would like me to talk about :> I apologise for taking so long with it (been busy after my finals)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**University**

*Name*: University of Illinois, Chicago

*Ranking* (QS): 231

*Major*: [Electrical Engineering](https://catalog.uic.edu/ucat/colleges-depts/engineering/ece/bs-ee/)

*Program*: [Academic Accelarator Program (AAP)](https://global.uic.edu/undergraduate/admission-aap/) (2 semesters/ freshmen year)

O level students go into AAP, A level students go into International Direct (ID), There isn't much difference between ID and AAP. AAP just has to take some workshops and is not allowed to choose classes for the first year. There are criterias to complete AAP (2.5 GPA normally, 2.75 GPA for engineering) (completion of ENGL 160) 

&#x200B;

I chose UIC cause of the location (downtown chicago) and the ranking. Chicago's public transport isn't that bad and UIC's ranking is pretty decent (in my opinion) 

&#x200B;

**Scores**

*O level*: Above 15 points (3.3 GPA)

*SAT (recommended)*: 1320 (English: 620, Math: 700) 

I studied in 2 weeks from scratch. Not a lot of new concepts involved, just need to get used to the way the exam works. [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat) is enough I think. I used The Princeton Review Cracking the SAT from popular (NOT the premium edition), but it was expensive and not really necessary, just do all the full-length practices from Khan (there's 10 i think) and you'll be fine

SAT is optional but take it if you can (if u don't want to take SATs, u will take ITEP (free) )  Aim for a 630 for English so that u can get credit for ENGL 160, SAT essay is not necessary for UIC

&#x200B;

**Finances** (USD) 

*Tuition fees per year* (2 full-time sems) (as of 2020): $33,000

*Health insurance*: $2,000

*Scholarship*: $9,000 per year

Highest I have heard of is $13,000

*Final Total*: $26,000

&#x200B;

[*Housing*](http://uic.wpengine.com/undergraduate/admission-housing/):

Housing is only necessary for Freshmen students. I got a waiver for it before COVID cause I will be staying with a family friend and my mom will be coming with me for the first 4-6 months. 

&#x200B;

**Degree Info**

*Duration*: Typically 4 years 

*How it works*: 

Most people complete their degree in 4 years (8 semesters). There are 3 semesters in a year (Spring, Summer, Fall). Summer (12 weeks) is a short semester so its not considered full-time. Fall and Spring (full-time sems) (16 weeks each) are compulsory semesters for international students, Summer isn't. Most students take one or two classes in the Summer while doing internships.

Engineering degrees need 128 credit hours for graduation. In one full-time sem, u can take a min of 12 credits and a max of 18 credits (more than 18, department approval is needed)

&#x200B;

**Online classes experiences**: 

Ey ya gurl got a 4.0 with 18 credits!!! so I'm super happy about that :> Timezones can be a bitch tho, My sleep schedule in Fall 2020 was 3.30am to 11.30am. 3 out of 5 of my classes were asynchronous so my classes start and end timings varied daily. It was more assignments than exams and my god there are so so soo picky about citations it was annoying to get used to. But overall, it was good. I had friends who helped me with some subjects and I had helped them with others. 

Google docs is absolutely amazing. I love the document outline especially, I can just click to where I wanna go instead of scrolling up and down. The UIC email has 4TB of storage space too.

There are a lot of good online resources (slide templates, citation machines, math checkers etc...) . textbooks are very expensive lmao but there are sites where u can get them for free ;) (not all tho) (I'm willing to pass down my textbooks and notes too, if we have the same classes)

&#x200B;

**Advantages over A level** (Personal opinion): 

You get to skip 2 years!! which I think is a massive bonus. most schools that accept O levels are not that high in ranking yes, but u can transfer to the school of your choice later in sophomore or junior year or take masters there. 

&#x200B;

**Difference from Singapore**: (comparing to my experience from O level)

You are on your own. They will just tell you (this) and (this) exists. It's on you to read up on yourself. It's on you to find your own opportunities. Planning!! is super important cause you're supposed to chose your own classes (after AAP), u need to make sure you take the necessary classes in order so that you can move forward to your next classes (Most classes have pre-requisites classes you need to fulfill to take that class). And the fees are damn expensive so need to make sure to not take an extra semester

&#x200B;

Uni requires more consistent work (homework, midterms, weekly quizzes all count toward the final GPA), and about 2 new concepts are taught every week for all the subjects so yea consistent work VS Singapore where you just cram for one final national exam 

&#x200B;

Honestly I didn't work that hard for O levels (was also dealing with mental health and family stuff), But uni is like a whole different ball game ynoe? like its uni!!! I'm not the type that works hard for the sake of it lol which is why I didn't feel motivated in O levels, I didn't have a goal to work towards. But uni is sort of the final milestone (kinda) already so yea its either do or die (I also want more scholarships)

Edit: removed agent's info cause was not allowed 

Thank you for the award! Please do feel free to pm if u all have any private questions and do update me if anyone do decide to go to UIC :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kgqti1/o_level_to_us_uni_o_level/,True,2020-12-21 00:48:24
339,[JC] Comprehensive tips to score an A in General Paper,"Hello guys! I am a JC graduate who took my As last year. I know there are many posts here with tips on how to score well for GP but I noticed that there's still a lot of people asking for help and advice on the subject. So as someone who struggled with English in secondary school, I would like to share with you some tips that has helped me get an A in GP A Levels. If you guys have any further questions or would like some tutoring, feel free to pm me! :)

For GP, the skills required are generally the same as secondary school English. It is just that you have to write more convincingly; creatively; concisely. You have to get your logic right.

For Paper 1 essays, there is the language part and the content part.

For language, it is not so much about bombastic words but its about using words that flow. Playing around with sentences is a must. Try searching for **different sentence structures** and practice using them in your essays (don’t force them in, however; they must feel natural). **Vary your sentence lengths**. You can use long sentences to write your thesis, give an example or just explain a concept, but don’t let them run-on like you don’t know when and where to stop, they become so infuriating to read and will get you nothing but ugly red marks all over your paper, and a big fat D. So make it short; impactful.

**Use signposting**. Because that is how you can link ideas - the ultra most important work to do in your essay. Even if you forget your catchy words or phrases, using simple language and linking your ideas will still do the trick and get you your A.

**Play with punctuation**. Commas and full stops are so damn boring. Sprinkle a dash of colons and semicolons and dashes and all those beautiful things.

Don’t use idioms - it makes you sound like a primary school student writing fiction, unless you do it right. Most importantly, do not ever use words like “don’t” or “it’s”. **Contractions** are like the forbidden fruit that everyone wants a taste of, but is so poisonous it will end up killing you (or your grades, in this case).

Arm yourself with **writing techniques** such as alliteration, amplification, analogy, anaphora, antithesis, ayndeton, parellelism, repetition and rule of three. These really make your essay more stylistic but as said before, if you do not do these IT IS OKAY. What is important is that you do not lose track of your content and the linking of ideas.

Know when to **stop** your paragraph. People want to read words, not vomit. Enough said.

So TLDR;

1. Treat words and punctuation like frosting. Use enough of it so that your cake has a nice tasty layer but not too much that it becomes nauseating.
2. Don’t forget about the cake. Content is what you get points for.
3. String and weave together ideas like a tailor. Use signposting to do that.

For content,

Read newspapers everyday. Try to read **newspapers that represent both sides of the political spectrum**. So if you read the New York Times or BBC, try to read Fox News or Wall Street Journal too so that you get the viewpoint of different political groups. Also, never forget about Singapore news! You can read Straits Times for that. Alternatively, if you really do not like to read newspapers, spend just 10 minutes a day watching the news on your TV (CNA/Vasantham/Other Mediacorp Channels). It really pays off. If you really can’t be bothered to read the news, at least **read other essays**. They are the best help in terms of teaching you to build your own arguments. Also, other than world issues, try to find out about **issues that have occured in local schools**, such as special occurrences during your National School Games. You can use these examples for your AQ in Paper 2 to answer “in your society/in your age group” questions.

Also, **take an interest** in what you’re reading. Hence, you won’t feel burdened having to read the news everyday. In my case, I’ve always been interested in the issue of Gender and Politics so I would read them without having any daily reminders or compulsion. Therefore, writing essays became really easy for me as I was truly passionate about what I was writing and I had enough content knowledge on the tip of my fingers too!

Being **passionate** about what you’re writing helps with not just your content but also your language. When you feel strongly about something, your personal voice shows in your essay. It is a very strong armament to have in your writing closet as this is one of the few things that differentiates the best writers from the good ones. So engage in impassioned writing!

Also, try to create google docs for each GP topic and write down your arguments, key facts and other notes there. During A Level period, this will become your best exam resource and you don’t have to open 200 tabs to read different articles!

And most importantly, before you write your essay, plan what points you’re going to write! Try to organise the points in order of importance and if you struggle to come up with points you can come up with frameworks like SPERM, PMI, SWOT, SING, Long/Short term. You can view the following website to learn more about these. 
https://www.google.com.sg/amp/s/msfaithgoh.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/five-brainstorming-techniques/amp/

Also, using mental models for GP is a very useful tip to generate content, I’ll be posting about it soon! 

For Paper 2,

**Paraphrase, paraphrase, paraphrase.** I cannot more highly stress the importance of it. Try to paraphrase everything you read (the parts that are needed for the answer) and don’t leave anything out. Also, remember that paraphrasing is not just about using **synonyms**!!! This is also where your **sentence structuring** skills come into play. When you paraphrase, do not just replace the lifted word with another. Sometimes, it might still be considered lifting if you do not substitute the words properly. *In fact, simply substituting is called patchwriting and is considered a form of plagiarism.* Therefore, change the order of the words to make it even more different. Change the **voice of the sentences** too - from an active to a passive voice or vice versa. For example, let's take this sentence to paraphrase: “We have quickened the pace of lives only to become less patient”. In our first try, we can probably come up with, “We have sped up the momentum of our lives just to end up restless”. Is this good? Definitely. Can we do better? Of course. We can say, “Restlessness ended up as the result of our speeding-up of society”. This sentence does not only carry any lifted words, but also still carries the implication of the original sentence - the irony of not having improved our lives at all. (We thought speeding up our society would be good, but instead of enjoying the fruits of our labour, our mindset just became conditioned to expecting more in a lesser time. So we are not happier or better off after all). Doing the above will waste about an extra few seconds of your time, but trust me - you cannot be more thankful of the effect this exercise will have on your grades.

Other than paraphrasing, your **understanding of different question types** and how to answer them is key in scoring an A. Furthermore, you need to be able to **pick out writing techniques** like the use of irony, hyperbole, personification and explain how it is used in the passage and their implications. For these, plenty of practice is important.

Of course, there is the AQ part in Paper 2. My key advice here would be this - learn to **critique whatever you read**. Just because a column was written in *the New York Times* does not make it fully accurate or exempt from bias. Practice reading articles from such publications and picking apart their arguments so that you can do the same in your AQ. Learn about different **logical fallacies** so that you can critique even better. Try to pick out all the key ideas in your reading passages and underline them so that you can choose the best one to write about. With sufficient practice, you can analyse whether what the author says is fully accurate or applicable in your society. Furthermore, use the tips from above. Read or watch **local news.** Practice all the skills you would need to write a proper essay. Because the combination to score AQ is this: **Evaluation + Balance**. Learning to critique articles improves your ability to analyse and evaluate while improving your essay skills will help you write a balanced AQ.

Note: Balance DOES NOT mean one OPV and one SPV paragraph. It means writing paragraphs that give enough weight to opposing viewpoints. You can write 2 paragraphs supporting your stand but you must still show the opposing argument in each paragraph. Also, make sure to not construct a strawman argument for your OPV. Don’t be a coward. Pick out the good ideas of your OPV and be bold enough to try and knock it down. You’ll only win an A that way.

So these are my tips for GP. If you guys have any more questions, need GP notes, want someone to critique your essays or give a crash course, feel free to pm me! Hope this helps :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g76hkl/jc_comprehensive_tips_to_score_an_a_in_general/,True,2020-04-25 03:05:41

341,"[O-levels] Its never too late, till you say it is","To all the sec 4s receiving your results tomorrow,

For those of you that have done well, congrats! Take it in your stride and continue to work hard, even as you continue into tertiary education, JC, poly or ITE whichever. Maybe go read up on educational pathways/ scholarships/ programs; its good to start planning early.

For those of you who are disappointed with your results, its never too late, till you say it is. Sure, it may suck to have fucked up your Os; you're gonna feel like shit for a long time; regret everything you've done, or rather what you've not done. Feeling like shit won't change the grades on your results slip. Pragmatically speaking, there's absolutely nothing you can do to change what has happened, other than to keep your head up and look forward to the future. You may have lost this battle, but the war is not lost.

&#x200B;

Do not despair.

In any case, worrying won't help at this point in time (yea its easier said than done). Your certs have already been printed; your grades set in stone. Take rest of tonight (and tomorrow morning) to party and go crazy cause you'll never have this chance again.

344,4 Simple Proven Steps to START Studying GP ESSAY! [A LEVELS],"Hi friends! I am finally back after a short hiatus. I hope i am still in time to share some tips with you for GP, for your upcoming tests! As usual, [the full post is here](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/how-to-start-studying-for-general-paper-essay/) if you want to read some details and also enjoy my memes :) Today i would like to share some simple steps i personally found really helpful when i was starting out my preparation for GP Essays!

It's now March, regardless of whether you're in J1 or J2, you **still have a lot of time to make a difference** in your GP journey. Start by aiming to do well for the upcoming common test!

Did you know that GP is one of the subjects with the **lowest national percentages of A** at around 22-25% while most other subjects are above 30% or even above 40%? That means that in the whole Singapore, only about 1/4 or 1/5 of the cohort would receive an A :(

Does that mean it is an extremely challenging subject? Yes and No. Yes because **it is difficult and confusing if you just jump into the subject** and hope to do well. No because **it is actually intuitive and straightforward the moment you understand how to study** for the subject. GP seems very broad, so if you don't have a targeted strategy you may struggle with it quite a bit. The good news is **GP is really much easier when you understand what needs to be done** and I am here to share that with you :)

Here are **4 simple steps to START studying for GP Essay** (Paper 1) even if you're absolutely clueless at the moment:

## 1. Choose a theme that interests you

There are many themes out there in GP but you have to be strategic about it! **Choose from those themes that are more major.** By major, i mean that they come out for A Levels nearly every year and sometimes even have 2 questions in a year. The themes i personally find important are: **Science & Tech | Arts | Media | Politics | Environment | Social Issues.** One other themes you can focus on is ""In your society"" questions, which means you specialise in all knowledge of Singapore no matter in what aspects (be it our work dynamics, green spaces, food culture, city living, diversity, crime & punishment, tech advancements, politics and foreign policy etc). [**Check out this article**](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/7-major-topics-for-gp-essays-compiled-past-year-prelim-a-levels-essay-questions/) if you need some more information about the various themes!

**Pro Tip: Pick something from the major themes!**

I stress **finding a theme that you LIKE**. Legit, there will definitely be at least ONE theme that interest you. Liking that theme is very important because it gives you the **motivation to find out more** about that theme.

You may be wondering what about other themes like education, sports, crime, fashion, poverty? Well i think of these topics as **fringe topics that are not as major** as the abovementioned ones simply because they **do not come out as often**. Some of them like education is also particularly challenging and requires a highly nuanced response. So i would recommend picking from the major themes. You **should pick at least two themes to work on**, but for starters go with one first and dive deeper into it.

## 2. Look at what questions there are for that theme

The next thing to do is to **look at the potential questions that are being asked** for that theme. I always encourage students/peers/friends to look at questions because it gives a very succinct and comprehensive overview of what that topic entails. Imagine if you just dive into Science and Tech, you would probably Google that and read what comes up but that becomes a little inefficient since the scope of the topic is virtually endless. Conversely, **looking at questions evinces the key topics and concerns** surrounding that theme. Once again, you can check out the article i wrote previously to see what types of questions there are.

**Pro Tip: Spot the trends across different questions!**

Note that **questions can be similar.** Don't be overwhelmed by the large number of questions. Instead, seek to **spot some trends among the pool of questions** to see which ones are similar and relate to the same key concern.

## 3. Read some essays or articles to build content

Once you have identified the key theme and some key issues of that theme, you can **proceed to build your content!** It's kinda like playing Pokemon where you have to train your Pokemon and expose them to outside gym battles. Similarly, you have to **take time to accumulate your own content pool** about this topic. The **earlier you start, the more solid your content knowledge** will be!

**Pro Tip: Get content from reading essays!**

**Model essays are powerful tools** because in one essay, it's **packed with so many arguments and examples**. Check out [**some model essays here**](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/essay/)**!** The point here is not for you to memorise these essays, but to learn from them. I really mean this, because if you memorise and regurgitate, it may only work if the exact same question comes out. If the question is different even slightly, you would be **failing to answer the question and simply spamming content in your essay.** From essays, **extract the arguments and examples**. After that, you could really **spend some time thinking about what you just read**, how you feel about it, and how it relates to your own opinion. **Actively digesting and evaluating** what you read is important to train your critical thinking skills and help **develop your personal voice** (the X factor that differentiates A-grade essays in the exams).

## 4. Start writing some paragraphs and get feedback!

After all the reading, you **need to try writing** **and answering the questions!**

This is really crucial because you can **only improve when you try** and you can **only truly understand when you apply**. From all the questions that you have seen, pick one and it's time to show what you have got! It's like going for gym battles with your Pokemon! **If you are defeated, don't lose heart, simply get feedback** and work on it.

**Feedback is extremely important for improvement** because otherwise you will just keep repeating the same mistakes. Practice doesn't make perfect, **effective practice makes perfect**. You have to make tweaks to your own writing every time you practice. Seek consultations with teachers or tutors. Remember, it is very important to have someone give you comments on your work and writing and also provide concrete steps that outline how you can improve.

**Pro Tip: You don't have to write an entire essay to practice! You can simply write just one paragraph and that's good enough for you to try and apply what you have read and learned**

If you have read this far, kudos to you to taking a step in improving your GP :) The next step is to **try out these 4 simple steps!** It will surely take time but the sooner you start the easier it gets. I know of many students who wait till 1-2 months before exams before really revising or going for tuition. Honestly, that is not as effective because as you would have noticed by now, GP is a subject that takes time to improve. So go out there and ace GP essays with these steps!

**Stay tuned for Part 2 that will be posted a few weeks from now** where we will look at another 4 simple steps for studying Compre (Paper 2)! :) And yes, if you are surprised Compre can be studied for, it can!

345,[A levels] Wuhan Virus in VJC,"apologies if this is the wrong thread, but just had to let this out...

&#x200B;

there are already 33 confirmed cases of this novel-Coronavirus islandwide. and to my greatest fear, one of these cases just had to be in my school (VJC). in light of this, why hasn’t MOE started closing schools?  


drawing parallels with another country, Hong Kong (which shares a similar population density as us) has already declared an citywide emergency and started closing down schools in order to limit the spread of the virus after having 5 confirmed cases. This number pales in comparison to that of Singapore’s, yet the incumbent government seems be employing a “softer “ approach in dealing with this crisis.  


in the context of VJC, the teacher left the school on Jan 31, which, optimistically, was the last day the teacher interacted with her colleagues and students in the school compound. The incubation period for this virus is 1-2 weeks. By forcing us to to attend school this coming Monday (10 Feb), the school is running the risk of allowing interactions between potential virus carriers who have yet to exhibit symptoms of the virus and healthy students.  


Yes, the school administration has implemented a host of measures to combat this, such as alternative lecture seating arrangements (which mandate a seat between students), disinfecting of rooms that the teacher was thought to be teaching in, suspension of CCA sessions and blah blah. But to what extent will these solutions work effectively? Are these able to effectively ensure zero interaction between the infected and the healthy?  So as long as students see each other, there will be infinitely many avenues for students to interact and mingle with each other (during class, breaktimes, after school etc.)  


So why is the school administration running the risk? For learning/results?  


Wouldn’t it be more optimal to wait for the incubation period be over? Wouldn’t it more optimal to close schools while hiring professionals to disinfect the whole school compound to leave no stone unturned?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f0brmg/a_levels_wuhan_virus_in_vjc/,True,2020-02-08 07:12:54
346,[Rant] School with many foreigners,"TLDR: Foreigner friend constantly asking to copy assignment and uses language barrier as an excuse. Not paying attention in class and asking me for help at the end of the day. 

Tbh i dont even know where to start because im so pissed. I’m currently studying in an Arts school where there are many foreigners. I love talking to them and all because they are nice and chill but everyday they’d just slack. Whenever they need help with assignments they’ll just turn to me and ask me to send them my assignment. 

I get that there is a language barrier but the way they ask for help is ridiculous. Since I’m pretty good at their language and English, they would ask me to translate questions which i gladly help. But the worst part is when they ask me to send them a copy of my own work. I dont mind helping if i really see an effort being put in and they are stuck at afew questions. They’d literally just send me a few texts, wait 2 mins and call me. They’ll start asking me to translate this and that and get annoyed when i patiently explain because they cant understand. Then it always ends up with them saying “i dont get in can you just send me yours? i’ll take a look”. if you cant understand English what makes you think you can understand whatever i’ve written in my essay?? 

Initially it was still okay but recently i find that they are taking things for granted and demanding answers from me. The worst part is when i remind them about submissions and deadlines and they’d just slack. Only until the day before submission they start to panic and ask me to send them answers. 

Just today, we had a file submission and we were suppose to print our own cover page and content page. she wasnt listening in class so she only caught the cover page. when i reminded her about the content page, she said the teacher didnt say anything about the content page so she didnt bother. i then told her that everyone printed the content page and that was when she panicked and started texting me. she sent me a voice message and said “can you just let me see your content page” with an annoyed tone. i didnt reply because i was pissed with her attitude. when we were in the exam classroom, she asked me for my content page and said “why didnt you reply to my text? let me see the content page”. i was literally so shocked and pissed at her attitude. i had enough of this and i texted her to remind her to do her work because its impossible for me to remind her everything. 

i also realised that there is this misconception among foreigners that singapore schools are very slack. When i told the same friend we had deepavali public holiday, she asked me how long. I told her one day and she was like “1 day?? forget it. our country’s public holidays are usually 3-5 days. whats the point of having a one day holiday? i thought singapore have alot of holiday.” and i was so annoyed. i told her if she didnt want the holiday she could come to school herself and to singaporeans, that one holiday matters to us. 

I just feel that many of them don’t understand our culture which is fine since they can learn. Things like wikipedia is not reliable they cant understand that. Thats fine. But ranting to me about how the lecturer is stupid for wanting us to get our sources from reliable source just shows me that they arent willing to learn and accept things.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jvrx75/rant_school_with_many_foreigners/,True,2020-11-18 04:10:07
347,[JC] Relationship advice,"Hi, firstly, sorry I know this probably isn't the right subreddit but I feel like this really is the most suitable because the people here know about JC life and rigour and how it can affect relationships.

I've been with this guy for almost 6 months and to put it simply - I feel that we don't see each other enough and I think it's getting even worse now. We're in the same JC but different classes and barely anyone knows about us being a thing so we don't hang out in school almost at all. Our timetables are also quite different and end at different times most days so we don't meet up after school to have dinner either. Some exceptions are on fridays or on occasional days when we end relatively early (2-3+), when we would eat out or go to his place. 

The past few months also has some public holidays and school holidays as you would know, and some of those days I go over to his house. But now that there are no more public holidays (until nov), and with promos coming, we just don't see each other anymore. When I suggest going over at the end of the week he said he's too busy. I know JC life is rigorous and there's a lot of work and tests, I understand, because I'm also in JC, but am I unreasonable for being unhappy that he can't even spare a few hours of the evening?  It was after we haven't spent alone time together for about 2 weeks. This is also not the first time. A few times that I initiated anything he said he's busy or too tired.

I want to be understanding and don't want to force him if he's busy or tired, that's why even if he says so I don't kick up a fuss. But in my heart I just can't help but feel concerned over our relationship and sometimes wonder if he just doesn't enjoy being with me anymore. To be honest, I also don't feel like I'm asking for a lot. I don't ask for him to hang out with me regularly, have dinner after school, and not even video call. 

I know a relationship shouldn't be measured by the hours spent with each other, but I don't know...barely spending time doesn't seem healthy to me either?? I know he's busy and so am I, but I'm willing to spare that few hours, but he isn't. I'm very conflicted because I don't know if it's reasonable for me to think this way. Oh man, JC is really just screwing all of us over. 

I don't know what I'm looking for from you all - advice, words of comfort etc?? I admit that I'm feeling kinda insecure but I can't help it. Thank you all for taking your time to read thus.

tldr ; me and my jc bf barely see each other, when I take the initiative to ask he said he's too busy.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/id97lk/jc_relationship_advice/,True,2020-08-21 04:19:49

No matter how much we tell him to do work, no matter how much we force him to contribute, he just doesn’t. Even if he does, he writes 50 words and it’s way below satisfactory. 

When he comes for meetings, he just mutes his mic and disappears. Even if he answers, it’s useless and it’s because we pester him to check if he’s still even around (since everything is on skype)

When we tell him how to improve on his trashy work, he automatically defends himself when his points are clearly terrible. He doesnt even have a good understanding of what the WR is supposed to be like (which is why his content is irrelevant) he doesn’t know what we’re doing nor does he try and the rest of us are absolutely done with him.

We’re planning to draft a contract that says that if he continues not to do work, we have every right to remove his name from the WR. If he continues to do so, even after we confront him, can we actually do so?

352,[A Levels] Ultimate Study Guide for Chem Pract,"Just saw a post asking for help with practicals and it reminded me of my own struggles last year. Decided to dedicate a post to helping you guys perfect your practicals based on your skill levels. I've divided the various knowledge levels below. If you:

**A) Are completely lost during mock practicals and find yourself writing to the last second of your mock tests. When you do a practical test, you follow instructions line-by-line and are unable to predict what the question testing on.**

If you are still staring at your practical notes and trying to memorise reactions and tests without even understanding what is going on (aka what the tests are for, why there is ppt, what is an aliquot, etc), *put your practical notes down now and stop re-reading lines that don't mean anything to you*. The reason why you're so lost and all your friends seem to understand what they're reading perfectly is not because you're stupid, but because they already understand their basic chemistry concepts while you don't. Trying to study the same way as them right now will only demotivate you and demoralise you to hell's end.

Here's what you should do instead:

1. Put away your practical notes, and take out your chemistry notes. Chapters you should be very familiar with: Solubility, Ionic Equilibria, Chemical Equilibria, Reactive Kinetics. Watch videos (ChemistryGuru) on those chapters, he highlights the common question types and how to break them down. Very good for noobs and novices. Don't touch organic chemistry yet if your concepts are especially weak.
2. Once you're more comfortable with your concepts, read through your practical experiments. Not your notes, but the experiments that they made you try in school. Take note of the types of measurements they are making you take. Is it time, temperature, pH, volume of gas? You are note expected to know why, but you should be able to get familiar with the objective of the experiments and hence be able to predict the kind of questions they will ask later on. This should make you more comfortable with tackling the questions later on, even if you don't know *yet* how to answer them.
3. Once you're familiar with the common experiments, objectives, and questions, go over each experiment carefully. Read each step, and understand *exactly* what is going on in the experiment. Here are questions that you should ask: Why can this be in excess, but this has to be exact measurement? Once you understand those concepts, you should be able to move on to  section B.

**B) Can complete QA tests but get lost when they test concepts that are more obscure, usually finish during the last 10minutes of mock practical.**

1. While reading your practical experiments, write down the chemical reactions occurring in each step. These formulas are easily found in your notes, answer scripts, or chemistry notes. You are not expected to know how to form them yourself, but you are expected to understand what they mean when you see them. Point to each ion/compound, and say where it came from. Was it precipitated from another reaction? Was it from dissolving an ionic compound? GIVE ME ANSWERS.
2. Read through the questions and redo/read the answers. Redraw the graphs and make the calculations with the provided measurements. Progress to cover the answers and use provided readings to ""complete"" the experiment in your head. You'll start to see same experiments are just asking for the measurements of different reagents, but the experiment, formulas used to solve your stoichiometry equations, and concept-based questions are exactly the same.
3. Pick up your organic chemistry practical notes. Recite their reagents and observations. Remember, the goal is not to memorise yet, but get familiar. If you try to cram too many things into your brain when your concepts are not yet solidified, you can end up getting 0 marks instead of 50%.
4. Once you are comfortable with analysing reactions, tests, and experiment types, move on to section C.

NOTE: If you are struggling too much regarding understand the experiment objectives, just ask your tutor/a friend who is good at chemistry. Don't waste an entire day staring at nothing when they will be able to explain it clearly to you in minutes, and don't ask a friend who isn't very good at chemistry either - very easy to go off topic or just say ""lol gg"" and find comfort in each other's confusion.

**C) Have all concepts down, but make a few mistakes here and there wrt calculations. Sometimes struggle to recognise the more obscure tests, but otherwise can get through paper comfortably.**

1. Pretty straightforward from here. Your concepts are super solid now, so it's just memory work left to get that last 20-30%. Time to read up on the unconventional questions and get comfortable.
2. Things to memorise: Planning steps + necessary formulas (they should come easily to you now when you recite them, now is just a matter of getting them on paper and getting the formulas down pat), process of preparing organic reagents (peep last year's organic QA which killed many people), colour of transition metals (a pain in the ass but necessary), white flame yellow flame (basically your periodic table notes), etc.
3. Free marks. Why could your reading be inaccurate? Why did you use this apparatus instead of the other one? What kind of reaction is this?
4. Non-written paper equations. These are the equations that can't be found in your chemistry notes because they aren't tested in written papers. They are tested when MOE randomly decides to be a spawn of the devil that year. DM me if you want a list of all of them, I'll dig out this set of notes I have on them.
5. Continue revising till you can reach section D. Don't give up, it's just the nitty-gritty stuff now.

**D) Are able to finish comfortably, looking through the entire paper over again. Some things trip you up, but otherwise should be able to score \~50 marks and above.**

You're pretty much good to go. Maybe go through the unconventional scripts whenever you have time, study your other subjects? It's really up to you lol, all the best!

\----

I'm not 100% on my concepts now so I probably missed out a few other key concepts, so if I missed out anything please comment it and help each other out :) Studying practical when your base concepts are quite weak is *very confusing* so I understand if you're feeling really demoralised. But once you take the time to understand the 1 or 2 concepts which have been always been confusing to you, you should get that 'Eureka!' moment to propel you forward in studying for practicals. It's not rocket science, even though it may seem foreign and undecipherable right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hqwrlu/a_levels_ultimate_study_guide_for_chem_pract/,True,2020-07-14 22:59:39
353,Covid-19 Free Tuition Projects,"Hi everyone, hope all of you are doing well! We understand that recently, many students may be feeling anxious because of learning disruptions brought about by HBL. As such, SGExams is collaborating with and publicising a few meaningful projects which have been initiated to help out those students who are facing academic difficulties.

Some of these initiatives include matching you with tutors from respective organisations and projects who can help you with your work, as well as providing notes for various subjects. On the other hand, if you have the ability and feel like helping other students too, a few initiatives pair you up with tutees to teach the subject of your choice. Please look through the list below (arranged in alphabetical order) and sign up with any of them if you need the help or are interested to be a volunteer tutor.

&#x200B;

**Covid -19 Tutoring Support for Students (CTSS)**

CTSS is an initiative which provides free online tutoring support to students who do not have access to private/online tuition services during covid-19. As a student, we will match you with one or more tutors who can help you in the subjects you require academic support in. Interested tutees can find out more at [https://covidtutoringsupport.weebly.com/](https://covidtutoringsupport.weebly.com/).

357,[Rant] A few thoughts about the state of the education system,"One day, I was scrolling through social media when I came across the article “The lesson to unlearn” which was shared by Professor Ben Leong. In the article, there was a contention between “hacking” vs “learning” and that really struck a chord with me.

Link to article: http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html?fbclid=IwAR3eQeYNePfsMgeCzq1uNw4UoQ1lHRxQQXlKk3TmQmfeBZJJnirWk19NopA

I am sure some of us are old enough to remember when the first temple run game was released, in it the gamer has to guide this explorer through some ruins while side stepping and jumping over traps for as long as possible to get a high score. Similarly, during an examination, we are given a paper filled with questions and our goal is to answer the questions, side stepping certain pre-laid traps and executing the right technique to answer the question archetype. In temple run, when there is a ledge, we swipe up to jump over it, similarly in the exams when we see a “state the definition” type question, we guide our hands to hopefully write down the memorised set of words that will guarantee us the marks. This can be said for the many more question archetypes for different subjects (you get what I mean). In temple run, when you get a high score, you are happy asf as you are rewarded with the bragging rights and contentment, much like being top in your class for a subject. When you forget to jump, you fall into the ledge and the game prompts you to restart (usually after an Ad commercial). For the exams, if you don’t make the cut, there is either no restart button for some, or a lengthy year wait. That may be why part of the education game is to attempt as many questions as possible to ensure that we do not execute the wrong move during the exams. “Eh this question may come out”, “Cambridge like to test this type of question, so pay attention”, if I may say, it appears that the way to play the exams game is to execute the all the right moves in the right places,, essentially, if one is to very carefully and faithfully execute all the right lines of code, they will be rewarded with the coveted A grade

Now this is all fine and dandy, especially when it is said that through studying for the examinations, we are compelled to learn all the content knowledge beforehand, which is essentially the whole purpose of school, to school us about the things that we ought to know. But to what end? Is it not quite hilarious that we cram so hard until this certain date, where afterwards, some of us essentially swear off all the things we crammed, just for the grade? I may also like to suggest a few problems that ensue as a result.

1. Learning not for the sake of learning but for the means to an end

2. Killing off and traumatizing people who may associate learning with exams and are forever ridden with certain PTSDs like the common math trauma

3. The misalignment of interest away from learning, even narrowing and predicating the scope and depth of knowledge. Essentially, if it is not in the syllabus then why the heck should I care about it mind-set. Also, the setup of artificial barriers to entry to certain topics. If I cannot do this question on this topic, then I can’t go further.

4. The whole issue on standardized test being unfairly benefiting certain students and not others.

5. The whole notion that one needs to learn a number of subjects that need to be contrasting seems counterproductive and predicated on vague ideas of balance or something like that. Imagine someone who excels in Biology being denied the chance to pursue a career in the life sciences because he cannot write an economics essay.

I do appear have some idea on how to improve the system but that may be for later posts. Do leave your thoughts, suggestions, criticisms, and really give the article a read.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hp84qq/rant_a_few_thoughts_about_the_state_of_the/,True,2020-07-12 02:56:46
358,[JC] the virus really just HAD to peak during jc orientation :(,"Maybe it's just me, or my new school, but orientation isn't going as well/as exciting as I'd hoped it be because of the damn virus. The step-up measures that all schools have put into place are really draining all the fun out of orientation. The four houses J1s are split into for my school have to come at different times of the day. We haven't sat together in the same place before. We hadn't learnt the mass dance that our ogls had prepared for us. There's no hype because we rarely get to see other houses to perform for cheers to them :(. It isn't anyone's fault, but I just feel really disappointed over the fact that our ogls and sc have spend so long planning our orientation, only to have so much of it cancelled. After the newest cases of community spread, I'm very sure that MOE is prolly going to bring in even more enhanced measures, and I honestly don't know how much of J1 life we will miss out on because of this stupid virus. I wanna thank everyone, in other schools as well, who've taken so much time off their usual schedules to tweak our orientation plans so that they would align with the safety measures, and also for still trying their best to hype us up. To all orientation planners, group leaders and screw it, even teachers, I understand how painful it is for painstakingly-thought out plans to be cancelled, and I hope yall don't get your hopes down cus the J1s (esp me) are counting on yall! And to all J1s, since the depressing virus situation may not provide us with hype, we gotta self-high and hype our cohort mates up in order to make orientation even more fun :) All the best for life, and stay safe too :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ezu7u0/jc_the_virus_really_just_had_to_peak_during_jc/,True,2020-02-07 07:51:21
359,[Uni] Am I missing something here? How do ya’ll Uni students cope with the workload at all??,"I’m in NS and will matriculate next year. My friends told me that one mod in Uni is equivalent in content to one ENTIRE H2 subject in JC, and I’ll take 4-5 mods in Uni/semester. So I decided to try my hand at some Uni Math modules (Calculus I and linear algebra) and I was dumbfounded to find out that it’s true.

As per title, I was wondering if that’s the case HOW IN THE WORLD do people in Uni cope with that workload at all?? And not only cope, some of my seniors tell me they’ve had far more of a ‘life’ (esp dating life haha) in Uni than they did in JC...how??

I haven’t been studying for a while (NS) and when I remember JC all I can remember was barely being able to follow the syllabus in pace with my class and mugging 6,7,8 hours per day for almost 6 months straight (and even then I couldn’t get a single A for prelims). 

Hours upon hours of finishing thick stacks of PYPs and TYSs...

Did very well for A levels in the end, and was thinking I should take up NUS Comp Sci+ Math DDP because I have a passion for both. I thought I could handle it cuz my A level results were good. Now I’m having second thoughts

Those in Uni, how do y’all manage the gigantic workload compared to JC?

EDIT: Really appreciate all the comments on here, but they can all be boiled down to ‘work hard, manage your time and you can too’. I Guess I wasn’t specific enough in my question, let me clarify.

Uni can roughly be calculated to cover 8x the syllabus of JC in equivalent time (if I’m doing my math right). Does that mean I have to work 8x as hard? 

Either Uni exams are way easier, I’m doing my math really wrong here (which is horrible for a future Math grad lol), or I’m missing something. If so what am I missing?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h8118m/uni_am_i_missing_something_here_how_do_yall_uni/,True,2020-06-13 21:05:05
360,[A Levels] U for H2 Econs throughout JC to A in A Levels,"i received my A level results yesterday!!

h2 economics has been the bane of my existence since i entered jc. i have never gotten above an E in any test ever. j1 ct1, lecture tests, class tests. mostly U, some S. for promos, all my classmates were happy that they had improved from CTs and i remember my guy friend was so happy that he got a B and when he saw me so happy he asked if i had gotten A. little did he know, i had just scraped an E (46%) and was just overjoyed to pass. when jc2 came, it was worse. my micro was already weak, added to completely new topics from macro.... i started to zone out and skip lectures to eat lunch with friends or study other subjects. for one of my lecture tests, i actually scored 0/20. my own teacher wrote ""what happened to you?"" on my script. somewhere after ct1, when i scored a U (again), i woke up and realised A levels was just under 8 months away. so i started putting in double the effort i'd put in in j1. i started studying the content myself and going for consults. and i actually understood the concepts, but for some reason i couldn't score in the essays. mid years came, and i scored a big fat U. not 0 anymore, but still a fail grade. i was discouraged, and i knew time was running out. i signed up for econs tuition as a last resort.

the tuition did really help, the notes provided were concise and summarised my school notes with all the right keywords. i started to feel more confident in my answers, and i thought maybe if i could get a C for prelims and then a B for A levels, i would be satisfied. but when prelims came, i got another rude shock. i scored an E, again only scraping a pass by one mark (46%). meanwhile my friends and classmates were all celebrating with their Cs and Bs and even As. the same guy friend mentioned above scored an A and this time i turned away from him before i could break down. i cried when i received my econs results. i felt like the double effort i'd put in over the last few months to catch up on content and build my micro foundation was for nothing. 

but this time, i knew my problem. i had severe time management issues -- often when the exam finished i hadn't even started on the third essay. i went to my tuition teacher and school tutor for help. they both told me there was only one way -- to write 3 essays a day, in 2h15min, until i could train myself to finish a paper.

by this point, there was only a month left to the econs paper. and i felt like there was no hope. being idealistic, of course i wanted the A, but was it realistic to go from E to A? nevertheless, i started writing. it sucked. after the first week, i still had barely enough time to even start the third essay. my hands hurt from the constant writing. i had to use the same tactic for csq as well. i finished 9 or 10 school papers and yet i still couldn't finish writing. the same thing happened in the second week. unbeknownst to my friends and then-bf, i was crying in the school toilet on study breaks because i felt like a failure. i even wished i had taken any other subject but econs.

but as time passed, my writing speed did improve. i found that the more i wrote, the more i was able to recall content faster. and it really helped. but by then, i faced a new set of problems. my micro had always been weaker than macro and in my bid to finish a paper, i'd neglected revising my content. with A levels the next day, i walked in knowing almost nothing about market structure or the tax/subsidy part of DDSS. i was only strong in market failure and the whole of macroeconomics, which was what i was banking on for the essay.

the paper was bad. everyone remembers the csq question about globalisation being reversible like wtf is that?? and for the essay, afterward when i went on reddit, i saw everyone had done the market failure qn. and written sources that i hadn't thought of. i knew i hadn't done spectacularly. i'd left some marks blank for the csq (mainly the 2m questions). but at the same time i was proud of myself, because it was the FIRST time in my whole life i'd actually managed to finish an econs paper!!!

the week before results day, i started praying. praying for at least a C. because i didn't have high hopes. one of my friends from my clique comforted me, saying she had gotten E in prelims and then A in A levels but i felt like that was really the miracle case, 1 in 1000 kind of chance. i thanked her but told her to be realistic about the situation and not to give me false hope.

when results day came i didn't dare to open my cert for an hour. those letters would decide my whole future, at least for the next few months. i had two panic attacks and had cried twice by the time an hour passed. my best friend and i promised to open our certs together, and so when i finally opened my cert, my eyes happened to land on the bottom letter first. i saw H2 Economics -- A. not a C, not a B, but the most coveted A. i tell you there was no way to describe the way i felt in that moment. i screamed. and then i broke down. i couldn't believe it. i was shaking and gasping and i felt like my skin was tingling all over and like i was about to faint. 

honestly i still cry because i'm so overwhelmed that all the effort i put in paid off despite all the odds. so i want to say it's possible. please don't give up. and i'm sorry if this post sounds like i'm bragging, but i'm honestly not --- as someone who has been an econs failure throughout, i just wanted to share my joy with reddit because my heart is so full to bursting :"""") and of course if anyone needs any tips feel free to pm me i'll try my best to answer!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7pv93/a_levels_u_for_h2_econs_throughout_jc_to_a_in_a/,True,2020-02-23 00:25:57
361,[O levels] Hardwork > results,"Ok so , I’m also a sec 4 student and I used to be worried about o levels so much. But in the end, I realised it was all about the efforts u put in and not the grades. Yes , ur l1r5 or l1r4 does count but that doesn’t determine ur future. I used to be getting l1r5 39 and for prelims after much hard work I got 13. On Monday even if I got sth much worse, I will still be so proud of my results because in the end what matters is hardwork. Even a slight improvement like c6 from d7 is also truly amazing because you’ve put in a lot of effort , to also beat the moderation and pass in o levels . That is truly exceptional.

I'm pretty bored while editing my notes... so, im open to giving essay consults

If you are a J2, or a soon-to-be J1, this is for you.

I'd analyse your essay, so you know exactly what needs fixing.

You don't need to write a new essay. Old ones will do. Just make sure it truly represents what your standard of writing is normally like / at its best :)

Applies to History and GP essays only!

I'd summarize what I think your argument is, suggest how you could have developed the argument further, and show you which parts of your argument were proven/unproven

Kind of like giving your essay an X-ray?

Won't say too much else.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bg35a5/poly\_retaking\_os\_to\_possibly\_go\_2020\_jae/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bg35a5/poly_retaking_os_to_possibly_go_2020_jae/)

TLDR of that post: I was a former SST student who had an L1R5 of 11-2 = 9. I messed up my 2019 JAE by placing only two JC and ten poly choices. Appeals to 6 JCs failed, and I landed in NP IT.

This post continues that ever weird story of breaking the education system by taking the unconventional route of poly to JC.

**Narrative**

In my time in NP IT, I did my best to make my time there as fruitful as possible, joining CCAs and working hard there. My first semester GPA was 3.86. Yet something kept feeling empty within me, throughout the entire year. I seem to have a weird fetish of reading A Level syllabuses, especially H2 Mathematics, a lot of the time, rather than studying polytechnic content.

Hence, I proceeded with being a private candidate for O Level Higher Chinese and Additional Mathematics. It was a surreal experience, of something that ordinary people do not see. I remembered that day I stepped into Bukit Merah Secondary to do my HCL Oral about National Day Parade. I saw a couple of Chinese nationals who were from private schools and made friends with one of them. Another time during my HCL Paper 1 at Queensway Secondary, I chose to do the topic about how citizens become more unhappy when government efficiency increases. When I told a Chinese teacher there about my continuous writing choice, she shook her head. Oh well.

One year later, the day came where my O Level results came out. I remember how my entire poly programming class was counting down to its release on the online portal. I refreshed. HCL, B3 (was D7), A Math, A2 (was A2). That means an L1R5 of 11-4, or 7. It was a crazy experience as the class celebrated, and I proceeded with JAE 2020.

I wasn't even sure if the choice to go JC made sense then. I built a poly life for myself. Should I do it? I didn't know if I would seriously go JC, and its actually quite unlikely that I would make the switch. But the day comes where JAE 2020 results are released. On a text message, I was posted to ACJC, my first choice in the 2019 JAE. I remembered how I walked around my polytechnic school building as I thought it through. I made the switch. Dropped out a few days later from poly, and I joined ACJC for real, with the combination of H2 Physics, H2 Computing, H2 Mathematics and H1 Economics. It's a dream come true.

**Reflections**

I didn't think I would actually make the switch. In the eyes of most people, it would be delusional. Who does that? Isn’t that wasting 1 year of my life? Ten times more people do the switch in reverse! But I don't know why I couldn't shake the idea off. I have little interest in getting employed this soon in my life, and wanted to go to university, and not just any course. 3.86 was excellent, but I was sure I wouldn't be able to maintain it. All I wanted to have is the JC experience, with its rigour. Polytechnic was too technical for my liking. I preferred theory and examinations. And no, I don’t see it as wasting 1 year, but rather saving 4 months.

Of course, there are many things I missed about poly—my classmates, the food court food, and the fact that there's air conditioning everywhere. On the plus side, my commute to ACJC is only 10 minutes long, compared to NP, which was 30 minutes. Also, I like the catchy ACS anthem too. As for the curriculum, the JC way is just more structured and predictable, and it has exams! I missed the proper reviews.

I was unsure if one year of poly would have made me unable to cope with the JC life. Fortunately, it doesn't seem to be true so far, and I am coping well. The content is coming in at a decent pace, yet I haven't face any snowballing. Overall, this was a sad decision to undertake, but I'm living the dream now. And that's all I want.

Feel free to write your questions about my switch, maybe about comparison or procedures. Hopefully, this post will help the few who wants to make the switch.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g7pasj/poly_jc_my_journey_from_poly_to_jc/,True,2020-04-25 23:07:56

Edit: Im not talking about those asking for other people’s experiences and opinions, I’m talking about those who ask for information that can be found on school websites, uni websites etc such as “Can I get into med school with just H2 Chem” or “Are there post grad law programs in SG”",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g606dd/meta_why_do_people_like_to_post_questions_that/,True,2020-04-23 04:24:25

368,[rant] To my JC Chem Teachers,"heads up: not a hate rant if you're here for that. 

Because I don't have the balls to text her HAHAHA. 

For context, my chem in sec3/4 actually sucked. I dont know how I survived through those 2 years and scraped through IP exams with a B3. Literally every common test I did for chem was a borderline pass (I'm talking on the dot 15/30 kind of tests). My saving grace was practical, where I usually scored either full marks or really close to it by studying my ass off and point blank memorising the mole equations for titrations (I didnt really understand what was going on I just memorised what I needed to do for the types of questions that could come out and fit in the numbers). My chem teacher knew I was crap at chem, but he never really tried to help me out apart from throwing me in some massive remedial session where he would just give us a worksheet and tell us to finish it. Every day my mom made me do chem practices that I sucked at because I didn't even have any foundation to build on, so the practices just made me confused and really made me hate chem because I had to do them everyday or get screamed at the moment I reached home. TLDR i hated chem with a passion and every exam made me scared and traumatised from all those bare minimum passes (idek how I passed. I was so bad I spent 2 years not knowing it was Zn2+ and not Zn4+/-.  Fun story i once spent 5 minutes in a test wondering if it was 4+ or 4- and it turns out it was neither. I didn't know how to write chemical formulae and sure as hell didnt know how to write chemical equations. I never learnt how to draw dot cross diagrams and I didnt know what ionic/metallic/covalent bonding was). 

Come to JC, I wanted to have more options for uni courses, so I decided to take science. And I didn't take Physics in Sec 4, so I took Biology. Aka I had to take Chem. So my mom made me go for Chem tuition because it was pretty obvious to everyone that I sucked at chem. And that was honestly the best decision of my life legit I am sososososososoo thankful to my tuition teacher. Although she never gave me any special attention or anything, her lessons were supersuper clear and helped me build up my foundation in chem, as well as understand JC chem really well. And she really helped me brush up my answering technique so I got all the keywords and didn't waste time explaining things unnecessarily as well. The first time I got an A in my 1st common test I was shookt af let me tell you. Ofc I studied my ass off for chem especially because of the traumatising secondary school years, but chem has always been the subject that's managed to boost my confidence and made me feel less stressed (ik im flexing but I've never gotten anything below an A throughout JC). It's like when I go onto reddit after exams, reading anything about math/GP makes me scared as hell and I just try not to go on reddit because I feel really disappointed in myself, but chem has never made me feel this way. Even if i mess up, I know there's a solid chance of me making it up in the next paper, which really cheers me up unlike maths where I just feel a sense of impending doom and stress. 

My JC tutor was honestly also amazing and she always explained concepts really well as well! And I'm just so thankful and so blessed to have had these two chem tutors throughout JC that made my feelings towards chem do a 180. Both of them are kinda scary though so I'll probs just thank them with a generic thank you message after As, but I just wanted to post this on reddit. If there are any teachers lurking on this sub, just know that you're really appreciated!!

369,[JC] Why is __JC not good?,"tldr at bottom
I know the title sounds pretty offensive sorry about that but while I was reading through DSA posts I saw quite a few comments saying ""dont come to cj"", and I'm kind of concerned because I originally wanted to go there because of their Arts programmes (I'm exploring ELL) 

And is ACJC really very elitist? Heard their Arts is also pretty good but some students can get very condescending/rude? Like those ""sports tables"" etc (As you can see I'm aiming to go to schools with good Arts stream)

If I DSA to NYJC would it be too ambitious? Most recent L1R5 was 18 (Eng: 2, Chi: 4, SS/Hist: 1, Pure Lit: 4, EM: 2, AM: 5) I dont even know if I'll make it through their cut throat education much less their DSA 
If theres any recommendations in terms of other schools please drop them too I've read through quite a number of JC posts but I'm still very unsure if i should consider DSA or just continue what i originally planned (JAE and hope for the best)

Tldr: CJ and AC good or not + nyjc dsa am I crazy

Edit: pure bio: 5 pure chem: 8 
Edit again: my l1r5 based on my term 1 results oh boy

372,[A levels] Never enough?,"Whatever revision i’ve done seems like it’s never enough? 
I struggled through most of my J1 however I miraculously promoted and told myself at the start of J2 I never want to feel this sense of uncertainty of whether i can even promote ever again as i fear history will repeat come A levels 
Here I am 4 months away from As and this uncertainty is slowly creeping.
At this rate, I don’t even know how to keep myself in check and I know I have to work 10x harder perhaps even more.
I don’t know, just the feeling of how this exam will conclude my 2 years in this hellhole and determine my entire future makes me question if it is even worth it. 

Also now that CB has ended I honestly feel that I’ve wasted away these 2 months by not making full use of my time and I’m starting to panic

376,[poly] [O levels] to go or not to go? a short discussion of my experiences,"hello!!

its been a couple of months since i posted the long discourse about scoring in o level english and i'm back to share about my new poly life thus far! i know many of my o level juniors are currently in the process of receiving their EAE results, and many are also considering their choice of school since the o level papers are drawing near.

i wanted to write this post because i want more juniors to have a greater insight to what poly life is all about, in order to make a more informed decision. that being said, this post is targeted at those who are unable to decide if they would like to stick the jc or poly track, but everyone is welcome to read!

 i chose the poly track instead of jc, though my o level results allowed me the freedom of choice. what am i studying? well, i won't divulge my school, but all i can say is that it's a biology-related science course (you can probably guess by now). 

first, i want to talk about why i chose to go to poly. it was not a decision i made at a spur of the moment, but actually something that i had been thinking about since i was in secondary 2. this field of science has always particularly interested me, so i was very keen on pursuing an education and a future career in the related field. in secondary 4, i applied through EAE and made it to the final stage, but did not get the place in the end. at that point, my results were not good enough to make it in (it's a science course after all). it made me question my goal and in turn, made me work harder to achieve a better score in my o levels. upon receiving my o level results, i realised that i had an option to either go to jc, or continue pursuing my interest in science in poly. when i compared jc and poly, i looked at the differing curriculum requirements. 

let me summarise it for you here. 

jc, as most people would have guessed by now, is a very hectic school life, similar to secondary school. the content covered is also extremely heavy (H2 biology is about 6 times the content of O Level pure biology). apart from that, you still have to take a mix of subjects e.g. Math and Econs or other humanities. It is a physically demanding and stressful 2 years to prepare for A levels. 

is poly easier? well at that time, i didn't know (i'll share my current thoughts later on). but all i knew was that the course i wanted to apply to was an extremely niche course, which would go in depth into the subject matter. when looking up on the different schools and what they had to offer, i also went into NUS and NTU admissions page to make sure the poly course i wanted would make me eligible to the course i wanted to do in uni. this is very important as you do not want to end up with limited uni choices due to your choice of diploma. 

when i considered these two differing styles, i made a final decision to go to poly because i thought that i would be able to score better if i was studying something i enjoyed. 

let's move on, fast forward, to now. i am currently swarming in my assignments and test prep, and i am writing this post in my break time because i wanted to get this off my chest haha. 

so, is poly easy? no. i need to put a big disclaimer here : POLY IS NOT THE EASY WAY OUT OF THE EDUCATION SYSTEM. many people may refute my claim and say ""that's because you're in a science course,"" but i would like to kindly disagree. let me put things into context. how the grading system works in poly -- the Grade Point Average system just a quick google search will tell you how to calculate it, and each school website provides the calculation formula (I THINK). to sum things up, an 80 marks is an A -- warrants you a GPA of 4.0. 75 marks is a B+, warrants a GPA of 3.5, so on and so forth. so, the point is that if you want to score well, you need to (realistically) score mostly As. is it easy to do? no. ""but why?"" okay see the thing is, assignments make up a huge portion of the assessments in poly (some courses don't have exams, 100% assignment based). these assignments mean that you WILL encounter working with unreasonable teammates, out of the world assignments where lecturers don't even give clear instructions, and basically a lot of self-directed research and learning. also if you happen to score all As for one semester and attain a 4.0, you will kiss your 4.0 goodbye if you don't score all As in the second semester as well, because GPA is cumulative. 

so if you're considering poly, you might be wondering if you are suited to this style of education and learning. 

lessons are conducted in lecture and tutorial style, and this may seem familiar as jc also terms their classes as such. but for poly, its very much self-directed learning. there isn't any 'homework', but there are weekly submissions that you may have, and there are also tutorial worksheets that you ideally should be completing before attending your tutorial sessions. personally, my tutors don't really care if you complete your tutorials or not, because its our loss if we don't complete them anyway. it's a more free learning environment in a sense that we have the freedom to take charge of our own learning. but with that being said, it is also important that you pace yourself and have good time management. 

the thing is, assignments come in all the time. lets say assignment A is due in 5 weeks time. sounds like a lot of time, but in the 5 weeks, other modules will assign their own assignments as well. this 5 weeks becomes quite limited if you push everything to the end. there is no time for procrastination, and good time management is a MUST in order to produce quality work. (also u cannot escape subjects that are like english lessons because they are compulsory modules that all students have to take, lots of writing, communication, presentations)

so if you feel that you are unable to take charge of your learning and would prefer a more structured learning environment, maybe poly is not for you. 

i know i've been rambling on a lot and my thoughts have been really disorganised (its the exam stress), so yea i guess that about it! definitely read up loads about the industry, and compare the similar courses that each school offers, and the prospects of each course. 

do feel free to ask me about anymore poly-related questions and i'll try to answer them to the best of my ability! also if you are interested in sciences and would like further insight, just drop me a private message! will be more than happy to help :"")) 

have a good day!

377,[JOBS] Got scammed by part-time job?,"I saw this slides creator job opening a month ago for Mathteach in Fastjobs and was accepted after going through a trial run. The entire process looks legit as they have their own google drive and SOP. Basically my job entails translating the handwritten math workings/graphs into powerpoint slides using the template given.

For my first assignment, i was given 42 questions on models. I took around 40 mins for 1 question because I was supposed to solve it myself too (after a given example). For 1 question, I’d need to make 6 slides so in total I made 252 slides. I was told that the remuneration for one question is $5.

So I handed in my assignment a week later and the person went completely MIA on me for a month (until today). I trued searching them on social media and linkedin but to no avail. I’ve texted and emailed them multiple times but no replies.

So... am I being scammed off my time and effort while they sell my completed slides elsewhere? What should I do? Should I report this anywhere?

edit: if you’re in the same situation as me, please DM me and we’ll work together to file a dispute along with the other victims to stop this scamming scheme. It may look harmless at first, but we wouldn’t know what she’ll do with our personal information and whatnot that she has collected. Or if this person was even real from the start. Please reach out to me!

So I’ve been rejected from countless CCAs , programmes and attachments ever since secondary school. I never shyed away from new opportunities and will always be the one to sign up for the leadership positions, programmes etc . But somehow I’m always rejected. Always . I was rejected from council in my secondary school (passed everything until interviews) . I was rejected from 3 CCAs in JC ( including interact , I thought the interview went well and I seriously don’t know why I was rejected when so many others got in.) I was rejected from a student group and a debate programme in JC . Granted, I come from a rather good(?) JC but I seriously don’t think this amount of rejections is normal . How can I be rejected from every single thing I wanted? I just don’t understand. I prep for interviews, do my best to be friendly and bubbly during interviews and answer as best as I can but Im always never good enough.

Recently, I was rejected from a leadership position. I just feel really depressed right now. The worst part is , I really thought everything went well until I got the message that I was rejected.  I don’t know whats wrong with me . Im well liked by my peers and I am quite sociable too (sorry for the self praise buT really man im not a shy person)

What should I do? Why am I never good enough? 

p.s My studies havent been great either, just adds on to my list of things to cry about

EDIT:
I asked for feedback on my recent leadership interview and they said it seemed like I wasnt confident during interviews (buttttt i thought i sounded confident ahh im not sure why)

and that my task(done prior to interview) was interesting but the role I was going for was highly competitive and I didnt really stand out . :”

381,[Uni] [Poly] [A levels] I am a Poly Grad who took Private A levels in NS AMA,"Hey all, 

Since I saw two posts so far about Poly to JC  stories, I thought I'll share my story too. At the same time, I hope to be able to both encourage people and answer any questions people might have on taking A levels as a private candidate (As there does not seem to be much info available online). 

Background:

I enrolled in a business course in poly because I had no idea what I wanted to do, I thought maybe I could grow to like business as I studied it. I was wrong, I hated studying business, I discovered that I was more inclined towards the humanities and social sciences. By the time I discovered this I already finished my first year with a miserable GPA of 2.2. However, I played around in poly too much and by the time I tried pulling my GPA up, I could only graduate with a trash GPA of 2.78.  I was blindly hoping that by some miracle I could get accepted into NTU or NUS because I wanted to do a solid humanities degree. Driven by passion, I applied to NTU 3 times. Naturally, I got rejected 3 times, not only from NTU but from every single local university I applied to. It was something that I should have expected, but still, I remember being overwhelmingly disappointed. I hated myself for being unfocused and immature in my earlier poly days. I saw all my peers entering universities of their choices and I saw myself lagging behind not being able to do anything about it. Regret hit me really hard.

The A levels: 

When I was in NS, near the start of my first year, I started researching private universities and overseas universities. I mean this was the only way forward right? I couldn't make it to my dream universities so I should settle for what I deserve, come to terms with what options I had.  (Note: I am not intentionally trying to put down private u students, but I believe given the choice wouldn't anyone trade for a better opportunity?) As I browsed through entry requirements for Aussie unis or private degrees, it sort of hit me, why don't I try taking the A levels as a private candidate? It was an immensely terrifying thought, JC students who take the A levels full time complain about the rigour and difficulty of A level subjects, what chance does a half-assed Poly grad have? As I researched more and more into taking A levels privately it seemed that many people shared the same sentiment. The success rate of private As (or retaking As) is miserably low. Additionally, when I reached out to my friends who did the A levels, they advised me not to do it, it is difficult enough in JC what about part-time without guidance? I was just setting myself up for failure. Compounding this, I was planning to study for the A levels while serving my National Service full time. How in the world am I even hoping for success against such odds? 

To be frank, I was quite depressed. The ticket out of the mess I created seemed impossible to get. Yet somehow, I sucked it up and applied as a private candidate to take the As in 2019. What followed was roughly 2 years of hell. I focused on studying as my main priority, everything else took a backseat. With this, I actually lost friends because I didn't socialise anymore. The single-minded determination that took over me was something even now I can't seem to muster up. Every bit of free time was dedicated to studying, lunch was constantly skipped to study, I cancelled plans, paid for duties just to have free time. It was exhausting. In the day I was dealing with very difficult regulars and NSFs who were very snake-ish (Clerks yall would know) in the night I was spending 3-4 hours trying to focus. Additionally, the entire time I worked towards my goal, I was plagued by constant uncertainty, I think anyone taking a major exam like the As would understand that uncertainty. But man to put up with that and the shit NS throws at you daily for 2 years makes for really unpleasant memories. 

The Results:

Come Feb 2020, I had ORD-ed and sat for the As the previous year. Results day was the deciding moment whether the past 2 years were worth it or a complete waste of money and time. I was trying to expect the worst possible outcome and it was really freaking me out. But when I opened up the results I scored a BBB/DA. Rebased from /80 to /90 I scored 77.5Rp (68.75/80 x 90) (The reason I rebased my score to 77.5Rp is because I managed to get into NUS FASS through ABA, based on past posts on r/SGexams it seems that people who got ABA scored between 77-79RP). 

I couldn't believe it, I actually did decently for once. My dreams and hopes, they could finally be real, the work and sacrifices put in weren't for nothing. I applied to both NTU and NUS. I am proud to say that I got offered admission into both courses! 

Takeaway: 

This entire journey was one hell of a ride. I think it changed me to become a more mature and disciplined individual and it taught me that even if some challenge seems insurmountable, you just might have what it takes to overcome it! The key is to believe in yourself despite the odds and work hard to your goal! I'm also damned grateful for this subreddit, the number of times I scroll here asking questions and looking for answers is uncountable. So Thank You  r/SGExams 

In any case, thanks for reading my story! I would be happy to answer any questions! especially from people who are thinking about taking the A levels privately!

382,"[JC] Retaining in JC1 this year, seeking advice on what to do next","Edit: thanks for the support guys! I may not have the time to reply to each and every one of your messages, but do know that I’ve read all of them and I’m extremely grateful for this small yet supportive community :)

Hey there r/SGExams! This is gonna be a long rant so skip this if you don’t care/have the time to read a big chunk of text.

I’m a student from a certain JC in Bishan who was *supposed* to advance to JC2 this year. 

However, because I screwed up pretty badly for promos (got Us for both H2 Chemistry and H2 Mathematics) I was forced to retain in JC1 for 1 more year, with the option of changing my subject combination.

Of course, I was pretty upset about the news at first and simply couldn’t come to terms with the fact that I had to watch all my friends advance to JC2 while I was still stuck in JC1 for another year. 

However, the more I thought about it, the more I realized that retaining was advantageous in its own right. 

Previously, my foundation in JC1 was pretty terrible because I suffer from ADHD symptoms which resulted in me struggling to pay attention during lectures and tutorials (this has been the case for my whole school life and also the reason why I barely scraped through Year 4 IP, haha)

Retaining in JC1 for one more year would effectively mean that I have another year to work on my foundation again so I can get better A-Level results, which is more than a worthy trade-off in my eyes. 

And while retaining will probably mean that I have to give up my current friends and social life, doing well for As will obviously matter more in the long run.

So now that you know more about my situation, here comes my predicament.

As I mentioned earlier, I now have the option of choosing to retake BCME (which I absolutely despise studying), OR, switch to a hybrid or arts stream. 

I’ve consulted many of my close friends and teachers about this, and most of them recommend that I retake BCME since I’m already familiar with the curriculum, having gone through it for one whole year already, which would allow me to have an easier time building up my foundation in preparation for JC2.

However, despite knowing all this, my heart keeps telling me that I should switch to the Arts stream. There’s just something so compelling about having a fresh start in JC with a new subject combination, a new class and a new CCA that I dunno, I’m seriously considering dropping BCME and taking HELM or GELM. 

More importantly, I’ve always considered myself a somewhat artsy student, having obtained straight As for my humanities in my secondary school. I’m confident that if I take this opportunity to have a fresh start in JC1 with a new subject combination, I may possibly be able to unlock my full academic potential.

If you bothered reading all the way to this point... Thank you, kind stranger. I feel extremely lost right now and would appreciate any words of advice from anyone with experience in this matter.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kqv2dd/jc_retaining_in_jc1_this_year_seeking_advice_on/,True,2021-01-06 01:34:18

384,[Uni] Please be more specific when asking questions or for advice,"Hi all, this sub has been great since I joined today. However, a minor trend I notice among people asking questions is that

1. Questions are very vague
2. You *kinda* expect to be spoonfed. 

By themselves, there's nothing wrong with the above two points. The problem is that with this two points, you reduce the quality and accuracy of the answers you get.   


Vague questions means that the answerer either needs to 

* prod you for more information 
* Make assumptions about your case which might be incorrect

Expecting to be spoonfed means that

* ""What is ...""
* Without having done any research (Or you might have! but didn't show it)

&#x200B;

I urge everyone that is here asking or answering questions to try and pushing everyone towards asking better questions!

&#x200B;

For example, questions like ""NTU Biz VS NUS Biz"" - there are so many ways for this question to be answered. Also, the only way for someone to truly be able to answer is properly is to have studied at both institutes, which is highly unlikely. Try and **exercise some brainpower** and think - how can you break the question: ""*NTU Biz VS NUS Biz""* down. 

Eg. Asking about employment prospects, personal experiences with graduates is a good start. **Making the effort** to head to the various websites and looking through the modules is an even better start. Finding out median salaries, cohort sizes etc. are all excellent ways to do research and make your question more answerable.

385,[Jobs] Commonly Asked Job Interview Questions Part 2,"Hello, here's a continuation from Part 1. I've added a few quick links below for easy referrals of my earlier posts. I covered 9 commonly asked questions in Part 1 and I'll cover another 9 today!

Before I go on, this is my **golden tip** especially if I get asked a question that I was not expecting.

When you are going for an interview, if you get offered a **water**, even if you are not thirsty, **ACCEPT**. Reason being if you are dumbfounded by the question, you can take a sip of water before you answer and get a few extra seconds to think of your response or even calm your nerves rather than go silent or ""uhh"", ""umm"". But if you are doing that for every question then you are simply not prepared at all OK so don't drink at every opportunity you get or it's going to look really weird for you.

And I know HR personnels are going to hate me for saying this but even up till today, I apply for jobs even if I know the chances of me being interested of joining them are low or I'm out of my depth. This is especially relevant now when many interviews are being held online.

I apply for those jobs not to take the job but to get interview experience. Having interview experience will help you in many ways when job hunting, especially in how you answer questions (and how you react to the odd weird question you may face). It lets me know how much I'm ""worth"" right now in the industry and when the next opportunity that fits me come, I'm ready to go for it after having been through so many ""practice"" rounds.

Ok back to the questions!!

**Tell me about a time you had a conflict at work/school**

This is a typical behavioral interview question. Managers want to see emotional intelligence and that you have some sort of escalation process in mind (such as 1-on-1, team, then an authority's involvement). Beyond that, not only do managers want a team to be able to sort themselves out, but they also want team members who know how to defuse situations and enable each other to be successful.

My go to example was a situation where I took a step back from the conflict, examined the root reason my colleague was acting the way he was, and made reasonable modifications to my own behaviour to address this. Again, give appropriate examples here.

**How long do you see yourself working for us if you are hired**

This is one of those questions to see if you plan on staying there long-term or not. The company obviously does not want to keep rehiring someone new every few months. It is time consuming and take up resources to onboard a new employee.

My strategy for such a question is to explain what the job does for my career, and why I would be interested in following my career path with said employer. Explain how I see working for the employer would be a benefit to my own goals and objectives, And also bring up the career benefits from working with the employer for a period of time, as well as explaining any additional motivations.

This is my answer that I gave for my last interview. Hopefully that gives you all a starting point for having your own answers.

>I can foresee a long tenure with your company. I am aware of the range of opportunities across the spectrum of my profession with your firm. I've also heard good things about your training and study support programs, which is perfect for my pursue of professional qualifications. If I can achieve promotion, and get the broad experience I need to progress in the industry, I'll be here for quite a while.'

**Do you think you are over qualified for this role**

If you get asked this question, it basically translates to ""We would like to hire someone like you, but we think you are only applying here as a stopgap before you find something better, and we don't want to have to go through the recruitment process again few months down the road"" What you can probably do is to give a good explanation and say that you're looking specifically to get into that industry or to take a position that lets you develop other skills than you've used in the past or simply that you are interested in specifically working for that company for some reason, then I think they would be much more likely to consider your application.

The other advice might be to tone down your CV, cut out some of the big responsibilities or qualifications to make you seem more suitably qualified even before you send in any application if you know you are overqualified. Either way, the reality is that an educated and well qualified person is only likely to stick to a low paying position if there are extreme circumstances. This is especially true in such economic uncertainties and you start applying for jobs that you normally wouldn't go for in normal times.

**Describe your management/working style**

I'd go about letting the hiring manager know that my emphasis is on communication with my colleagues/superiors/subordinates and support with more examples.

**Do you work better alone or as part of a team**

Demonstrate your versatility with even more examples of how you can work alone as needed but you can see the big picture and can succeed in meeting deadlines as part of a bigger team too.

**Our values are A, B & C at this company. Can you tell us a time when you demonstrated these values**

MNCs and big firms like to ask such questions to see if you identify with their organisational identity. Again, give examples to support those values and show the employers that you are able to fit in the organisation.

**What is more important to you? The work or the money?**

It is a shitty question to me, but in the mind of the hiring manager, it probably has some innocent intention, for sussing out your values. They want to know how you approach getting money.

If you answer ""I like money more"" you probably not well suited for some jobs where teams are very interdependent. If a person does not enjoy their work, and if they are not engaged in their industry, etc, chances are they are not making money and never will.

Conversely, if it is a sales job (an analogy) where you have the ability to earn a lot more by closing more deals, they could be asking this to determine whether you are self-driven to make money, or whether you just want to clock in and out of a job, do the minimum, and get a paycheck. That is totally plausible as well.

**Where do you see yourself in five years time?**

In a position with real career potential my correct answer to this question is in a position one or two steps above the one I'm applying for.

It tells the hiring manager that you'll grow in the position and transition naturally. If you see yourself in a totally different role/industry they will assume that you are just there for the for a quick ride and when the opportunity comes you'll jump ship at the first instance

**Do you have any questions for us?**

My go to question is ""Do you have any doubts or red flags about me that i can address for you now?""

This gives me a chance to clear up anything that may have been misunderstood or elaborate on anything that was missed. Otherwise these are some other good ones below to show the hiring manager your genuine intent.

* ""If I were to start tomorrow, what would be the top priority on my to-do list?""
* ""What would you say are the top two personality traits someone needs to do this job well?""
* ""What improvements or changes do you hope the new candidate will bring to this position?""
* ""I know this company prides itself on X and Y, so what would you say is the most important aspect of your culture?""
* ""Do you like working here?""

386,[A Levels] Why are schools still open???,"47 new cases today... This is an insane spike and its not going to slow down soon! If people are now working from home, why can't students stay at home? Students not going to school isnt going to cause economic damage! There is e-learning for a reason. We have e-learning days every year just to practice for this situation. Honestly, if school was to re-open after March Holidays, there are going to be cases in schools, and the virus would legit get out of hand as most schools are really dirty, and students are not that good with hygiene...

Edit: i understand many families cannot afford to take days off for their kids, but if im not wrong the budget 2020 said that money will be given to these families. And if other countries are able to close schools, why cant we? I think its def better for everyone to stay at home for 2 weeks and everyone infected gets identified.

Edit 2: 25th March. 73 cases today, and its starting in schools. Really why are schools still open? its not like young people are immune to the disease! We can carry it to the immunocompromised at home. I seriously do not feel safe to go to school anymore.

392,"[Poly] Dropped from Poly, need advice.","Hi all, I am a 17 y/o (turning 18 later this year) Year 2 student studying an engineering course in SP and I've just received the news that I will not be able to continue the course due to failing too many modules/failing an already repeated module. Right now, I am on holiday break from finishing Sem 1 of Year 2. Upon receiving this news, I was extremely shocked as although I knew I would do bad, I didn't expect to do THIS bad. Hence, I need advice as I feel extremely lost at the moment but do look through the next paragraphs to understand my story a little more.

Firstly, when I was choosing my courses, I've never really went to find out what type of modules I would have to study in a certain course. Although I had an interest in Sports Coaching/Interior Design (more towards Sports Coaching) and my O's results made me eligible for both, I ranked Mechanical Engineering as my first choice as I thought that engineering could be fun and would be better as a career path to my parents. Little did I know that the course would be filled with math and physics modules, along with some coding/designing/drawing modules that required the use of computer software which were really the only modules I enjoyed. The thing is, I've never been that strong at math/physics (I was always more language-inclined, English has always been a strong subject of mine since young) although I did alright in O's for them, getting a B3 on both Math's and a B4 in Physics. The course was simply not what I expected and was extremely content heavy so I had almost zero motivation to do well and simply just went along with the flow. Fast forward to Year 1, I always dreaded having to solve all these equations and formulas that never really stuck in my head and I attained a GPA of 2.5-ish at the end of Year 1 and I thought to myself that okay, all I have to do is get through another 2 years and graduate, after which I would switch courses and try to enroll myself in a course of my interest in Uni after NS. I also left my CCA as I felt like I would be able to improve without it consuming so much of my free time. Throughout the year, I always thought about how if I could just turn back time, I would have went to a different course and my mother even kept asking me again and again whether I liked my course and if I found it interesting to which I would always reply ""ok lorh"" and I think she knew I always lied. 

Honestly, at that time, I genuinely thought I could just survive another 2 years, graduate and be free, but then as we all know, Covid hit. All of my lessons became HBL lessons where I had to sit in front of a screen for hours on end listening to the most boring lectures about Mechanics and Thermofluids. As a person who lacks self-discipline, I completely couldn't focus at all and information came in one ear and out the other. It was unlike normal lessons in class where I was at least engaged in the lesson when the lecturers are teaching face-to-face. I would even daresay that had Covid not happened, I wouldn't have done this badly and would have at least done well enough to continue in the course without much issue. I know that I shouldn't blame this on the virus and that there are plenty of people who still manage to excel but I really feel like it affected my learning due to my lack of self-discipline taking over and a lack of interest in the content being taught. 

As of now, I am trying to appeal to the course chair to be reinstated to repeat the year (or whatever they want me to do to not be dropped). If I am allowed to repeat the year, I will definitely buckle down and study my hardest to graduate as this has truly been a wake up call for me personally. I know I need to change my ways and I intend to. If not, the 2 options I have right now are either to work part time until the next admissions exercise next April, where I will try to DAE to my dream course, or to enlist in the NS right now although I don't feel prepared, both mentally and physically. The pain I feel right now comes from knowing that I have let my family down as they have invested so much time, money and effort into making sure I had a good education and also knowing that I will progress through life in the ""not normal"" way. I have not yet broke this news to my family members as I'm really afraid of how they might react but I intend to in the coming week or two. Anyway, if you have made it this far in the post, I thank you so much for your time and if anyone could give me any advice, criticise me or not, please do so.

From reading the threads which have come before me, I realised that grades are not everything and the interview was so important. I thought I did okay, but seems like it wasn't enough for anything after all. So much for 90rp and a h3.

Studying hard suddenly seems like such a disappointment.

My parents are really against studying law for their own reasons, and it took so long for them to come around to it. Until today, I think they still cannot get over the fact that I don't want to follow in their footsteps. So I have a SMU Law offer and I don't have a NUS Law offer, no DDP offers from either of the schools.

That was what actually motivated me to study hard during JC, to know that if I scored super duper well, I would have a chance to do what I want, but also what my parents want. Still, now that it has come to this, it just all feels really wasted and I feel really stupid all the same.

I know it's such a silly thing to cry about but I don't understand what I did so wrong during the interview. Because it's not my grades - so I know it was the interview that did me in. I'm so disappointed.

My parents don't approve of me studying law, they have said that they will not fund me if I choose to do it as a single degree. I haven't told them that the NUS ddp also rejected me, and that was already the second choice (after the smu ddp) which they had a 50/50 chance of not wanting too. I guess I'll tell them sometime next week and ask again if they will let me study law.

But they're going to ask for the alternatives, and the nus single degree I was offered is the course they want me to go into. I wish I could say I can fund my own university education, but honestly, I doubt it is possible. I was aiming for a university scholarship, but I (again) didn't make it past the interview. I've been looking into options for part-time jobs, but with the covid climate, it's no longer looking as possible as it is when last year I thought of it.

My grandmother said she would fund me if I want to do law, but I also realised after thinking a lot (maybe too much) that that's not even how things are supposed to work. My grandma won't even take money from my parents and I promised her I would earn money soon and give her a great life. And because of my grades none of them are even expecting that I would be rejected in the first place.

I'll be honest and say that I didn't expect to be rejected either.

I spent my entire life studying and working hard to free myself from what my parents want and then here, again, after the struggle to pick my own JC subjects, suffering through one (at least not three right?) subject I would rather have never touched, getting the coveted 90rp, it still, wasn't enough. None of the cip or awards were either. They only got me to lowest levels of the interview and no further.

So I'm stuck. I don't even know how to tell my parents that appeals exist since the chances of a successful appeal are so slim in the first place. Scholarships can't be appealed, so there's no hope that I can study law without a miracle.

I wish I could go back to yesterday when I didn't know the results from nus. Still, wishing never helped.

I don't qualify for pretty much any loan or bursary or financial support schemes, after all, my parents can pay. It's only that they won't, and they will hold that over my head. It's not even a waiting game, because it's not like the universities are going to walk back on their offers or suddenly drop a scholarship on my head - that kind of hope is going to be the death of me.

I can only appeal but I think the next round of waiting, the next wave of disappoint might just break me.

Sorry for the long post. Just needed to get it off my chest, thanks for reading.

&#x200B;

Edit: Thanks for the replies, all of you. Wrote this in a emotionally numb state this morning at 2 am and then even had people replying and dming at 5 am. Wanted to just say again that the SMU ddp was my first choice and nus ddp my second. I don't have much opinion on which law school is better, only that my parents don't want me to study law alone. 

Some people have talked about loans and stuff, yeah, have considered those. But most, if not all, need guarantors. My parents will call me an idiot for wanting to be independent and landing myself in debt even before I graduate. And as you know, low key loan options that don't need parental involvement are... not great. 

CPF loan is out because they wouldn't say yes. MOE tution one needs a guarantor with criteria I can't fulfill. I'd have to start asking relatives who will start a big quarrel with my parents.

I know talking to them will help to progress this but it's difficult to tell them anything. Besides they know I want to study law but they really honestly hate it. They have never approved of anything out of what they have wanted. It all comes with silent (if not shouting lol) disapproval and the whole painful comparison thing.

398,[Post-Exams][University] Is it still possible to find constant friends in uni?,"so i just finished a levels last year and though i had a clique and a bunch of close friends who got me through my jc life, it’s still quite sad to say that i wouldn’t call them my constants... it’s fair to say we were only just close during jc for the sake of having a support system through the stress. and i guess that’s because i couldn’t really vibe with them rly well? perhaps only one of them but we don’t even hang after a levels lol 

so yea i’m just feeling q depressed and lonely rn bc i’m seeing how my other jc schoolmates hang out and gather together frequently on ig stories, and i’m rly envious of them to still hang tgt even after school & exams. it’s such a blessing to have a constant group of close friends to hang out with frequently 

don’t tell me to not compare because really, i don’t think it’s that toxic / bad to be envious of others and self reflect once in a while

and it’s not like i can really ask my jc friends out because like i said we don’t rly vibe (and i cant rly be bothered to try too cos i know we can’t force connections) i still keep in touch w my sec sch friends but we’re rly just acquaintances who will meet once or twice every few months 

and for the very few 2-3 friends who i can rly vibe well with, we haven’t see each other for a v long time so it’s kinda awkward to ask them out and hang 1 on 1 for like a few hrs (it’s like a temporary getaway from the feeling of being lonely and that’s about it, kinda pointless imo) 

what i wld want is a close knitted group of friends where everyone connects well with each other and wld hang frequently (once every 1-2 weeks)? where we wld sustain a constant communication via texts, and u can rly tell anything to and confide in, not those friends who u know will be “there” when u hit them up kinda thing u know? it just hits different 

i’m also q an introverted person who takes time to open up, but once i rly connect well with u and open up i’m q fun to be around with (taken from one close friend of mine LOL) so ya i don’t think i suck at maintaining friendships, it’s more of the introductory making friends part that’s hard to me

sooo i was just wondering if it’s still likely to find constant non-fleeting friendships in university bc from what i read you don’t rly get to stick with the same bunch of friends all the time unlike in pri sch to jc, and coupled w the heavier workload, it makes friendships harder to maintain

i just don’t want to graduate and step into the working society lonely af without gaining a constant group of friends from my education lol :,,)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr6gz3/postexamsuniversity_is_it_still_possible_to_find/,True,2020-03-30 06:13:02

# 1 Curriculum

## 1.1 NUS Nursing

## Curriculum overview

Generally, the first 2 years we focus on learning the different body systems, how they function (Anatomy &amp;amp; Physiology) and dysfunction (Pathophysiology), coupled with each condition’s nursing management and hands-on skills. Interesting modules will also be taught such as communicating effectively and being culturally sensitive in the clinical setting, basic psychology for nurses, mental health nursing, and even ethics and law. The 3rd (and final year for most) will focus more on gearing us for eventual practice in the clinical setting with modules tackling leadership and community health. Finally, we will embark on a 3-month final clinical placement to emulate the real pace and nature of work, ensuring that we are competent to practice as registered nurses upon completion.

For people who can and choose to finish with an Honours degree, they embark on a year-long research project usually in their area of interest. Faculty staff members and hospital staff will act as mentors for these projects. Some examples of research projects can be found here: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf)

***Difference between honors and without honors:***

* Basic monthly starting pay for some hospitals are different, may vary from $50-100 according the the annual graduate employment survey here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)
* Some overseas masters/PhD programmes require either an honours degree (directly)  or a normal bachelor’s degree with at least a few years of clinical experience
* Some hospitals/employers may view an honours degree more favourably in terms of salary and/or career progression

Complete information here on the NUS Nursing website, subject to changes every year: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/)

## Day-to-day lessons

Fun! We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins that can breathe and have pulses etc. We also have these people called standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills. They act like real patients with real symptoms and real family issues!

## Lectures and tutorials

Some lectures are video lectures - can watch at home at the pace you want! School is only around 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs. But of course, there are e-lectures to watch and tutorials to do and textbooks to read, so it’s not like you won’t have to do much studying outside those 2-4hrs/day. But if you manage your time well, it’s alright!

## For those worried about having no bio background:

There are people in Nursing who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and from poly who did non-science courses such as international business or mass communication.

The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don’t delve too deep into the molecules at all - that’s for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It’s hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries.

## For those scared of blood

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don’t look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some “science cadavers” to see what they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are scared of blood and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can’t be afraid of your own job.

## Lecturers/tutors

All teaching staff in ALCNS are previously doctors, nurses or pharmacists (for pharmacology). Usually, our heavily science-based modules are taught by previous doctors (eg: anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology), whereas more nursing-based modules are taught by previous or current nurses. This honestly helps a lot as our lecturers and tutors have had vast experiences in the clinical world, and therefore better able to relate what they teach with the clinical setting.

## Clinical placements

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards). But you will be reimbursed (paid) for the whole duration of placements!

## 1.2 Nursing degree vs diploma (polytechnic)

Main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around $800-1000 monthly, depending on the hospital (based on this [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278) and this [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)). You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last year, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about $3100-3300 a month on average (just refer to the MOE website above).

# 

# 2. NUS Nursing student life opportunities

## 2.1 Unrestricted Electives

You are required/allowed to take a minimum of 2 (for bachelor’s degree) or 3 (for honours degree) unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the nursing curriculum.

## 2.2 Local and Overseas Community Involvement Programmes

The Faculty of Medicine (Medicine and Nursing) has a lot of student-initiated CIPs both locally and overseas. You can join many things, from conducting free basic health checks in the neighbourhood, to volunteering with patients with dementia at a community hospital, to teaching basic first aid and english lessons to kids overseas - there’s really a lot of opportunities for us to give back to the community. Furthermore, you get to work with the medical students too as most of these projects are jointly planned and executed by both nursing and medicine students.

## 2.3 Student Leadership Opportunities

Similar to “student council” in secondary/JC, you can join the Nursing Subclub, Mednurse Club or SNASC to champion your peers’ causes and hopefully make a difference in their lives and in the profession of nursing. Other leadership opportunities include but not limited to: leading CIPs, organizing freshmen orientation, nurses’ day etc..

## 2.4 Exchange Programmes

ALCNS partners with several universities in different countries worldwide for student exchange programmes. Some countries include: Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, etc. The exchange programmes may occur during school time or vacation time, and usually lasts 1-4 weeks. Selection process is through application and is based on the student’s own merit (academic and portfolio, contribution to the school).

# 

# 3 Admission Information

## 3.1 Indicative Grade Profiles

## A Levels 2019

10th percentile: CCD/B

90th percentile: AAA/A

## Polytechnic GPA 2019

10th percentile: 3.33/4.0

90th percentile: 3.86/4.0

## 3.2 Admission Interviews

Not for everyone. Usually only done for people with rp near the cut-off point, to prove that you are not joining nursing purely because you can’t apply to any other course with your grades. This will weed out people who have absolutely no idea about nor passion for nursing. There are people who get in with lower rp than the IGP, but please put Nursing as 1st choice as that is a factor too. The format is somewhat like a panel interview, with 1 or 2 faculty members as your interviewers. 15-30min each.

## Tips

Be prepared but do not memorize a script. Just think through the usual interview questions and some of these additional questions below. I came up with this questions, it is in no way supposed to be representative of what the school will definitely ask. This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: Why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: What have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks and where you intend to go.

## 3.3 Scholarships

There are 2 kinds of “scholarships” - one is called MOH Scholarship and the other is called hospital sponsorship. The differences are below. There are also available financial help from NUS and ALCNS itself. Please refer to the NUS/ALCNS website for more information.

## MOH Scholarship

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (given in 6-monthly basis)
* PROS: money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get (requires excellent A Level grades (usually &amp;gt;85 rp from what I heard) and &amp;gt;4.0/5.0 CAP for mid-term scholarship.

## Hospital Sponsorships

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates want to work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, easier to get.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else, just monthly allowance

You don’t need to decide whether you want to take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they want to get sponsored by.

# 

# 4 Nature of Work

## 4.1 Job Scope

As for job scope, you go in as SN I as mentioned earlier, which is more senior than SN II, Enrolled Nurses, healthcare attendants, etc. The implication is that you will be usually the main person in charge of a cubicle, for example, with around 4-8 patients at any given time, updating the family members, doctors, other healthcare professionals.

## DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?

I love this question about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers MAY not be done (or not usually done) by staff nurses - it is usually done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses.

Staff nurses’ \*main\* roles are as follows:

1. Dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are THE EYES. IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. Side effects of medications. Psychological state. Family/patient concerns. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: “nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip???” - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Sometimes SNs may get assigned (or just do) the “cleaning” duties due to reasons such as understaffing or skin integrity assessment. That’s honestly good, to remain competent with basic nursing care of the patients such as helping with activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, etc).

## 4.2 Salary

Nursing is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market. 

As mentioned earlier, refer here: 

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)

## 4.3 Career progression

There are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take an advanced diploma or master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. 

They are: management, clinical and education tracks. 

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff problems etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinics in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds (must take extra course) without doctors. The only thing they cannot do will be surgery. 

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach. 

Occasionally, some people do clinical and education for example, this is called joint appointments. So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

# 5 Other common questions

## 5.1 Medicine vs nursing

**Know that: doctors cure, nurses care.** So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer for theory: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics, good enough to catch mistakes but not deep enough to the point that we are able to treat diseases with multiple complications for example!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look at the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children? What will the side effects of the meds/surgery be? Will he be able to cope?

So ask yourself, which role do you want to play?

## 5.2 Why NOT nursing?

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me want to turn away from Nursing. From my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly these:

1. You will inevitably get attached to some pts, especially if you work as a community hospital nurse where pts there stay for 3 months or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)
3. Nursing is an extremely tiring job, physically and emotionally. Be prepared to work long hours with limited time for your own needs such as food or even simply toileting. While it is my intention to elevate the profession of nursing by addressing stigmas, I do not intend to over glorify the profession and give everyone the false hope that nursing is very fun and easy. It takes real guts and strength to be a nurse, and you should only join if you think you are up for the challenge to learn and push yourself.

## 5.3 Overseas nursing

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a fresh grad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fast food meal in the US can easily cost $15. 

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

## 5.4 Dealing with deaths as a nurse

I haven’t personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals.

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

401,"[O Levels] 189 for PSLE, 12 raw for OLevel L1R4","Hello! I know getting a l1r4 12 raw for olevel may not be very good as there are way many more ppl getting single digit for r4 and even r5! But to me, I feel that my results are quite desirable and I’m happy with what I’ve achieved!
4 years ago, I got a 189 for psle but I wasn’t feeling dejected or disappointed(probably because I was still too young at the age of 12). I didn’t study for psle and I didn’t care about my results and how i‘ve fared for psle. I got a D for Science, C for English, C for Math and C for Chinese. Yes, I failed Science 😐 But I thought getting a 189 was good enough, until I realised that many doors were closed for express stream. A mere 188 is the least to achieve in order to get into an express stream in a neighbourhood secondary school. However, I was glad that I achieved 189 for psle, and not lower(if not unable to even get into express stream). I even selected the NA stream for some schools, just in case I couldn’t get into my first few express stream choices. I got into a neighbourhood secondary school(cop was 188). It was then I realised how badly I’ve fared for psle(when I started sec 1 and my friends started comparing psle results). My friends had close to 200, even some with 200+
Secondary school was a fresh start for me and I decided to work my ass off to achieve good grades for olevel. Despite failing Science in psle, I had the opportunity to take Pure Science during Sec 3, surprisingly! I knew things were gonna be difficult if I took double pure science, but I took up the challenge(pure phy and pure chem) and I’m glad I did! Although there were a few times I felt like giving up and dropping to combined science, I persevered through and WOW like I have never gotten a B for Pure Science before but shockingly in OLevel I did! From upper sec onwards, I had alot of tuition classes, like ALOT ! AMath, EMath, Pure Chem, Pure Physics, English, Chinese. My weekends were packed as heck(with classes starting as early as 9am and ending at 5pm on Saturdays). I had many sleepless nights in upper sec and I drank lots of coffee to keep myself awake. I would always stay up to revise especially when exams are on the next day. I know, this is my bad habit. I love to cram the night before and I even did so during the olevel period. But this was the only method that worked for me, so I had no choice. I stayed up for Common Tests, MYE, Prelims, and OLevel. I lost many hours of precious sleep but I tried my best to stay up only when necessary. I sat for Olevel in 2019 and when I received my results 2 months ago, I was shocked to see myself getting a 12 raw for r4 and 16 raw for r5. A1 for AMath, EMath, Chinese, C6 for English(HAHA but glad I didn’t fail though), B3 for Combined Humanities, B4 for Pure Chemistry. I decided to continue my education via the poly route and is currently waiting for poly semester 1 to start in April.
What I would like to say is that, psle grades don’t define you(maybe even olevel too). However, that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t put in hard work and not take exams seriously. A quote I live by especially during olevel period was: Work Hard, Play Hard. It is okay to rest and procrastinate for some days, I do as well! Everyone is a human being and we get tired on some days as well. Don’t drain yourself too early though(advisable to revise part by part) 
Always do and COMPLETE your TYS !! Review questions that you made a mistake, clarify and ask questions if you’re unsure, NEVER leave doubts !!! Thanks for reading till here. To all those who are taking Olevel this year, or the upcoming years, wish you all the best and believe in yourself! 💪🏻☺️",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fr1wsc/o_levels_189_for_psle_12_raw_for_olevel_l1r4/,True,2020-03-29 23:16:39

403,[polytechnic] laptop,"Hello all 

I understand quite a number of people ask about what laptop should get for poly. 

I will be giving some tips in this post. if you got further question can comment or PM me 

Macbook can or not 

* actually for my understanding macbook is use by design or media student however it is good to install an window OS partition in the macbook so that you can also use programs that only window can use 

What brand should I get for laptop 

* actually brand wise really depends on how you look at it. I am only giving recommendation base on my exp in IT sector (you can use it as an guide however please also google about that model and read review online) 
* HP laptop spoil easily however their after sale support is good (means the laptop support engineer will give better service and easier to make appt with them) please take note that sometime HP no spare part so you may need to wait awhile too. 
* Dell laptop is more durable (currently my personal laptop is dell and is with me for 6-7 years only battery spoil) after sale support is not so good (harder to make appt and most of the time spare part no stock need to wait awhile too) 
* please do not get acer laptop (generally in IT line we don't use this brand really cmi) even my seniors or boss tell me the same thing 

Buy from school or outside

* buy from school confirm will be slightly cheaper and give you 3 years warranty however they are older model 
* buy outside got more model to choose but more ex and you need to top up to get 3 years warranty usually outside offer 1 year warranty 

What specs should I get 

* I would say if non technical course you may consider to get i5 or i7 processor with 8GB ram. disk space 500GB can already. non technical course should not use heavy processing program therefore may not need alot of ram and disk space 
* for technical course please get i7 processor with 8GB ram (if can get 16GB ram best la) disk space 500 GB would be fine. technical course will use heavy processing program like vmare or programming software etc etc so more ram is needed 

*please check the detail of i5 and i7 processor that you are buying :) so that you know each one is better

Maintaining your laptop 

* please install antivirus in your laptop (you won't want to kena virus and all your school work all go missing or corrupted)
* please backup your file regularly if anything goes wrong you have a backup to restore (gt exp when my classmate when their pc crash due to hardware or software error)
* please do some house keeping on your laptop (Ccleaner or disk defragment) this is ensure that your laptop won't lag as sometime we keep junk file etc etc 

&#x200B;

404,[Rant] Parents getting in the way of education/life goals,"Going to be final year undergrad here. Yeah, you could say I’m old.

For a couple years I have wanted to go to Europe or the USA to pursue a PhD so that I can work in academia and research in the (rather specialized) field I’m interested in. I spent lots of time and effort on various research and now I have a nice beefy CV, good grades, good relationships with professors, etc. Then 2020 hit and now my parents (father specifically) say they will lock me in/confiscate passport if I insist on going overseas. My parents were never sold on the whole “I want a PhD” thing to begin with, but now they’re flat out objecting.

To be honest, I can see where they’re coming from. I get that they’re worried for my safety and don’t want me leaving this safe Singaporean bubble for a dangerous foreign land. And okay, getting a job as a research officer right after graduation is a viable option... but without the graduate qualifications, my career progression will be capped too. I could also do grad school in Singapore, but what would be the point of another 4-5 years in the same uni, doing the same things I’ve been doing for more than half of my undergraduate life?

I just feel like sometimes in life, we have to take a few risks to get what we want, and my parents need to understand that I don’t want to take a desk job in a bank or public service like what they expect.

I’m so lost right now and felt like needed to rant. Thanks for reading this",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gu7bp8/rant_parents_getting_in_the_way_of_educationlife/,True,2020-06-01 13:24:54
405,[Poly] [JC] Poly to JC AMA + Survival Guide,"TLDR: If you miss mugging and hate projects, go JC.

[Each year, 400 to 500 students make the switch from JC to poly, while merely 50 to 60 students do the reverse.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/switching-from-jc-to-polytechnic) Hence, those who may want to transfer from poly to JC may lack information on how to do so given how rare it is. Therefore, I'm starting an AMA for poly students who want to find out more about transferring to JC through the JAE. I will be replying to this thread until it eventually gets archived, and you can DM me your queries as well. But first, a few FAQs that I often received in my DMs, based on my experience. Do note that your transferring experience may differ from mine.

**How do you transfer from poly to JC?**

To start, let's split this process into two parts. Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Ideally, I recommend you to do it in order so that you won't be stuck in a place where you have no school to go to. You can also choose to forgo the second part and stay in JC and poly at the same time, but beyond a few weeks, attendance will tank, and you won't do well, of course.

Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Read page (iv) of the 2021 [JAE booklet](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/uploads/2021-JAE-Information-Booklet.pdf) for details on what exactly you should do, since your circumstances may be different from mine. For me, I took a few O-Level subjects as a private candidate, so I used my JAE PIN to log in. If you didn't take any subjects as a private candidate, you can still log in to the JAE system through SingPass, and apply using your previous year's O-Level subjects. If you are not applying through SingPass or didn't take O-Levels, the process is more tricky and beyond my scope of knowledge, so refer to the flowchart in the booklet above for more information. As for the JAE portal where you apply for your 12 choices, [this is likely how the portal will look.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAUla41WVfcxOrNl1HTNMPCYoM7tDIfA/view?usp=sharing) Choose your schools pragmatically and realistically based on past-year JC cutoff points. I have been posted to poly in some previous year, so I cannot select any poly courses and can only choose between JC and ITE options.

Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Consult your poly mentor about it, as I believe the withdrawal process may be different depending on the school you are in. There will likely be a withdrawal form which you should fill in advance, and it probably requires your parents' signature. I recommend arranging your withdrawal meetup with your course mentor a few days after the start of orientation, once you are comfortable with your new environment. For me, the withdrawal process was quick and finished in only 20 minutes, where my mentor helped to complete some course counselling form to ensure that I am dropping out for the right reasons. I just had to submit the withdrawal form, a printed screenshot of the JAE posting SMS, and my poly access card and was gone for good. However, the process may be different depending on whichever faculty or polytechnic you are in, and your parents may need to come down, though my parents did not come to the school for my case.

**Is it worth it to transfer from poly to JC?**

Well, that depends on your situation. For me, I had no regrets, and it was worth it. There are a few reasons why you should, and the same goes to why you shouldn't.

**Projects**

Sure, H1 Project Work is still a compulsory subject in JC. However, there are way fewer projects to handle than in poly. The project hell season can get debilitating to cope with at times as you rush stuff before the deadlines. Much of the grade is not only determined by how hard you work but the groupmates you choose or are assigned to. If you are drained out about trying to carry groupmates, and prefer to get assessed the more meritocratic way, where your work and yours alone determine your grades, JC is undoubtedly a better way to go.

**Academics**

By transferring to JC, you will likely be widening the possible options for your university education. Your grades are decided once and for all by a high stakes examination, rather than your cumulative regular performances. If you are aiming for a competitive university course, this could be a less stressful way of handling things, as you know that typical screw-ups during your time in JC do not count in your final grade like in poly. You have that room for improvement and screwing up. Subject contents are taught in a more rigorous manner, which means that while you have to apply what you learn to a higher level in JC, you also get to be more familiar with such concepts. Since there is a strictly defined syllabus that is publicly available of [SEAB website](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2021) for you to look at, there may be fewer things to learn; you don't have to worry about learning beyond the syllabus since it will not be tested. From my experience in poly, some higher-level contents are often taught without understanding the fundamentals, making things overwhelming. This may mean that when you go to JC, some content may feel familiar, and some parts of a subject may, surprisingly, be easy for you.

**Money**

For me, the transfer was worth it because it saved my parents money, and it saved me time. Unless you as a poly student are aiming for RI, HCI, ACSI, or SJI, in which case school fees would be more expensive, the transfer from poly to JC would mean a much lower school fee, from [$250 a month](https://www.np.edu.sg/admissions/Pages/coursefees.aspx) to [$33 a month](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-university). That's a lot of money saved, and during this pandemic-induced financial crisis, it could lift a huge burden off your parent's shoulders if you are not on a bursary. If you are on a bursary, well, you likely wouldn't have to pay it back, fortunately.

**Time**

As for time saved, going to JC means that you will graduate from this education level about 4 months before your poly friends do. For boys, your NS deferment ends 4 months earlier (from April to December the previous year). Of course, they have a certificate that makes them employable, while you only have one for university, but if the goal is to get to university, it can be worth it. Naysayers will nag over the wasted $3000 you spent in poly, and that you took 1 additional year to finish JC education, but compared to your current situation, you might still be better off. If you have traditional Asian parents, well that may potentially be that one thing that they could brag about at the next reunion dinner.

**Environment**

It is worth acknowledging that, given the lower school fees, the JC environment will not be as excellent as what poly has to offer. There should be air-conditioning in your classrooms, so that is going to be a step up from secondary school, but your canteens will not have air-conditioning, which may be a factor which you should take note of since polytechnic food courts have such air-conditioning. For my JC, the library is much smaller than the one from my poly. It is probably unable to handle the large populations of students, and worse still, is currently closed off as a makeshift staff room for teachers, so there isn't a conducive, air-conditioned space to study.

**Commitment**

Of course, do not go into JC with the thinking that it is easier than in poly and you can slack off. I mean, teachers do chase after students for homework in JC, unlike in poly where you get worse grades. However, much of the non-tutorial work comes in optional revision sets. It is in your best interest to do them if you want to maintain a consistent, exemplary performance so that you will not struggle later on in your JC life, or risk being in the 5% of the cohort who retains, since you would've already ""retained"" once. Assuming you make full use of the JC experience, the mix of CCAs and other non-academic stuff like internships will keep you occupied during the much-shorter school holidays. Hence, there's a lot less time for you to pursue leisure during the holidays as compared to in poly, where you can easily find time to work and let your brain rot. 

**Readiness**

Finally, it would be best if you read through the syllabi of the subject combination you intend to take beforehand, to make sure you will enjoy what you will be studying so that you will not suffer in JC. Maybe leverage off the content you learn in poly, and take some subjects that have the content overlap, so that you have a more comfortable life coping with the JC curriculum. You should also ask yourself if you enjoy the JC kind of mugging and writing, and have the motivation to do consistently throughout these two years so that you will be better off than staying in poly. Otherwise, this transfer from poly to JC will probably not be worth it.

**I've spent one year in poly and forgot all my O-Levels stuff already. Can I still do well in JC?**

Yes, you can still do well in JC. For me, I've done pretty well in all my subjects for promotional examinations, with around half my subjects scoring As, and half my subjects scoring Bs – good enough for me to qualify for an H3 subject. Of course, I wouldn't know for sure until I get my A-Levels results, so I got to stay consistent with my studies. Anyways, even if you haven't touched your O-Levels fundamentals for a year, with enough effort, a consistent motivation to study, and a thoughtful selection of subject combinations, you can do well in JC. Just make sure you understand whatever that is taught by the time your tutorials finished so that you will not suffer later on as the content builds upon what was taught previously.

409,[Rant] Unsuccessful,"[Rant] The one word that perfectly sums up my life : Unsuccessful. Unsuccessful family relations, unsuccesful friendships, unsuccessful aspirations, unsuccessful work relations...

Feeling especially disappointed with myself as of late for being rather incompetent, for being unable to be in control of my predicament and also my feelings (its overwhelming). I have always treated others with sincerity and kindness, yet these yielded hate and betrayal. I give others who I know my all, but they never see it, or just feign ignorance. I have had great aspirations as well and worked hard to achieve it, but guess I dont have the aptitude to dream big. I treat my coworker with respect and help her in whatever that is within my means, however she just shouts at me whenever she feels like it, and when its just the 2 of us.

Inspite of all these, and the fact that I constantly tell myself not to try so hard, I cant... Its just an innate response to give it my all. Hopefully alls well for everyone else.

413,[A Levels] [O Levels] Some final words of encouragement...,"Hiya!

&#x200B;

Some of y'all may remember me as one of the co-writers of the 2-part PCME study guide posted here a while back *(if haven't seen them yet, they're pinned under my profile!)*. Don't worry, I'm not going to talk any more about PCME, I'm done with that. I'm here with some final words of encouragement for all of you, yes including you O-Level kiddos. These are more... intangible things? that I have learned from my experience at A's. I've tried to write in a more narrative way to make it easier to read through, but I apologise in advance if I made you cringe instead of feeling better! Here goes...

&#x200B;

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

&#x200B;

1. You don’t have to shoulder this alone

During this stressful lead-up to the exams, it’s all too easy to lose sight of the people around you. Every fact, statistic or formula you remember displaces from your memory a friend in need or a shoulder you can lean on. You forget that your friends are struggling alongside you, that tens of thousands of other students are fighting your same battle, and that you are not alone.

As you continue preparing for the exams, do remember to check on the people you care for.

Be generous and forthcoming with your guidance, because every little gesture goes a long way in an environment where everyone is fixated on their own outcomes. Plus, teaching others is one of the best ways of revising, so what you have is really just a win-win situation.

Do not be afraid to reach out for help, because most people will be glad to lend a helping hand.  If it seems like people are reluctant, chances are it’s because your own needs become less salient when everyone else is facing similar problems. They get stressed and have bad days too, just like us. Be patient and forgiving, and never close yourself off.

Even if it may not feel like it, you do have people around you. It doesn’t matter if it’s family, friends, teachers, a significant other, or other SGExams users in the same boat as you. As you continue cramming your head with information, remember to vacate some space for these people that you care about. You don’t have to shoulder all this weight alone.

&#x200B;

2. Let it unravel before you

If you are like me, you must be familiar with the episodes of crippling anxiety when the entire combined weight of the futility of your two years (or four years for O-levels) of hard work, the impossibility of the exams, and the hopelessness of your near future seem to be pressing down on you all at once. And you probably also know that these episodes are *not fun.*

Though, there is something I’ve realised during some of my darkest times:

There are certain things we can control, and for every one thing we can control, there are many more things that we cannot. Acknowledge and accept your fears; they are completely valid. Once you have accepted them, though, you have to loosen your grasp on them and let them go.

Maybe you just don’t have enough time to complete your revision. Maybe the dreaded insomnia sneaks up on you and your mind goes completely blank during your best paper. Maybe you won’t get your desired grades, let alone your dream University (or school).

All the worries in your head are not unfounded and you are justified in feeling the way you do, but also realise that these things are well beyond your control. Mulling over them will only cloud your vision and prevent you from performing at your complete, unbridled best.

If you shift your focus to the things that are within your control, like how productive you are or how much sleep you get each day, everything becomes more manageable. You’d be surprised at how much progress you can make once you give these controllable factors your undivided attention.

During these moments when you are at your lowest, let everything you’ve painstakingly woven together unravel slowly before you. Let your efforts go to waste. Let the dreaded days come and go. Let what you are most afraid of wash over and engulf you, and emerge renewed from it.  “Come what may”, or... something like that.

&#x200B;

3. Do not go down without a fight

*“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.”*

So what if you have been procrastinating a lot? If people have already started way before you and it seems like you’re late? You may have missed that proverbial “best time to plant a tree”, and each passing day you delay your starting is another missed opportunity, but the fact remains that the *next best time* is the present. In times like these when you don’t have much of a choice, the second-best option seems pretty appealing.

*“Do not go gentle into that good night.”*

In exams, we are often unsure of our answers, and it would take an unlimited number of second-guesses, or the running out of prescribed exam time - whichever comes first - to force us to make a decision. Other times, the only thing that we are certain of is that we are *completely* and *utterly screwed*, and that no amount of divine intervention can save us.

Even if you know for a fact that everything is going down in flames, you do not go down without a fight. Sometimes, the more convinced you are of your failure, the more you struggle against it. You will fight down to your last breath, because it is better to do so than to give in sheepishly and let all your years of hard work dissolve before you.

Two things define us: one, the unrelenting courage to take what we perceive to be a lost fight straight on; and two, the dogged defiance we show in the face of an inevitability.

It doesn’t matter how little time you have left, or what mountainous tasks lie ahead of you. If you start now and give it your all, you should be proud of yourself regardless of the outcome, because you have shown that unique tenacity which makes us human.

There is no “lost cause” or “foregone conclusion” when you are still fighting. The eventual outcomes are uncontrollables. What you can control is whether you go gently into the good night, or rage against it.

*“Lose the battle, win the war.”*

A short but necessary disclaimer: there are times when you have to take your losses and give in. Know your limits - there are certain fundamental, inviolable “rights” that every pitiable student reserves, namely to sleep and to take a break when needed. If you are tired from studying, order a retreat and head to bed, and continue the battle the next day. If you burn out, embrace your loss graciously, take a well-deserved break and have some fun, and then resume the campaign once your fire has rekindled. When it comes to the long haul, though, you give nothing short of your very best.

&#x200B;

4. Fake it till you make it

It’s difficult to be confident when you feel like you’re the only one flailing about the water while everyone else effortlessly remains afloat. You have somehow fallen off an unsinkable ship while the rest on board continue merrily on their journey.

I can ask you to be confident in yourself, but “easier said than done” would be a massive understatement here. How can you be confident when you’ve been failing all along? When everything you do turns out to be a mistake? When your classmates or friends outperform you at virtually everything that can be compared?

Sometimes, the only way to be confident is to fake it till you make it. Quite literally, you pretend that you are confident, and act exactly like how a confident person would. Yes, this sounds like a steaming pile of bullshit, but hear me out:

Tell yourself each day that you can make it, even if these blatant lies leave a bitter aftertaste in your mouth. Stop asking around and comparing your grades or answers with others, and be certain of your own abilities, even if you know for sure that comparing would reveal your inferiority. Walk into the exam hall with your head held high and shoulders squared, even if you feel like the least prepared person in that hall.

Over time, this false confidence becomes an acquired habit, and something you can call your own. It’s weird, but it’s much easier to develop confidence intrinsically once doing “confident things” has become second nature.

You are not someone who has fallen off the ship; you are your own vessel carving your own path through the waves. You are still perfectly fine even if everyone else has given up on you, because the most important person is yourself: you are the only constant among many variables as you face different adversities in life. The day that you forsake yourself is the day that you lose your best friend and your voice.

Let your self-confidence outshine the combined disapproval and scepticism of your non-believers. You can go farther than you can ever imagine; much, much farther than your wildest dreams.

&#x200B;

5. Tara Westover’s story

This is less of something I’ve learned from experience and more of an inspiring story I had recently come across and wanted to share. It also ties in nicely with what I have written so far.

Tara Westover, author of the bestseller “Educated”, grew up in rural, survivalist Idaho (a state in the U.S.) in a family that was fanatically religious. They were sceptical and even fearful of institutions that run contrary to their beliefs, like the government, hospitals, or public schools. Her delusional parents would do absurd things like refusing to send her siblings to hospital even when they were seriously injured, instead opting to “heal” them with essential oils; and stocking up food and weapons in preparation for the “end of the world” as prophesied by their religion.

As part of their unorthodox parenting, she was homeschooled from young, and had to self-study for the ACT to get into a public college. She set foot in her first-ever classroom at the age of **17**. Naturally, it was an uphill struggle - she had to manage both her finances and studies while grappling with her gradual distancing from her family, both in trust and ideology. It was not smooth-sailing at all, and I really don’t know how she did it - maybe it was the resilience she developed growing up in a difficult household, or the timely help and guidance of several important people in her life - but she managed to outdo herself by graduating from college, and eventually getting a PhD from Cambridge (she had a brief stint in Harvard University as well).

I find Tara’s story particularly inspiring because it shows that even someone with such a late start can go so far. Seeing the long and rocky journey she had to take to educate herself about the outside world beyond her sheltered, distorted childhood reminds me that big changes only happen in small steps, and that there is always a way up no matter how many times you have fallen. If you ever feel like you are too old to learn something new, or - more relevant for us right now - that it is too late to start preparing for your exams, let her story be that quiet voice that tells you in your head that no, it’s not too late, it’s never too late, and everything that you do from today onwards will be completely worth it in the end.

As a side note, once your exams are over, I would highly recommend her book “Educated”. I don’t know how else to describe her writing besides “beautiful”, and it’s also written with so much sincerity and vulnerability that I could not get over her story for many days.

If you have made it to the end, thank you! I know it may sound all solemn and gloomy, and y’all probably feel extra bad with Covid and all, but cheer up! Remember that there’s a whole world waiting for you post-A’s (or O’s). There’s always light at the tunnel, and soon you can breathe freely again (still with a mask on, though). And no matter how things turn out, always keep your head held high. Be proud of yourself, because I’m proud of you too!

414,[O levels] study tips!,"Finally. we’ve all studied for 4(+) years just for this exam. O levels is coming up and this is our final lap! i know many of you are disappointed about your prelim results but just remember that your prelim results are not indicative of your O level results! seriously, there are students that received F9s for prelims but still managed to obtain B3s or even As for O’s! it’s definitely possible. having a mentality shift is the first step, u have to believe in yourself.
we have about a month ish so right now staying consistent is definitely key! however, remember that you shouldn’t overwork yourself. studying long hours without any breaks just calls for disaster. please get enough sleep too! sleep is very important now. make sure you’re drinking enough water & eating your 3 meals (& snacks) a day!! take care of yourselves please :,) 

here are some study tips i personally use:

1) active recall flashcards! 
- very useful in helping you retain information as it forces your brain to think of the answer
- better for definition type questions

how do i make the flashcards?
write your answer on one side of the flash card & write the same thing on the other side but with blanks for the key words. everyday, try to fill up the blanks in your head or say it out loud w/o refering to the back. 

2) to do list instead of timetable

i don’t know if it’s just me but i can’t really follow a timetable HAHAHA so instead, i make a to do list for the day. (unless you’re doing timed practices) and i make them realistic because i know i wont be able to do 5 papers a day so i usually just do 1 or 2 ++ revise on certain topics. also i believe that completing a set of work is better than studying for an allocated time slot but ofc you do you!

3) papers!!!!!!

do ALL your papers!!! prelim papers are normally harder than O level papers but of course it varies from school to school. honestly, just do a lot of papers but CHECK and mark your work. redo those that you got wrong. expose yourself to more questions! 

there are many resources such as zookal.com , smartguppy.com and the sgexams one! youtube has many explanations for O level a math papers and even chemistry practicals! (combined & pure i believe) 

forest is also a really good app! but i think you need to pay for the app, if anyone has a free version please leave it in the comments!!

all the best peopleee! rmb, ur mental health takes priority over anything! take breaks and don’t overdo yourself. <33",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iv3e47/o_levels_study_tips/,True,2020-09-19 02:12:15

416,[Uni] Mid-term scholars experience,"Hi! The deadline for uni acceptance for the first window is coming and its very likely that universities will stop/have stopped issuing scholarship offers so people are looking towards mid-term ones.

I wanted to ask if anyone who are/tried to be mid-term scholars a few questions! 

1) which scholarship did you apply for? (Uni/private/public)

2) what were your grades and portfolio like in uni when you applied for the mid-term scholarship? (I know each scholarship has their own criteria and do list them but i wanted a more realistic gauge of what a mid-term scholar looks like) 

3) did you apply for the full term ones beforehand? what were your grades and portfolio like prior to uni? 

Feel free to share more about your experience! I'm sure it would benefit a lot of us who are curious and want to work towards a mid-term scholarship!

Edit : i dont know if the lack of responses from mid-term scholars is due to 1) them not seeing this, 2) them not being comfortable/willing to share or 3) that there are hardly any mid-term scholars which is very T-T",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/goboub/uni_midterm_scholars_experience/,True,2020-05-22 19:28:04
417,[rant] stresssed about receiving o level results,"(throwaway account) hey. so november is coming to an end. the results are going to be returned in abt a month or so and i can feel my anxiety spiking. i wish i could say that i'm excited to receive them bc i put in all that time/effort blah blah but i honestly don't feel like i studied enough to enter my top choices (for both schools and courses) and that i should probably start considering my actual options. ideally i would get a good L1R5 and go off to some atas jc (not like RI standards though 🥴). (if i could enter asrjc i'd prly get on my knees bang my head on the floor and say thank you to whichever god helped me.) i'm just wondering if anyone else is feeling the same way and if any seniors who ended up getting a disappointing result could drop some advice abt which school you went to and, if you went to poly, which course you took? do you enjoy it? i feel like an oral examiner haha. but i would genuinely appreciate any words be it of comfort or criticism because i just need someone to talk to. 

(i'm just going to be rambling from here onwards for the word count. ) i know people say o levels isn't the end and i do agree (to a certain extent bc there are always other academic hurdles in life), but the fact remains that it is a large factor in determining your future career/life/mental state. okay i'm tired of typing now. i hope no one recognises me that would be ✨embarrassing✨. hope you guys are doing well!

418,[Job] sharing my life exp/study life,"Hello all :)

I just would like to update my pervious post which I share about 6 mths ago as I would like to add on about my job experience after taking a diploma and even as a diploma holder as long you work hard you can do well :)

Just want to share my exp since my N level days

When pass N level then go sec 5 steady la! No problem can go poly worse can RP only ma. the actual reason why I decide to go sec 5 is because keeping a promise to a lady who I date in sec 3 which is to take O level with her (moral of the story don't let a relationship ruin your future and I learn it the hard way!)

In the end when I get my O level result. No. I get D7 for Eng and Math. I ask my sec sch if I can retain and take my O level and they say no and ask me go ITE. Nobody was really there for me so I just lock myself in my room and choose some ITE course. fyi I am the 5% in my sec 5 cohort to go ITE while 5% go JC and 90% poly so you can roughly feel how sad I was back then. I prove my secondary school wrong by bring my poly grad grown back to take photo with some of my secondary school teacher who support me always

ITE become the best 2 years in my study life. Have to admit that my ITE teachers took some effort to pull me back to the right track(I given up on life because I feel very demoralized. Special thanks to Teacher A in ITE who always give me a listening ear and allowing me to attend his math lesson even he is not teaching my class and even take time to give me 1 to 1 lesson if I need help in any modules. In between I was fighting a tough battle against my depression because I care so much how people look at me and result in mental breakdown. I do really hope that you all can have this mindset that everybody say you cmi but u cannot give up on yourself!

managed to graduate in ITE with a gpa of 3.9 and was 2nd in cohort

Diploma 3 years program was not easy for me. Struggling in report writing (eng not good and poly lecturer say my eng like sec sch cmi) and math. Everything is so fast pace to me. In the end manage to get a good score and graduate. finally understand why teacher A challenge me to go SP because he knew I can survive well in SP and he was right I graduate with a gpa of 3.225

Fast forward to NS finish then look for job. Was surprise that when I go interview nobody ask me to show my N and O level even I bring along. Only to see my ITE and poly result slip and cert. Now working full time in a cyber security company.

Currently is about 2.5 years since I work for my company already and I am now officially an acting senior where I have handle daily to daily operation when my team lead and asst team lead is busy. if things are smooth I will be promoted by 1st half next year and I am going to be train up as an asst team lead

my job scope currently is as following (not always I do all but usually about 2-3 roles)

Internal Support

* Asset Management
* AD management
* repair laptops

Level 2 Engineer

* on-site /remote support
* know how to handle break-fix related issue

Duty Engineer

* to ensure that if customer call in after office hour will response and help them if got issue
* handing over ticket to the next available engineer in the event that you finish night job due to the customer

Deployment Engineer

* deployed a new setup in customer place
* doing migration if needed
* any job that is not under break-fix scope

future plan wise I would like to take up adv diploma in network security with SP to increase my knowledge in cyber security field and take more certification like Cisco. I would hope that in time to come I will be promoted to a full engineer.

here are some tips that and links I would like to share :)

in summary

* longer route sure very sian but if you determined and hang on sure reach your dream one day!
* later bloomer is okay don't give up yourself! :)
* maybe you are just more hands on like me
* I fought very hard to get what I want to do in life (actually my ITE and poly course is not 100% I interested one but in the end I still manage to find a job which I want to do and deepen my skill) if you have a goal and set liao just go for it!
* I feel that hands - on experience and having skillset also aid you to put food on the table (I am earning above ave if you want to compare with a diploma grad)

421,3 Simple Steps to Improve GP Content Knowledge [A Levels],"**How to Improve GP Content Knowledge? (R.E.C Method)**

Hey all, i am back again this year with a new article! I **used this when i was a student and i found it really helpful**, so i wish to share it with you guys. As usual, you can [**read the full article here**](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/how-to-improve-gp-content-knowledge-r-e-c-method/) if you want to see some examples and memes!

If you have been wondering how to **improve content knowledge or** why **readings tons of news articles** hasn't been effective for you, this is the right article for you!

To begin, we need to first understand how to **translate current affairs knowledge into actual content** that can be incorporated into essay writing. Many students I know dedicate a lot of time **reading news almost every other day but they still do not perform well in GP**.

The reason is simple. They are unable to apply this knowledge into their writing. Reading widely can give you a lot of information about the world, but it can also overwhelm you such that nothing really comes to mind in the exams. The trick is to find a way to **structure all these different issues you read** about.

What better way to structure than to use the [**7 major topics of GP?**](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/7-major-topics-for-gp-essays-compiled-past-year-prelim-a-levels-essay-questions/) Click on the link for details but for a quick refresher, the topics are: **Science, Arts, Politics, Media, Environment, General, Individual**

In 3 simple steps, you can use the **R.E.C method: Read, Extract Classify.** Use R.E.C when you wish to read new articles to add to your knowledge!

## 1. Read (Facts)

Notice that **reading isn't the ONLY step** you need to have to improve content. Many students believe that religiously reading an article every day without fail would be the secret to doing well for GP. The truth it that **often doesn't work out** as expected.

Students would still find themselves **struggling to generate relevant points for the essay question** in the exam. They roughly remember what they have read but forget some details along the way and simply don't have enough examples for one question.

The reason is simple, because the question in GP is often focused on 1 or 2 topics. The challenge is to distill everything you have read into one single essay. Having a lot of knowledge is awesome, but you **need to know how to apply that knowledge**, how to **translate it into something useful**. Hence, reading is merely step 1 and there are two more steps that follow.

What you should be doing in this step is of course to **understand the article and extract some useful facts** that will help you recall this example or event easily. Read the article and as you read, start **taking note of some key facts** that define the incident. You can either highlight, underline or simply write them down.

The important thing here is to simply **grasp the situation** and get an accurate sense of what has happened. You **don't want to extract every single fact**, just pick what you think may be useful in your essay.

## 2. Extract (Arguments/Points)

In this step, you will start thinking about what are the **potential issues, questions or arguments** found in this situation. Realise that this step is also exactly what you are required to do for compre. To do well for compre, you need to be able to **accurately pinpoint the author's arguments**.

It will **help you not only for AQ, but also for summary and SAQ** because when you identify the arguments, you begin to have a lot more **clarity for the entire passage**. You start to see what the **author's stand** is, what **reasons he/she uses to support his/her assertions**, what **examples are chosen to specifically illustrate**, what **counter-arguments are being rebutted**, what **comparisons are made to emphasise** a point etc.

Some articles you read are quite factual (only describing the event rather than forming any judgement), but you should think about the issue and **ask yourself what are some points of tension**. **TENSION is an important word here**. Where is the tension, who are the parties involved in this tension? There will always be tension in every issue. **Tension exists when there are differing opinions** to an issue.

Understanding the different arguments present would allow you to **dig deeper at an issue**, to **go beyond just facts** and really glean what the whole issue is about and what the **significance** of it is. Once you see the different arguments, you can then proceed with the next step to link these arguments to potential GP topics.

## 3. Classify (Link to Topic)

This is the **most important step** in ensuring that you have actually **value-added to your content repository**. You **MUST think about how you can apply that content to an essay question or topics**. Doing this will also help enhance the knowledge within you.

At this point i am sure you will realise that **quality is as important as quantity**. Readings a news article each day is great but you must accompany that with close analysis. To be honest, you don't have to read that many articles. It is probably a lot more helpful for you to **be more selective in which articles you read and how you can apply them**.

In this step, from the tensions generated in step 2, you can proceed to think about essay questions. Basically, after you obtained the facts and pick out the tensions, you need to **link to potential topics** and you can easily do that through thinking about some common questions found in GP. If you don't have a list of questions, you may [click here](https://www.gptuition-zascension.com/7-major-topics-for-gp-essays-compiled-past-year-prelim-a-levels-essay-questions/).

Completing this step would means that you can give yourself a pat on the back. You have successfully added to your content knowledge and acquired a new example or argument that you can use in an essay question. You can **imagine the power of R.E.C if you repeat this for the same topic**. After just one month, you could even become an **expert for the topic of environment!**

So start thinking about what topics interest you, and go out there now to R.E.C some articles!

422,[O Levels] Results.,"Hello:) Results are gonna be out in another ~~2 months~~ sorry wait 4-5 DAYS WHAT. i've been worrying NONSTOP. Results are on my mind 24/7 and I am really scared because I need to make it into a jc..in the science stream to be exact. I also have back-up plans and all but i'm not sure if my dad approves of sending me abroad for my education yk. To sum it all up, I'm just really anxious for my results. My prep was pretty last minute and all but ig i still managed to do the papers well. Okay okay this is getting TOOO long...Let me just cut to the chase. I was scrolling thru all the posts here in this community and most of them are about results day and some even mentioning in their posts on how they performed in the various papers they completed a solid 2 months back LMAOOOO...The results are decided alr + its no point tryna say how you did your papers because ITS OVER. I just wanna say PLEASE STOP WORRYING ABOUT THE RESULTS!! What's done is done and nothing can really be changed now. Your results can either reflect your hardwork or make you learn a lesson that will stick with you throughout your life ,and probably even benefit you. Its no point worrying about it; Just enjoy right now and be in the moment. You don't wanna live in the future twice (if you get what i'm saying). The results aren't the end of anything. If you feel that you've done bad or anythg, just take it as a harsh learning lesson that next time you must put in twice as much as hardwork, and that you need to be consistent in your work wherever you go beit jc/poly/IB (or wherever you intend to go). All the best and please please **PLEASE** stop worrying!! It isn't gonna do you any good! Go for a run/jog, watch the sunrise/sunset, and do things you enjoy:) Binge watch as **MANY** movies as you want because you don't wanna regret not having done that 2-3 months ahead of now:)

425,[O Levels] To all those EAE Applicants💌,"Yesterday was the release of the EAE results, some made it, but sadly some didn't.

Some may feel super demoralized and sad, be it because their friends made it or because the cut-off point is too low for them, disappointment from themselves and/or loved ones, or some will just start to work hard for their o's to enter their desired course via JAE.

On the other hand, some may be extremely happy that they got an offer, while some may not get their first choice and/or wondering whether they should accept the offer.

Whatever the case, this is not the end yet.

If you had an offer and accepted it, I'm really happy for you. Really. \*virtual hugs\* But you still have to meet the requirements! Keep that in mind and don't lose the opportunity! You got this! Jiayou!

For those on the other side, I believe in you. YOU CAN DO IT. Really. Don't doubt yourself, don't limit yourself. Don't think that you can only get this certain amount of points and can never get into the course or whatsoever. I believe you can get more than that. It's all in the mind. If I say you can do it and you tell yourself you can, that means you can. Nothing else. If you want to get into the course so much, you would have found every way just to go in, not sit here and stressing about it. You may have lost your pathway, but you can build one yourself. Time may seem short rn but nothing is impossible. Chiong ah!

Oh yeah, don't care about all those comments and stuff that demoralize you, Cannot make it? Do it, Prove it, doitproveitdoitproveit. (Yes it's Youth with You 2 ref) Go prove them wrong.😉I believe in you, so must believe in yourself also. \*hugs\*

And those who got an offer but still hesitating, take your time to figure it out, think of why you want to apply in the first place, and about the process. You've gone through so much, and now that you have an offer, do you still want the course just like how you want it initially? Does the course still speak to you? Or if you expect another course to accept you but didn't, there are a lot to think of also, eg. Am I really ok with this option? Am I willing to work extra hard enough if I reject it? Whether you accept it eventually or not, leave no regrets.

But anyways, whatever the results, whatever that has already happened, don't be too complacent, don't be too disappointed, we are in this together. All the best for O's! 💪

>!P.S. Some PERSONAL advice here, If your course has a common (be it engineering, business, ICT) programme, and that course's cut-off point is higher than that specific course you are going for and it's within reach, go for the common programme. Then work super hard to go in your course. Might be risky, so do it at your own risk, huehue. !<",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iop46f/o_levels_to_all_those_eae_applicants/,True,2020-09-08 23:11:44
426,[Rant]Do you guys experience this?,"From sec school and even till uni, whenever i am sleep deprived, i feel sleepy during lessons and start to nod off. This isn't suprising, but whenever the teacher says ""let's take a break"" or ends the class, i literally perk up instantly. Like my sleepiness and groginess just suddenly goes away. I can't even fall asleep or take a short nap even if i wanted to during this period. But when the lesson resumes, my sleepiness kicks back in and i start to nod off again.

427,[O levels] My Goals,"I didn't perform well for Prelims, and I don't really have the motivation to do anything. How am I supposed to pull my grades up in 2 weeks?

Whatever, I am going to try the impossible.

With Chinese (I've got B3) out of the question, these are my Prelim Grades:

1. Amath F9 (Imporved by 1% since last year)
Possible reason: I completely forgot my formulas, my mind went COMPLETELY BLANK - not enough practice

2. EMath B3 (improved 5 grades)
Possible reason: I didn't do polygon questions, didn't check paper thoroughly for any calculation mistakes, wrong angle property used - not enough practice

3. Chemistry D7 (improved 2 grades)
Possible reason: didn't finish chem paper 2, failed chem paper 1 - time management + understanding of concepts not there yet

4. Biology C6 (improved 3 grades)
Possible reason: Paper 2 failed, can't answer qns fully, always missing keywords here and there - not enough practice

5. English B3 (dropped 1 grade)
Possible reason: messed up paper 1, didn't choose correct questions to do - must remember to link to qn and not ramble on and on

6. Literature B4 (dropped 3 grades)
Possible reason: never link to question + give sufficient quotes - MEMORIZE QUOTES

7. SS, History D7 (dropped 4 grades)
Possible reason: I've got a 49%. I failed History badly because I couldn't finish half of the paper + rushing very badly - MEMORIZE notes !!!! 

L1R4 - 16
L1R5 - 26 

I hope to get these grades for O Levels:

1. AMath B3
2. EMath A2
3. Chemistry B3
4. Biology A2
5. English A1
6. Literature A1
7. SS, History A1

L1R4 - 7
L1R5 - 10

I want to get into a polytechnic course that is based on mass communication/story telling. I couldn't get into the course via EAE, but I made a promise to myself to get into there no matter what. The course has no cut off points since it was recently established.

428,[UNI] HELP I'm poor,"Hi sorry about the title lmaooo but it honestly perfectly encapsulates what I'm about to say

So the deal is that I'm really poor; my household's per capita income is below $600, and because of the way life wants to fk everyone up, all 3 siblings (including myself) are matriculating into university this year. 

Great.

It would not be that big of a deal if we were Singaporeans. Our income qualifies us for A LOT of bursaries that cover full tuition, some even including a living allowance. Life would be all fine and dandy since the government has our asses covered. 

Unfortunately, we're PRs. 

That leaves us out of most bursaries, and we're not smart enough to get a school scholarship. (Our RP averages at about 87.5, but my brothers and I are matriculating into CS and law respectively, where our scores are not enough to get a scholarship.) External organisations are another option, but interviews are still ongoing and everything is very very uncertain.

I will be matriculating into SMU Law this year. The school fees would be about $1.5k A MONTH subsidised. (And that's on fees alone, not including books, living allowances, transport etc etc) 

I have scoured their website looking for bursaries, and the only one that I am eligible for is an SMU bursary that gives me about $1.5k a year. (SMU Access is only for SCs unfortunately.) While that would be tremendously helpful, it does mean that the bulk of my tuition fees would have to be loaned, and I will graduate law school saddled with debt, lel! 

I will definitely be working part time during the course of my degree, but given how rigorous the law curriculum is, as well as how little part-timers generally earn, there is only so much I can do. I assume that I'll earn enough for my living expenses, but that's about it. 

So here is my cry for help: Is there any sort of financial assistance that I can apply for that can cover some part of my tuition? The amount doesn't have to be big, anything helps :')

EDIT: I don't think there's actually any other bursaries I can apply for; so instead I'll just take the loan, work part time, work hard and hope I get a mid term scholarship! Thanks for the help guys :)

EDIT 2: No one is probably gonna read this, but in case you're in the same situation as me, have faith! Managed to get a full scholarship for SMU Law :) If you ever want more details, just PM me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fyv0wd/uni_help_im_poor/,True,2020-04-11 18:50:50

431,“[O Levels] Tips for Humanities (SS + ELECT GEOG)”,"Tips for Humanities (SS + Elect Geog)

Took O Levels in 2019 so decided to share some tips (not sure if they will be useful for you).

SS:

The most difficult problem probably for everyone would be how to provide a higher level of response/answer to the question to score more marks. My tip would be for you to look at your answers and compare them to the answer/marking schemes that your SS teachers provide. Analyse the answer/marking schemes to see what you are lacking. Also, practice makes perfect. Not all PYPs in the SS Tys can be done as the current syllabus that we are studying has changed since 2/3 years ago. So, try to ask your teachers to see if they are able to provide SS papers from other schools for you to practice. Because it’s hard for you to mark your own SS papers unlike other subjects such as Math and Science which have straightforward answers, try to ask your SS teachers to see if they are willing to mark for you. I did a lot of practice papers and handed them in for my SS teacher to mark. Also, another that can be very confusing for students would be the question types and the different answer formats. Most SS teachers will probably tell you that for certain questions, it is not advisable to stick to an answer format and it’s best to be flexible. I agree with that but if you find yourself weak in this area, remembering a few answer formats would be good as well. 

Elect Geog:

Risky method so I won’t advise you to try. Really depends on that year’s paper and luck. Never have I been good at Weather&Climate + GI, Plate Tectonics, Volcanoes etc (Basically the entire Sec 3 Syllabus). But I’m quite strong in the Sec 4 Syllabus (Food & Tourism + Tourism GI). I focused 90% of my revision time on them, and only revised a little for my Sec 3 Topics. Was lucky enough. 2019’s paper had all the Sec 3 & 4 Topics separated for Section B & C so I could do questions that were plainly about Food&Tourism. For Section A, it’s clear cut. Two different types of GI questions ( Weather & Climate Data Gathering & Tourism GI). So choose the one that you are the most confident in and focus on that. 1 Less item for your revision too.

AND (MOST IMPORTANTLY):

If you have any doubts/questions/misunderstandings, clear/settle them at the very instance - book an appointment with your teacher or ask them immediately once the lesson ends. This helps to avoid the situation whereby all your doubts/questions/misunderstandings snowball and you get even more confused. Frequently consult your teachers if possible. Don’t leave everything hanging and unaddressed till your examination period nears. Many of my classmates like to be “last-minute” and only consult the teachers when an examination period nears.

For Humanities, get your content clear and organised right from the start. When you see your teacher for consultations at a later period, it should be about how to improve your answering techniques and refining your answers.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iefebh/o_levels_tips_for_humanities_ss_elect_geog/,True,2020-08-23 01:15:00
432,"[uni] life in universityTips, NUS FASS modules, student resources, modules","Since some camps are postponed, I hope to provide some tips if possible for juniors. feel free to ask any questions=)


1. Time management

I started working since year 1 of university so managing time well is exceptionally important. Every minute saved from each module makes a difference. Before class, I read the lecture notes (a quick scanning if time is tight is better than nothing). By having a rough idea of what will be covered during class b4hand, I can absorb the materials more easily as the professor teaches. Pay attention in class, so you know what questions you have. Ask these questions during the break or after class (There will be a couple of students doing that, so don’t worry). This helped me to save time because I can clear my questions instantly. I would have spend more time if I revisit the notes some time later to figure out the answers to my questions. Leave the figuring out part to tutorials - more efficient and effective. [Listen](https://bit.ly/2MNJfXJ) to some nice music while studying helps too

2. Proritise your work constantly with a to-do list. 

Time will pass real fast. Keep track of the assignments, and prioritise your work. Weekly planner is quite useful for me, as I need to keep track of important dates (project group meetup, exams, tutorials due date etc). The planner can also help organise your tasks that you need to accomplish so you can have a clear picture of what your day/week is going to be like. 

3.Choosing modules

Going to university after Junior College is quite overwhelming for me, primarily due to the change in learning environment. One of the questions I was having to refine my strategy on what modules to take and when to take it every semester. My tip is to read module reviews, to get a rough idea of the modules you intend to take. Note that the professors teaching the modules may vary every semester, so ask on top of asking your seniors.

Helpful links for module reviews

4.Explore 

Take the modules you like or interest you. Get out of your comfort zone. Popular modules that some took are language modules, computer science modules. You can save quite a lot of money by taking modules in schools. I have friends who picked up 3 languages. But of course, gauge your interest beforehand. Since Data Science has gained so much popularity, do your homework to see if it you are up for the challenge. Before I took the computer science modules, I went to look at the list of resources to get a sense of what will be covered in school. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0ve0p/uni_life_in_universitytips_nus_fass_modules/,True,2020-06-12 00:43:17
433,[O LEVELS] Common Mistakes / Bad Practices to Avoid for SS/HIST,"hihi! thank you for the crazy amount of messages and encouragement! so i thought i should share some of the common mistakes that students make for ss/history!

1. Not reading the Background Information (excuse: too many words) 

Honey, don't be lazy. The title and background information provided is to give you a gist on what the case study is about. Do NOT ignore it as it will provide you some context which may be useful in your analysis. Sometimes, the background information may provide key events/examples, issues, causes, effects related to the issue. So please spend 2-3 minutes reading the background information carefully and analyse it. 

FYI, background information isn't part of the source, so do NOT mix up background information as source evidence. They are DIFFERENT. However, if the background information helps to support your answer (usually because it is relevant to the source), then quote ""As stated in the background info...""

2. Immediately jumping into writing out the answers after taking a glance at the source & question.

This is a fatal mistake because your first impression of the source is usually superficial and/or misguided. Do not let this cloud your judgement and fix yourself to only one perspective/side of the source. Your aim is to craft out a sharp and in-depth analysis to demonstrate your critical thinking and understanding in your answers!

3. NOT answering the question directly.

If until now, you still can't ATQ properly, I suggest you keep reminding yourself. Write it BIG BIG at the top of every single page in ur question paper. Circle the keyword in the question stem.

E.g. What does Source A tell you...
Correct: Source A TELLS me...
Wrong: I can infer from Source A that...

Another common mistake: Are you surprised by Source F? 
Correct: I am surprised/not surprised by Source F... 
Wrong: Source F is reliable/unreliable...

The wrong answers encapsulate the same skill, but it just doesn't answer the question directly, due to the wrong question word used. To avoid this, simply copy the question stem at the start of your paragraph to avoid getting penalised. 

4. Incorrect answering structure

The thing is this: there is no fixed structure that you actually need to use. However, your answer should still encapsulate key elements.

For example, a comparison question would require a common criteria (what students usually forget), on top of inferences, evidence and explanation for both sources, with transition words in between.

FYI to remember ur transition words such as ""Similarly/Likewise"" to show similarities and ""However/On the other hand"" to show differences. If you missed out even one transition word, the whole comparison paragraph will not be considered. 

5. Poor/Vague/Invalid inferences

This problem occurs due to misinterpretation of source / inference not related to yardstick / overgeneralisations. 

To avoid this, highlight the yardstick from the question first. 

E.g. What does Source B tell you about the causes of Korean War? (The yardstick: CAUSES of Korean War) 

This means that your inference should be SPECIFICALLY made in relation to only the CAUSES (and not the effects/impacts). 

Do not include vague words such as positive/negative, good/bad in your inferences as well. 

Check that your inference can actually be deduced based on the evidence provided in the source. If it doesn't, or it isn't obvious, then it means that your inference is either invalid or weak. 

6. Not quoting evidence from source properly

Seems like a tiny mistake, but you may have accidentally forgotten to put inverted commas to show that you are quoting from the source (perhaps due to stress from time constraints). If this happens, your evidence wont be considered (i.e. no marks given for evidence/support). If you start to quote from the middle of the sentence, then do this: ""...family policies are effective."" (note the ellipsis used) 

Do not quote grandmother sentences as if you are about to quote the entire source as well. Please quote evidence SELECTIVELY (quote the part which is relevant/useful in helping u to ans the qn).

7. Paraphrasing evidence / Repeating inference as explanation 

Paraphrasing is NOT explanation. Paraphrasing means you are DESCRIBING. To explain effectively, ask yourself:

a) Explain HOW the piece of evidence supports your inference

b) Explain WHY you came to that inference/conclusion

c) LINK back to how ur entire argument answers the question

8. Not cross-referring properly (must know how to distinguish between cross-referenced source and base source!) 

Your first sentence should state: (example - how reliable is Source B?) 

Source B (base source) is *reliable/unreliable* because it is *supported/contradicted* by Source A (source that you are cross-referring to). 

Source A tells me that...(inference) (support) (explain) 

Therefore, Source B (base source) is reliable/unreliable. 

9. Missing out concluding statement for Reliability type of Questions 

At the end of every content paragraph, you will need to ATQ back (see example above). 

If you are doing highest-level analysis, you need to have a 3-step concluding statement. 

a) biased/not biased? (this step is not required for surprise qn)
b) reliable/unreliable, useful/not useful, expect/do not expect?
c) ATQ 

Failure to do so will result in the entire paragraph not being considered. 

10. Jumping into highest-level analysis

This is ok, but absolutely risky. Unless you are extremely confident that you have fully understood the source (including the provenance - date, author etc) + you have fully grasped the various sbq skills, then proceed.

Also warning that not ALL sources have a hidden agenda/purpose. Look out for the medium of the source. E.g. if it is just a passing remark by a random person, there wont be any hidden motive for u to analyse. thats why reading the provenance of the source is important - helps you to figure out the nature of the source. 

Rule of thumb is to start with content paragraphs as a safety net. Prioritise this over evaluation marks. 

11. Time Management issues

Spending too much time on SBQ - move on once u have exceeded the time limit. Esp the 10m question. Yes, it's hefty. But you cant afford to lose the 15m at the back too. Here's a suggested framework for the BARE minimum:

Basic Inference - 1 strong para (usually a good L3/4)

Message - ATQ + Message + Support + Evi (usually a good L3/4) 

Purpose - ATQ + Purpose + Audience + Message + Outcome + Support + Explain (usually a good L3/4)

Comparison - CC - Inference, Support, Explain for one source - Transition Word - Inference, Support, Explain for other source (2 solid paragraphs of this for L3/5)

Reliability/Utility/Surprise - 1 Basic Inference Paragraph + 1 Cross Reference Paragraph for L3/5

Hybrid (Comparison + Reliability) - Comparison Paragraph + Cross-Reference Paragraph for L3/5

Hybrid (Comparison + Surprise) - Comparison Paragraph for L3/4

Evaluation (Study all Sources) - write 1 vs 1 first to secure at least a pass for this qn

SRQ/SEQ (a) - 1 strong PEEL to get L3/6!
SRQ (b) - 1 strong PEEL to get L3/6!
HIST SEQ (b) - 2 strong PEELs to get L3/8-9! 

Again, this is just a guide. If you have mastered ur skills and you are confident of higher level analysis (aka if ur a perfectionist or rather kiasu like me), then feel free to skip the content paras and go ahead.

*For SS SRQ, extracts CANNOT be used as examples in your essays. 

That's all from me for now! All the best for your exams! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jgsakv/o_levels_common_mistakes_bad_practices_to_avoid/,True,2020-10-24 10:02:07
434,[Uni] Tips for application to UK universities,"Hello! It's application time for those applying to UK universities and I just wanted to share some tips for applying, writing your personal statements, and getting through the interview stage. Most of what I am saying may seem obvious, but many people tend to take it for granted. So, I compiled a list of what I thought helped me (and other students) most - hope it helps! 

&#x200B;

**Applying** 

1. You have 5 choices in the UCAS application portal. Ideally, do try to choose subjects of similar types so that your personal statement (PS) need not be divided to address the different courses that you are applying for. 
2. If your grades are slightly under the admission requirements for your desired course, don't be afraid to apply for it as your first choice. Admissions officers typically take into account your grades as well as your PS. So for example if you are applying for Law in UCL (for which the cutoff is AAB for A levels + your LNAT score), and you have ABB - take the chance and apply, and then support your application with a strong PS. Universities have admitted those who do not meet their cutoff points, provided that the applicant's PS is compelling. However, if your grades are too far off from the cutoff for your desired course, it would be better to apply to a course which cutoff is closer since the chances of getting in - even with a good PS - are not very high. Use your choices wisely.
3. Put at least your 4th and 5th choices as insurance choices i.e. schools which have lower admissions requirements that your grades definitely meet, just in case you are not offered a place in your top 3 choices. 
4. Do research into the university's culture before listing them as a choice - different universities have different cultures, and you may or may not like the academic and social environment that a university has to offer. If a university offers colleges (e.g. Cambridge and Oxford) for accommodation purposes - do further research into the different colleges. The environment that you study in has a huge impact on your mental well-being and your ability to study.

**Personal Statement**

1. For PSs, there are essentially 2 questions that you definitely have to answer in the course of your 4000 characters: why you, and why XXX course? If you read through your PS and find that you have not answered these questions at all, then your chances of successfully applying to any course for that matter will be very slim. 
2. Admissions officers want to see interest. They want to know what motivates you into applying and deciding to read a particular course, and any background story you have which reinforces your desire to read that course at university level. Be sure to engage them. Think of your PS as a storytelling exercise - you want the person reading it to be wowed and to be convinced that you are the person they are looking for in their university.
3. Use examples relevantly and sparingly. Do not bombard your PS with tons of examples of how you have done community work and the like if it isn't relevant to the course you have chosen. Examples should be used only to show that you have the character and ability to ace your chosen course, or to demonstrate your interest in the subject. I would advise against mentioning having read XXX book(s), which spurred your interest to further pursue this subject -  everyone reads books. This is a common trick used by many candidates if they do not have real-life examples to offer. Hence, only use such an example as a last resort. Otherwise, provide real and compelling examples from your daily experiences to support your PS.
4. Always have a proper structure for your PS in mind. Although it may be a storytelling exercise, each story must have a buildup and a conclusion. Plan what you want to say at the beginning, middle, and end of your essay. The last thing admissions officers want to read is 4000 characters with no logical structure to follow. That speaks volumes about your writing ability, as well as how well you present yourself to others.

**Interview stage (where applicable)**

1. You've finally been called for an interview - congratulations! This year's admissions interviews will likely take place online via Skype or Zoom - make the necessary preparations to be interview-ready whilst facing a laptop or computer. However, for both in-person and online interviews, one key piece of advice is NOT to use verbal fillers. Singaporeans are especially guilty of this. If you need time to think, simply let the interviewer know that you need time, and then stay silent. Do not start off your sentences with ""Um..."" or ""Ah...""etc. This takes practice, so practice it with a friend or your family members.
2. Interviewers assess you not based on how many answers you get correct (unless you're applying for a mathematics-based course, then this doesn't apply to you), but rather your reasoning process. They want to know how you reason through your thinking and how you arrive at your conclusion. Interviewers, typically look out for candidates who demonstrate clear thinking abilities. This is coupled with the demands of your course: for example, if you're applying to Medicine, they would want to know how you deal with patients, with emergencies, and how you applying biological or chemistry concepts towards something which you have never come across before. If you're applying for Law, they would want to see how you defend your point of view and how you respond to certain twists in factual scenarios. 
3. If you genuinely do not know how to answer a question, be honest with the interviewer and state that you are unsure of how to approach the problem. However, do not stop there - offer your own explanation of how you have tried to solve or approach it, and then let them know which part has stumped you. This demonstrates maturity in that you recognise that you are not all-knowing, and are willing to defer to authority for assistance. 
4. Do not try to over-impress your interviewer. They can tell when you're trying to show off. Instead, be friendly and respectful and engage in small talk (if they do so first) so that they can take a (small) liking to you. Every win counts!

435,[UNI] How I got into Yale-NUS (Just some personal advice and tips) AMA if you want.,"LONG POST AHEAD

Hi all,Using a throwaway because I'll be divulging some personal details here. I realise that Yale-NUS has a very opaque and confusing admissions system and its virtually impossible to figure out ""how"" to get in when you don't have information like IGPs. I have plenty of friends who scored more than 5 RP higher or had illustrious ECs that were rejected. I don't claim to be an expert on getting in, but I can tell you what are some things that I did differently that may have helped me get an offer. Considering that there are very few resources out there, I figured this could be somewhat useful.

**Also, given that the results came out recently, if you didn't get in, don't be disheartened. There are many factors and luck is one of them.** I read about an international student rejected from Yale-NUS but accepted to Harvard, and if you're telling me that Yale-NUS is better than Harvard then you've got another thing coming. (I'm intending to matriculate in Yale-NUS and I'm madly in love with the school btw HAHA). Case in point, the system can be arbitrary and unfair, and whether you get in or not has no bearing on your value as a person.

First off, Yale-NUS practices holistic admissions. What that means is that there isn't a ""minimum grade"" per se. For example, if you were to compare it to NUS Medicine, if you don't meet a certain RP/GPA/IB score, you will be filtered out. That doesn't really seem to be the case at Yale-NUS. I've heard of GPAs ranging from 3.0 and above and RPs around the high 70s that gained admission. That's not to say that its easy to get in, if you're on the lower end of the spectrum, you need to ""score"" higher in terms of your CCAs , essays, quick takes and ""telling your story"". I'll give more detailed advice on these areas later. Essentially, the various components of an application are all considered together in making an admission decision.

&#x200B;

Also, Yale-NUS wants diversity. Among the 60% of places that have been reserved for Singaporeans, they want people from JC, from Poly, from international schools as well as other less conventional pathways. Besides academics, they want a variety in terms of the ""types"" of people. It's a liberal arts (and sciences) school, but they don't just want poets and writers. They want a fair share of aspiring doctors, inventors, athletes, artists and whatever else you can think of. What does that mean? It means that they can only take in so many ""elite"" JC people, or hardcore MUN kids, or whatever the stereotypical profile of a liberal arts student is. So don't let your supposedly ""disadvantaged background"" hold you back. Because believe it or not, you probably DO have an interesting story to tell.

Here are my stats. If you want more details, PM me.

Top JC (Trust me, Yale-NUS isn't full of people from Top JCs. Even JCs that people tend to see as average or below average are represented)

History, Econs, ELL and h1 math, 83.75 UAP, ABB/B +A for GP and PW (Below the average for my school. For those of you who thought you need 87 UAP to get in, I'm proof that you don't. )

Scored BCD/B+ B for GP at prelims, nothing too bad but not amazing either.

Sports CCA ExCo (for quite a niche non-team sport, was only slightly above average in terms of competitive results, far from national team level)

Vice-chair for service learning project for 1 year. Small-scale project conducted in collaboration with a few resident's committees)

Participated in a few MUN conferences (Never won anything, pretty average and lowkey)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Grades:** It goes without saying, score as well as you can. Why handicap yourself right? Don't let your eventual score deter you from applying though

**CCAs:** You don't need a lot of them. Really. I did my service learning project in Sec 4 and focused on my sport throughout JC. You do however, need to be COMMITTED to them. What Yale-NUS looks for (as do most US universities) is a ""spike"", meaning something that you're extraordinarily good at, extraordinarily committed to, or has had an extraordinary impact on your personal development. In my case, that was my sport. I was okay (I hope?) at it, but I dedicated lots of hours to it to make up for neglecting it for 4 years in secondary school (wow my friends might recognise me already) and I also made sure to talk a lot about how the sport **influenced my personal development and built my character.** This is probably more important than listing achievements and awards. You need to show how this activity made you, you!

**EDIT: From** u/Exoriaaa

In relation to “they’re looking for a spike”, I quite literally shared in my essay that “I liked to do many things but I’m not amazing at any”. It’s largely a piece on how I struggled to build my identity on what I do, only to realise that “hey, why do I have to be good at something to identify with it?” I don’t think you have to be particularly amazing at one thing.

Be reflective/introspective, be quirky, be yourself. In quick takes I quite literally answered “Why did the chicken cross the road?” for one of the question skfjiejsofjsodjj. Have fun doing the application! I feel like it’s really meant for you to highlight your personality :D

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Essays, Quick Takes and ""Why Yale-NUS"" section:** This is where your story comes together, and it's very important how exactly you tell it. From the Yale-NUS website, things they are looking for are: Adventurousness, willingness to learn/try new things, empathy, willingness to see/hear new perspectives and caring about the wider society  (hope I didn't miss anything but this is basically what I made sure to include). **Your personality, character and the emotional maturity you demonstrate by being able to articulate these things** are much more important than how many points there are on your CV. Bonus points if you refer to specific things about Yale-NUS, such as articles in the student newspaper The Octant, events on campus or student organisations that show that you've done research and you are certain you're a good fit.

A common mistake is to list your achievements as reasons why you should be admitted. That probably comes off more as cocky than anything. You should use your achievements as evidence to substantiate wider points you made about yourself. The focus isn't on what awards you won or projects you completed. The focus is on how the journey towards these accomplishments helped you grow as a person.

Specifically for the essays, I was inspired by some of these essays: [https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/college-essay-examples](https://www.collegeessayguy.com/blog/college-essay-examples). If you want to know more about what I wrote, PM me because I'd rather not make my essays too public.

&#x200B;

**Interview:** If you got the interview, congratulations! From here on though, a lot of people still get rejected. The important things to do are to prepare your story- Who are you? Do you identify as an writer, a singer, a sportsman? Who do you want to be? What do you want to do? (I told my interviewer I just wanted to better understand people and enter a field where I could use this to create value. I admitted I wasn't sure where I would fit in, but I had some direction at least). I identified as a nerd-jock who loves finding out how the world works just as much as he loves competitive sports. I also made sure to keep things really casual (still try not to use TOO much Singlish, even though Singlish is a big part of who I am HAHA), and I even mentioned a Netflix series that I ~~binged 2 weeks before my Block Test 2~~ watched.  Just be honest about who you are (of course don't mention red flags or step into political/religious areas, have some common sense).

Also, if you know specific things about the school that you couldn't fit into your essays/weren't appropriate for essays, then mention them as well!

Bonus tip: Your interviewer is probably going to be a student! So be chill and ask lots of questions about their life and their goals as well. Don't be afraid to joke around with them. If you can show that you're REALLY interested in their life at Yale-NUS and the wider community, you can definitely improve your chances.  The dress code said dress casual and I did (although my dad wouldn't stop ranting about how I made a bad choice but I stand by it). I opted to do so because it wasn't a law or business interview, it was more of an informal conversation for the interviewer to figure out if you're a good fit for the community.

Once again, I repeat: **Your story** is the most important thing here. Show that you understand who you are, and that this person is a good fit for the university. Stay true to who you are and don't pretend to be someone you aren't.

&#x200B;

EXTRA TIP: 60% of the slots are reserved for Singaporeans. In round 1, many Singaporean students don't apply because they think their prelim grades aren't good enough or because they're lazy and think that it's fine to apply when they get their A level grades. To improve your chances, apply in round 1 where less Singaporeans have applied. It's well known that in many of the top US universities, round 1 admissions have a higher acceptance rate, and I suspect that the same is true for Yale-NUS.

I don't think I've covered everything but that's all I can think of right now so AMA below! I hope that this can be a useful resource for anyone who wants some information.

Some background, I'm a girl in uni year 1, I got to know this guy (j2 taking As now) through a friend. We texted quite abit initially at the earlier part of this year cos he wasnt as busy and he hinted at the the idea of us being together. However, after that the convo died down, i thought maybe he wasn't interested anymore. However from time to time , he will ask me for notes etc. Well I thought maybe he just needed help. But recently he asked if me out for lunch after his alevels. I rejected saying I have final exams. But I'm just internally confused?!? Recently he sent me a screenshot of an article saying how Singaporean women are more accepting of younger guys... Frankly, i quite like him, we are on the same frequency etc, oh and he's damn hot haha. Idk if he's interested in me or just as a friend?!? 



Personally I don't think age matters, but I'm a little afraid of the stigma plus idk if jc guys would date older girls haha. 


Tdlr Jc guys, would y'all date girls slightly older than u? Or are there any girls out there with any experience dating younger guys?

For me, it was not studying hard enough so that I could get access to better opportunities. When I was younger, I didn't really see the need to get good grades, so I didn't develop any proper study habits. After secondary school, I started to regret not working hard enough as I saw all my high-flying peers get access to the best student and extracurricular opportunities out there, while I slumped behind.

440,[O levels] 220 in PSLE to 7 nett L1R5,"This is not a success story or a way for me to brag about my results and what not. Instead I just want to share/inspire with those taking their Os in years to come that no matter where you are at now(academically,mentally etc), you can still aim for the stars.

After receiving my psle result, I was extremely disheartened. I could not enter any of the school I initially wanted. I felt like a failure. I felt like I disappointed my parents. My mother placed me in a neighbourhood school ,that I had no interest in, as it was affiliated to a JC, in case I mess up my Os like how I messed up my psle. 

(Won’t share much about lower sec as it was really mundane and nothing really important) 

Sec3 started and the work load was intense.I managed to enter the triple sci class, taking amths and ss/geog. Also I’m an Indian who takes Chinese as my mother tongue. Have some Chinese blood in my veins but no one in my family can speak Chinese. By mid year I had an L1R5 of 19. I couldn’t understand and didn’t do well in amths, physics, chem, geog,bio.  The only subjects I was good at were SS and Chinese( my sch gave the answers to exams in hopes that more people will pass their Chinese ). I then decided it was for the greater good if I dropped a subject. I genuinely enjoyed studying bio. Amths is necessary for H2 maths. No one can drop chem or geog. So I dropped physics. Was a tough decision, as I was the only one in my class to do so(at that time）and people mocked me. But I also never understood what the teacher was teaching and though I scored a B3 for it in mid years it was really cause I had done the P1 before and I merely regurgitated the answers.

I then proceeded to find myself a tutor. After countless trials and errors, I finally found the right one. He teaches all three sciences and double maths. If u want his contact ( only does tuition at his home in Sembawang now ) just message me directly. IM NOT PROMOTING YEAH I JUST WANNA SHARE. He was really patient and helpful. He really made an impact nearing Os. But my EOYs I was still struggling with most of my subjects like Bio, Maths, Amths( worst subject haha ) and geog. English was a constant B4 and Chinese... well lets not talk about it yet as I said, we were all kinda cheating. 

Over the December  holidays I decided that I’m going to start working harder. also note during sec 3 I was really emotionally unstable. I was facing so much pressure from CCA, toxic friendships and even more toxic ppl who just wanted to make me hate myself. I put an end to several friendships and started distancing myself from friends who really didn’t see the importance of Os as much as I did. Amths was really painful haha. I spent so many hours just trying to solve questions. Trust me, if I can do it, so can you. I know it ain’t easy. BUT DONT REFER TO THE SOLUTION WITHOUT TRYING. It’s hard. But I had to persevere and wreck my brain to find the solutions. It may take hours. But once you manage to solve the question, the sense of satisfaction is the only reward you’ll need. And you’ll never need to refer the solutions again. 
Once all the leadership stuff and CCA ended, I had more time to invest in my studies. Every morning I would wake up extra early to do extra work on my weaker concepts and chapters. I started doing my homework on my own and not by copying others. Fortunately others in my class were doing the same thing as I was, and though we never really chatted before, we started studying together and soon a clique was formed. 

MT Os were held in June unlike other subjects. So my school stopped other lessons and we had MT intensive from 8 to 5 for 2 weeks.  This is when you go all out man. My brain hurt from all the Chinese I was immersing myself into. Mind you it really wasn’t easy for someone like me. But I pressed on. All the Chinese phrases I memorise. All the TYS papers I did( I completed the entire TYS so that’s 20 Olvl papers to prep u for ). I constantly seek my Chinese teacher for consults ( even when he was sick lol ). And every weekend when my tutor came to my place I would give her work to do haha. I would do Paper 1s and 2s for her to mark on top of my school work. Don’t waste time on games anymore, or social events and what not. If u need a break, legit just go for a walk,it really helps. Oral was even more hard for me as Ive mentioned a million times by now, I’m not Chinese. But seek consults guys, your Teachers are willing to help. If not, ask the other Chinese Teachers if you feel that yours isn’t available or useful. It all paid off as I got A2 for Chinese and didn’t choose to resit. 

So until November, don’t waste time. See the respective Teachers for help, use every pocket of time you get to revise concepts, or do questions. It will be tiring and you will feel like giving up, but just remember, it will all be over soon. The day you get that darn Olevel cert will be the greatest reward of all time. Find yourself a group of friends who have the same goals as you, and it doesn’t have to be the same destination. 
So a few weeks ago I got back my results. 7 distinctions, 3 A1s ( Amths, Maths and Bio) and 4A2s ( EL, Chi, CH and Chem) . I wont lie at first I was slightly disappointed. Wanted A1s for Chem and CH. I messed up chem practical and I am extremely bad at physical geog.  But then I realised that not many can get such a score and it was the fruit of my labour, so I should be contended. My tutor had a huge help in my double sciences and double maths. My school Chinese teacher and my tutor for my Chinese. A teacher who didn’t even teach my class helped me out with my English. An amazing ss teacher, a funny and interesting chem teacher, 2 terrific maths Teachers and 2 special geog Teachers. Don’t forget to thank those who have helped you on your education pathway. If not for them, I wouldn’t have done so well. Now I’m just praying everyday that I can enter my dream school though it is a bit risky [COP also 7 points]. 

This isn’t a success story, but a story of sheer hard work, grit, facing your setbacks, and just doing your utmost best. I sincerely hope this will help others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/es9v70/o_levels_220_in_psle_to_7_nett_l1r5/,True,2020-01-23 01:58:39

445,[o levels] stressed not because of Os,"Hi guys :) 2020 has been a shit year. So my brother got diagnosed with cancer and during my o level week he is going to a treatment which he has a 50% chance of surviving so I’m extremely extremely worried for him. On top of that my eyesight is getting worse. I’ve been seeing ghost vision since Sec 2 (instead of seeing 1 object I see multiple) and upon further research I found out I potentially might have keratoconous which can potentially lead to blindness. I’m so worried. Because what is the point of studying my as of os this few months that I’m going to go blind eventually ???? On top of that I have high myopia of 500 degrees (potentially 600 now due to heavy studying) I just cannot. In fact during my study break it has not been productive because I will spend hours and hours on end trying to find a solution to reverse my myopia instead of studying, I spend the whole day praying to Jesus (I’m Catholic) for mercy on my eyes and every time I look at things and see the double images I get a panic Attack inside. Do note this has happening to me since Sec 2 but I didn’t really think about it until the study break because I was Too busy before. I’m def gonna see a eye doctor after o levels to check what’s up with my eyes and the only thing I can do is laser surgery if I confirm have that condition and I’m scared shitless now. I’m completely neglecting my studies rn. I didn’t study today and I have hard time concerating during tution because anxiety ya know. It just sucks you know my life just came crashing onto me. And it’s no better in school my form Teachers accuse me of shit I didn’t do in front of my principal. I just cannot. I’m just worried for what will happen during Os and although I did sufficiently prepare I’m scared my mental health and eyesight  will just crash and I will lose my brother.

other subjects i'm really scared for is my physics and both maths as well as my ss. i've pretty much memorized the entire physics topical tys so far because of how many practices i did but i still see no improvement. i understand most of the topics but i just can't get the questions right. everytime i look at a math equation, i just lose all motivation and just want to go to sleep and never wake up. no matter what i do, i just keep on making careless mistakes and will never get the questions correct. just today, my friends were talking about how they got really high for this e math quiz on trigo, and i couldn't even discuss it with them because i got 5/14 and i just felt like shit. for ss, i just do not have the capability to answer the questions. i do not possess the skills required to answer the questions, and i don't think i ever will. i've been wanting to consult my teachers, but recently the tutorial schedule just came out and i pretty much have no time for that even if my teachers have the time to meet me.

on top of that, my 2 strongest subjects, chem & bio, have been getting worse partly because i've been focusing on physics & a math a lot, but at the same time, i don't have enough time to study for those subjects. since we technically did not step down, my school is still asking the student leaders to do some shit that i don't even want to do and did not sign up for in the first place. 

anyway, even if i manage to get my academics in order, i don't even know what i want to do in the future even though i'm planning to dsa. after jc, i really don't know what i want in life at all. i feel like i would have a very hard & stressful time if i continue to do sciences but at the same time i can't do any type or arts except performing arts & i'm not even good at it either.

i also kind of want hbl to continue since for most of the subjects, we finished the syllabus already and it would just be better for me mentally if i could just stay at home & revise at my own time. i don't want to do anything anymore but at the same time i know there will be consequences for not doing anything and idk what to do anymore. i have no motivation to do anything",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gwfhv6/rant_i_dont_want_to_do_anything_anymore/,True,2020-06-05 03:16:53

449,[Rant] I'm in a weird headspace,"i don't know how to start this post even. i'm taking o levels in a week's time, and i haven't touched a single book since prelims. i keep seeing posts on here saying ""just get started"" and ""something is better than nothing"". though i understand the intent behind these words, i just can't find the heart to do it. i'm an ""all or nothing"" kind of guy, but i can't seem to even put my all. maybe it's a personal issue, that i just never was and might never will be the kind to mug tons of hours away, to the point that it just never became a habit. i'm not sure how i got to this point doing so little, but after thinking about it over time, i now realise how utterly screwed i could be for o levels. i think it was because i knew full well that prelim papers were gonna be harder, and when i got back my subpar results (which, due in part met my expectations) of L1R4 22, i went ""if my prelim liddat, then o level confirm better right?"" and i haven't been able to shake this mentality. i'll be honest; i wasted this past week of study break. i did nothing all day but fake study (put my book in front of me but never touch it), play games and watch shows till late into the night. i know the weightage and importance of o levels and how it's a pivotal point in my education journey, but right now my attitude's been like i've already taken the exam. i don't feel any stress about it at all, and i'm not the slightest bit worried about the exams. this is what made me not able to pick up a book and just start. if anyone has advice or can offer last minute assistance, i appreciate it greatly. 

i require heavy assistance in science and social studies. i'm basically at a sec 2 level of science knowledge, and as for social studies, i just can't seem to be accurate in answers and that dumb time limit screws me over a ton. i don't expect to pass science (E8 for prelim), and i'm ready to take my MT in place of it (C6, which isn't the greatest but i've got EAE so i'm not too worried). my priority now is to just get the exams over with, and an L1R4 of 15 is my target. many will gawk at my low expectations/goals, but this is what i can manage with what time i have left.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j8yh9b/rant_im_in_a_weird_headspace/,True,2020-10-11 19:51:15

451,[RANT] Feeling lonely and i have no friends,"Ever since sec school I always was lonely I had no proper friends to talk to or to hang out I just don't know why even if I made some friends they always leave me and go away to other ppl like I nvr existed. Some just come into my life just to satisfy their needs and use me and aft their needs has been fulfilled, they just throw me aside like a used tissue paper. I don't know what's my problem? Why can't I make friends. I'm a private Candidate taking my o levels this year and I'm also taking higher nitec in early childhood in one of the ite. To make this worst, the entire class is made up of mostly girls and only thers oni 4 guys incl myself. I tried to talk to some ppl and make friends but it didn't help. Most of them had their own cliques already since I am a guy I dk how I am going to make friends in class full of girls. There's 3 other guys in my class but i can tell that they are not interested in making friends with me cos whenever I go to them all they do is to talk in chi (not trying to be racist) but it's rely got into my head. Like if 1 person talk in chi the others would reply in chi like even when I am there I feel so left out. I am with 3 girls now mainly because of group projects but I don't think they are thinking of me as a friend maybe just classmates. With my o levels coming up, I can't think of what to do. I feel so lonely and left out. Is this wat happens if you join into a girls course. This thought scares me as I would be going to poly and would be pursuing early childhood and honestly I am scared what if the entire class is girls (one of my friend told me that this year np ecde one of the class is fully girls) I don't want fate to repeat itself in poly like how it happened in sec school and ite. Even the people that I talk to normally aren't talking to me and moving their distance away from me. Why does tis always happen to me?? I just don't know what to do at this point of time.

452,[Rant] I never had any authority over my 12 choices for JAE.,"
  So yes, I got a L1R5 of 8 for olvls and I really want to sign up for the Cyber Security and Digital Forensics Diploma course at Ngee Ann Poly but my parents are very against this idea and did everything they could to change my mind so I would go to a JC. However I still held on to my initial choice without yielding and this was all it came to. My parents took away my JAE PIN when I wasn’t looking and decided they would input the 12 options on their own. I worked very hard just to get this opportunity to get into the course I really like and want to invest in.

  Is it right for them to take authority of my life choices? Am I just an ignorant child that doesn’t know much about the real world? If it is wrong of them to strip my freedom of choice then is there anybody I can find that will help me out with this ordeal?

453,[Jobs] CV Review for Students (5-day update!),"Hi all! 

Just 5 days ago, I posted on this subreddit offering a Free CV Review for students.

Thank you so much to all who have trusted in me to review their CVs! I hope you found my feedback helpful in launching your jobseeking journey. Thank you for leaving very kind reviews too. 

Thanks to COVID, today’s job market is rough. Like, real rough. Fresh graduates and even experienced professionals are struggling to secure jobs. It’s even more challenging to find internships. But don’t get us wrong - companies are still hiring. It’s therefore really important to position your professional experiences well, with an impactful CV to stand a chance in gaining employment amidst this climate. 

(If you want to send in your CV for Review, just DM me.)

Some of you asked me questions which I thought might be helpful for others in this subreddit. Here are 3 frequently asked questions.

&#x200B;

# 1. What is a CV?

A CV (also known as a resume in Singapore’s context) is a professional document that jobseekers like you and me use when applying for jobs. It captures our previous and current work experiences, professional Achievements, educational background, and other relevant information for employers. Employers read your resume to gauge how suitable you are for the role they’re hiring for. If they think you’re eligible or skilled, then you get moved to the next stage of the hiring pipeline, which is a job interview.

&#x200B;

# 2. How do I transfer across industries as a student or young professional?

Young people like us are still trying to find our way in our careers and lives. Employers understand this. In fact, the best time to transition across industries and different job roles would be as a student or young professional. It gets more difficult as you climb the ladder in your industry. 

So, how do you transfer across industries as a student/young professional? There are 2 ways to go about doing this:

**1.** **Highlight transferable skills from previous roles you worked in.**

For example, you want to transfer from a Marketing job to a Business Analytics job. Some transferable skills across both roles might be fluency with Data Analytics software (like Google Analytics, Microsoft Power BI, Tableau etc.) and collection/collation of data to draw insights/make business decisions. If you have experiences with these skills or experiences, play these experiences up in your resume.

&#x200B;

**2. Enter your desired sector based on roles you already have experience in, then branch out from within.**

Let’s use the same example as above. Instead of switching from Marketing to Business Analytics by applying for a new job, you can apply for a Marketing role in a Data Analytics/Business Analytics company. This way, you have a higher chance of securing a role in the new company. Then, branch out within this new company into your desired domain. Ask to be more involved in Data Analytics projects, or help your Business Analytics colleagues to solve problems at work etc. This way, not only can you switch across domains, but you can also gauge whether you actually enjoy this new workscope while having your old domain as a safety net to fall back on.

&#x200B;

# 3. Would MOOCs such as courses from Coursera and Udemy be recognized by HR as proof of knowledge/skills?

Absolutely! There is merit in taking online courses as they demonstrate initiative and proactiveness. If you do take these courses, do include them in your CV under a separate ‘Courses’ or ‘Certifications’ section! Of course, what would be even more valuable is if you manage to demonstrate HOW you’ve applied skills you’ve learnt from these courses, in personal projects or by solving real business problems.

&#x200B;

**1 bonus question:**

# What is your background? Do you work in HR? Why are you doing this?

I’ve been working in HR for a year now. I work on both client and employer sides of HR, so I’m super grateful for the opportunity to experience both sides of the table. I work as a professional resume writer and in HR for a local company (can’t divulge company names for confidentiality purposes). I’m doing this because I genuinely enjoy listening to and helping clients’ career journeys, and assisting candidates to further their careers. Unfortunately most candidates do not manage to secure their dream jobs due to their CV. Of course, sometimes they may drop off at the interview stage, but that’s another story for another day :)

&#x200B;

This post turned out longer than expected lol. But I hope you’ve found this useful! 

Feel free to send in your CVs for me to review if you’d like. Just drop me a DM. I’d be happy to help in any way I can :)

All the best with your jobseeking journey!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/khvark/jobs_cv_review_for_students_5day_update/,True,2020-12-22 17:40:52
454,[Uni] The truth about NTU-REP,"**I've decided to post the contents of** [**this deleted thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hiogbx/uni_the_truth_about_nturep/) **so that potential REP students may make an informed choice. I'm not the author of the original post. Do read the comments to get a balanced view.** 

I would like to bring to light certain facts about NTU's Renaissance Engineering Program. While none of these facts are controversial, I believe it is important that someone who has experienced student life in this program voice out various concerns.

The purpose of this post is two-fold:

Firstly, to give pre-university students who are considering the program an alternate view so that they can make a better uni decision. I believe that this might be a little late for students matriculating this August, as you might have already accepted your uni offers. Apologies if you gain some revelation from this post and find out its too late.

Secondly, to be the alternate voice to the manufactured marketing materials put out by the program's office.

I would like to start off by saying I will be as impartial as possible, and try to present things in a neutral light where possible.

Budget Cuts

To address the elephant in the room: Yes, our program is experiencing budget cuts. Obviously being a student, I would have no access to the management's balance sheets but the changes observed at the receiving end are quite obvious.

Incoming students have mentioned on several forums about how they aren't offered a scholarship for this program and are questioning if the program is worth the expensive school fees.

\>To these students stuck in the dilemma: don't feel bad about not receiving a scholarship. This is more a result of budget cuts rather than your own performance in the interviews. I believe that you are still extremely capable.

While I acknowledge that I have seen quite a handful of pre-university students who are caught in the dilemma of being offered a place in REP but without a scholarship, I shall not pass an opinion on whether the program is worth it without a scholarship. That's for you to decide.

Student activities are quite significantly affected as well. REP has several student led, engineering based CCAs. All these clubs have experienced the effect of budget cuts. While I am not in these CCAs, I have heard info about how the Overseas CIP club hasn't been able to make an overseas trip to continue its projects and the Makers Lab has halt funding for self initiated engineering projects. While I agree that it is essential for us to be prudent about financial resources, I will take the stand that cutting these student activities has shown that the program's management has disregarded student life, which is in direct contradiction to their branding about ""REP's rich engineering based student activities"".

Administration

Throughout a student's time in REP, most of the academic and student life matters are handled by REP office. To summarize my experience with the staff, communicating my requests to them is frustrating most of the time. I feel that they have a rigid stance on how the program should be run and aren't able to comprehend when students request for something different from what they planned. (More on that later when I discuss academia).

I believe this rigidity has been made apparent by COVID. It is common knowledge that the REP program offers a year abroad in a partner university during a normal year. The exchange for the current batch of year 3s have been cancelled, understandably.

As an alternative, students from that batch approached the program's head with suggestions such as online courses with the exchange universities or delaying the exchange to year 4. These students went to the extent of crafting a document which included their own feasibility analysis of each suggestion to demonstrate their involvement in coming up with a solution. The program head merely stated that these suggestions were dismissed and he was not open to further suggestions.

(At this juncture I would like to point out that none of the program's staff have actually addressed us since the pandemic started. It would at least be nice to receive one of those ""Stay strong together during covid"" emails from the school. Guess not.)

Professionalism

Several incidents have made me believe that the REP management lack professionalism.

In a personal incident, a friend of mind was consulting with one of the program's directors regarding pursuing a certain academic option.

\>The director replied: ""Sure \[OP's friend\], please go ahead with this academic option. However, I do not think \[OP\] should take this option as his results aren't very good.""

This comment came out of nowhere as this friend had never mentioned me in the conversation leading up to that comment. I would at least expect that staff to treat each student's matters separately. (For those that are curious, I held a first class honours gpa for every semester in uni. Perhaps I need a zeroth class honours to get into the good books of this staff.)

In another incident passed down the grapevine, a student received an undesired grade for a particular course. He asked for a review of the assessment scheme on the basis that all the CA scores he received were higher than the end grade. The reply from REP office was quite shocking.

\>Dear \[student from REP\],

\>

\>Noted your request to review \[ABC course\]. However I noticed you got a lower grade for \[completely unrelated XYZ course\]. Are you saying that your grade for \[ABC course\] isn't good enough?

Another piece of information passed down the grapevine. The batch of students who were on exchange when COVID began were recalled a few months short of completing their exchange year. REP management then required that the few months worth of overseas allowance be returned to the school. I won't pass an opinion on this but perhaps there is a better way to handle this disruption to students' education?

Opportunities

On the topic of exchange university choices, REP students get to choose their preferred exchange university.\*

\*Provided that the choices are evenly spread between the university. Otherwise, the program's management will resort to painting a bleak picture of life in the most popular university in an effort to convince students to pick another one. If all else fails, the management just conducts a ballot.

I'll just leave this here. Don't choose REP if you are gunning for a specific exchange university. Try your best to apply directly to whichever overseas university you are aiming for. There are batches of REP students that have indeed gone through a ballot.

Academia

Finally, if you have read until this point and believe that academics are all that matter, I would like to point out that NTU's ""excellent"" world rankings are boosted by its research activity, not its instruction. While I agree that REP fellows are indeed some of the best professors, most of our technical instruction will come from the common engineering courses from the various engineering schools.

I personally feel that some of the courses are tough because the instructor's content are obfuscated. Students struggle not because they can't think critically, but because they are ill equipped to solve problems. (My personal benchmark for a ""good and tough"" course would be one where a student is given sufficient, clear info regarding the topic and still has to make the mental leap to apply this info for complex problems.)

Back to my point about REP management's rigidity. REP specifies a fixed number of each units a student has to take during each semester. A handful of students chose to take additional courses as electives out of interest. As a result, they did not strictly follow the curriculum. The program head made an offhand comment that ""it was a mistake letting REP students take extra electives"". I have to put my foot down here and say that this statement is a direct contradiction to what it means to learn as a student.

Conclusion

I hope that prospective students gain a better idea through my (somewhat salty) account of experiences in REP. I do not intend to antagonize anyone through this post.

this is a weird thing to ask but I would really like to know what are some things y'all talk about so maybe I can learn more about them so I wont be so boring.

456,[RANT] Really feel like gonna fail h2 history,"Hi all, writing this cos i really cannot take the stress of h2 history anymore

After O levels, i thought that would be the last time i would open a history textbook but because of my o level results i had to go into arts stream and take h2 hist because my parents really wanted me to go to a certain ""x"" jc. At first, i was really adamant about not doing it as i really didnt like history in sec 3 and 4. Not that i like detested it (was actually fun to learn then) but i felt if i carried it on to As, the content and exam format will kill me. So i decided to try for ""x"" jc science stream but yep, nope. I thought of proposing to go to ""y"" jc but seeing how much my parents wanted me to go to ""x"" jc plus all my friends being there and how ppl said the history department was good, I yielded.

That proved to be one of the worst decisions of my life, just dragging on the subject for the sake of it.

In the first few months it was still ok which on hindsight was not beneficial for me as it gave me the illusion that i can do it and thus not appeal out. After that, i started to lag all the way and for j1, i got an E for history overall. Some ppl will say ""can what u pass"" but this E was a fake one. The only reason it was a pass was because of moderation and CAs, with my terms and promos getting both low S (i got a shock when i saw E also).

Then in j2, it all collapsed. At the start of the year, I decided to focus more on my h2 econs + math (as my econs was strong and ppl said math was easier to get B/A). So history from then on was a burden where i studied it just to be able to answer questions in class. Some context on how bad it all is, I have never passed math in my entire jc life (low U like 15%, never out of 0-20 percentile) and i have more confidence of getting a B for the math papers i have already taken than even passing history which i have actl passed before in jc. Now, all the content is just staring back at me and I really feel super destroyed. I just keep on thinking, what if i had gone to ""y"" jc and took h2 chem instead? Yes, ik ppl say h2 chem very hard but still, idt it would have been worse.

Now, I'm just working my ass off for history but tbvh, i just wanna grind econs to do well for that and history can just go to hell. Can anyone give me any advice?? Like ik i must study now and i will do that, but now im just begging and asking for any possible alternatives to solve this regretful decision i made which may impact my uni life and my future

457,[Rant] I feel like I need advice on how to overcome this...,"I hope those who read this won't tl;dr cos i rly need help.

For some context im a 20yo guy in NS, going to NUS BIZ next year. Its been a rly painful year due to both COVID and my NS schedule. 

I have a friend (20F) that ive known and was close to since Sec 3 who's currently in y2 of NUS biz as well. Naturally, we drifted ever since she went to Uni. We had a big fight way back in June bc I rushed her into meeting to catch up when phase 2 started. She was busy with her internship and cca committments and rly didnt have time to catch up with me. So bc of that, she stopped replying my texts and basically removed me from her life, blocking me from her spam n stuff.

I spammed her and kept apologising desperately but despite that she still remained cold and unresponsive at times.

I was at fault for rushing things and making her feel awkward and stressed with trying to please me. As of now, things just arent the same anymore, even though she claims that shes not angry at me and that she stills sees me as a friend.

I dont know how stressful it is, i see many ppl in the same course enjoying life more than others. And not being in Uni yet means I can't rly relate well to her life and her mental state as well. She has btr friends in Uni, and tbh i feel that my time as her friend is over, but I still hope we can reconcile.

The easiest advice that ppl have given me is to forget abt her and move on, after all shes not my gf. But she was and still is an important person to me and it rly sucks to give up bc of one fight. What can I do in this situation? Can someone enlighten me on your experiences in Biz too? It'll help me alot.

458,[UNI] How does one do well in Uni?,"So basically I’ve always been a average/slightly above average kind of student. In Secondary I was above average but only because most people didn’t really put in effort and when I went to a mid-tier JC I was average. 

I managed to score ok for As and got into NUS FASS but I would like to change my narrative from Uni onwards to really be way above average and to do really well. I have always accepted that I was just a mid-tier student but I don’t wanna be that anymore. 

So it begs the question of how exactly does one do well for Uni? I’m planning to major in Pol Sci in FASS and minor in a language. I understand there isn’t a magic method that works for all but I’d appreciate any input like basic study tips, attitude tips, pro tips etc!

It feels like once you fall down, its almost impossible to pull yourself back up to the top. I even studied more than I ever had before, yet I kept on disappointing myself.

I will be honest here; I often envy my old self. I was able to do so many stupid and risky things but managed to still pull them off. Even up till sec 1 some semblance of that reckless smartass was there. (In sec 1, my last act of craziness was changing a school rule) But I feel like my life experiences have left me beaten and battered to the point where I can no longer stand up for myself. I really wish I was that person I used to be.

I don't really know if I will really be able to pursue medicine like I want to, and if I will even be able to get into JC at this rate. Best part of it all? My dumb arse still thinks it can somehow make it into harvard if I try hard enough. 

Its like I am doing a lot of catching up now, and I srsly just wanna quit my path for medicine and take business or smth sometimes, but I feel that I would lose my life's purpose if I do so. So I am just dragging my arse forward, hoping that my efforts will somehow pay off someday, and I do become the person I want to be.

Sry if the above rant is very unorganised; there was a lotta things to get off my chest.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k3adfx/rant_my_life_is_a_mess/,True,2020-11-30 06:37:09
463,[Rant] Emaths failure,"Hi lol, tdy is my EM p2 and I must say i did not perform to the best of my abilities. My EM p1 was arnd 45-50/73 (so arnd b4) BUT I counted my marks for EM p2 and I must say, when given leniency, it’s around 40+/91. I’m fucking scared I will fail my Emaths and cannot head to poly Or Mi.

At first I was happy because my prelims was a f9 and I must say that it’s a big jump to my current marks but in essence it’s bittersweet.

upon finishing the paper, i was just emotionless, I couldn’t cry nor could I relate to anyone because my circle of friends are those “emaths gods” that legit nvr study but can attain good grades and that I can testify to and in O’s they all estimated a B3 and above so yea. Though I’ll like to just deviate myself and just start walking home, I’m sure I’ll be the topic of discussion / be made the laughing stock because I’ve been known to be bad at emaths so I just stand there acting like everything is okay and just saying “oh yea I got that too.” 

Some quote on quote sentences my kind friends has left for me:

“emaths not easy get A1/2 because must get high percentage, but if u english get A1/2 only at most 75% la why u want flex for what? This useless subject lol emaths is for smart people”

“Why u come to sch so early to study? You failing anyways”

*gives me a complicated Emaths or even Amaths qns* “eh emaths god, can help me anot? I quite stupid , don’t know how to do maths “ and it often ends with the fucking class laughing at me And all I could do is laugh back and “haha fuck u sia”

“Which college? Oh no JC, I mean CW/CC/CE. U think u can pass O’s meh?”

“Walao the emaths paper so hard sia, I only got Arnd 65/73 for p1 gg ITE alr.” Blatantly just tells me while staring at me with a grin

“Your emaths so shit, u think u can succeed in life meh? I think best go visit heaven or find someone to support u lol”

“Why u in express? I think MOE accidentally put u here, you should be in NT.”

“Bro just asking ah, are u just not good in emaths only or are u just autistic because I lowkey can’t tell hahah no offence✨”

“Why u in (insert my sch name)? U should be in Metta or crest right?”

- what’s most hurtful about this snide remarks are that , these remarks are made by my circle of friends who just come to me for help in English and I obviously tried my best to help them and during this period of time, they all suddenly so kind and all, say thank you and never mock me LOL and I didn’t even flex my eng grades to them but they just blatantly flex it to my face as if I’m supposed to lick their boots and be like “wah so smart sia, I can never get this kind of marks because I’m fucking stupid hahahahahahhahahahha” I do my utmost best to help them. What do I get in return? Them mocking me for being stupid in emaths instead of returning the favour and helping me.

-I might get hate for this but I lowkey hope they fail english with a E8 (high chance) since they need a D7 to go poly then if I pass my emaths, I’ll fucking laugh in their faces and throw out all the snide remarks i have in me and just laugh hysterically at their pathetic grades.(I have a rather sharp tongue but I don’t use it often because I understand how people would feel if I hurl insults at them) 
 I mean , I’m jus repeating the debt they have left me over the past year right? No harm in it anyways~ they do that to me on the daily and feel nothing so why should I? Why should I care if u cry because u fail O’s? Why? Do I need to console you? No I don’t think so haha , im fine with just laughing at your faces anyways~ it’s the last time I see them so might as well right? I know somewhere in my life, I’ll eventually have to deal with karma but I don’t really care at this point already. As a matter of fact, I really do think that I should be entitled to mock their results if it turns out to be worse than mine

- Just letting this all out because its getting hard to deal with this in the midst of O’s and I’m scared I might trip and don’t attain my desired L1R4 : below 15

-if you’ve read this far, thank you for reading and may your life be filled with everlasting happiness and those taking o’s jiayou~

note: sorry for the shit grammar in this post lol no mood to try and correct anyth :/ it’s hella messy too hais

Edit: omo thanks for all the awards HAHA I just wanted to rant but I didn’t think it would attract so many people and now I’m feeling embarrassed telling this story here. Makes me sound like a wuss HAHA and yes I’m getting better and still progressing as per Normal for O’s and sorry if I didn’t reply u because I’m trying to cut my screen time but ILL BE SURE TO DO SO AFTER O’s. ✨❣️",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jfdtdi/rant_emaths_failure/,True,2020-10-22 06:25:48

I'm more on the introverted side so studying alone have always sounded like a pretty fine idea to me until I deadass ended up spending the entirety of my overnight study session at the airpoint watching 6 x 1 hour-long documentaries about scorpions (long story, i was trying to revise for gp and.... don't ask).

465,[RANT] hard time having close friends ㅠㅠ,"using this burner account cause i dont want to embarass myself on my main account hhh 

Not related to studies but i hope there'd be ppl who relate w me,,, so I finally realized the importance of having close friends and realised I have no one to consider as my close friend. No one to hang out with, go uss etc. Literally. If I were in trouble and need help, other than my parents, I’d have no one to help me… not sure what I want to gain from writing this,, maybe to let out my frustration I’ve held in for the past 3 years??? 

So my sec school is the type where it’s a continuation from pri school where 99.9% of people you were friends with in primary school would be the same in secondary school. The classes in sec 1 were separated into two; those with PSLE score of 200+ and 199 below. All of the close friends I made in pri school went to the 200 one. Sitting recess together would be hard cause we were 5 in a group and the canteen isn’t so big, so I was often left out. It started out slow where I didn’t even realise we were drifting apart. 

But it was fine, and I became closer to another group of ppl. There were 5 ppl including me.  We were 5 until sec 2 when they started to leave this one girl out; she was always quiet like literally, she’d just be there. The 2 girls would make backhanded comments to this other girl and the girl drifted apart and became closer to another group (she became more open w them).

Fast forward to sec 3, my school divided the batch based on the subject combi which we chose which is either combs sci phy/chem or bio/chem. I was the only one in the group that chose phy/chem… our class sometimes ended different timings and sometimes our recess would be different times too. I remember there was one I waited Infront of the toilet (our meeting place) for my whole recess while little did I know their recess starts later than mine hhh

So long story short,, throughout those 2 years we drifted apart and I only kept in contact w one of the girls (let’s call her H) many would associate her a my best friend and when they saw me alone, they’d ask me where H is. Funny thing is, out only communication was IG dms and we only exchanged memes and sometimes H2H talks (me only, never her)

What makes me the most sad is that in those 2 years we were friends, she had never wished me happy birthday. Seriously, the only thing I wish for the most was to have her wish me happy birthday. In sec 2, I got my braces done the day before my birthday and pretty sure she forgot my birthday. Do you know how it feels that ur other classmates which u happy birthday but none of ur close friends did?? I really am not expecting much but every year, I’d give her small gifts such as a pack of pens she wanted and really did not expect anything in return other than her wishing me.

Going to other people too seemed awkward cause people usually associate me w H and if were to find other ppl, they'd think we fought of smthg hhh so i just made friends w a classmate and just kept contact w H

Now I’m in poly and somehow I made friends w the popular clique in class and was in a gc w them but I always decline hanging aft school to study so ig they made another gc. I mean im not salty or anything cause I’ll be changing classes next sem but I’d like to make a close friend,, my messaging apps are literally so empty and im kinda getting lonely hhh its hard for me to make friend too cause I find those who contact me during lessons to ask for  help or info that has been said damn annoying",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ijbj0i/rant_hard_time_having_close_friends_ㅠㅠ/,True,2020-08-31 03:55:49
466,[rant] I fucked up my Chinese Os,"So tdy I just did my oral ⚰️⚰️⚰️I’ve never felt this amount of embarrassment before.Like I thought I could pull it off with like decent sentences but I really just flopped. THE FACT THAT I WAS GIVE FALSE HOPE BECAUSE PPL BEFORE ME LOOKED SO HAPPY. But I walked in , SHAKING , sat down looked at the passage which I couldn’t read fluently. When they asked the questions, I was just spitting words instead of sentences. I did prepare in the exam room, I did, but I prepared the wrong facts. The video was about rugby, and the narrator was talking abt strength and teamwork and values.So Ofc I thought about how teamwork is impt and all. But came hurricane katrina , they asked how I would feel if I was the person in the video playing rugby? LIKE OK I GET IT ITS A BASIC QUESTION BUT SINGAPORE RARELY SHOWS ANY RUGBY RELATED THINGS??? so all I could was that I would feel proud since this sport is not easy. 
Then second question asked about teamwork or  how the school could contribute smth along that , so I thought “ oh it is my time to shine”BUT SIKE. Because I stuttered so badly, till the fact that idek what I was talking about. MY MIND CONSTANTLY BLANKING OUT AND NOT RMBRINF HOW TO SAY WORDS LIKE SPORTS or Like obstacles and challenges.
Third question, always the hardest for me. They asked abt Singapore sports players ability to go overseas for Olympics?? Ofc I said yes , and bs abt how we have so many races in sg but I didn’t phrase it correctly so the teacher didn’t understand what I was saying. Hence she had to repeat and ask me again then I just said yes and talked abt the same thing until she asked me to give example. Number one example, Joseph Schooling, no shit, but we can’t talk in english so beidsmsnskq but I still ended up saying it in EL. Had to bs my way thru this entire oral especially towards the end. I could feel the laughing energy from the Teachers in front of me, it really sucks to be unable to converse chinese and manage my nervous system.

468,[O LEVELS] helping any candidates taking ss/hist!,"hey everyone! apparently my previous post blew up and i was surprised to receive many dms about this, so i decided to create a link for all of you to access the sbq/essay folder that i created for my o-level revision! (pls pm me for the link and provide me ur email address in adv tq!) 

there are 2 main folders. the sbq folder consists of :

1. IMPT! consolidated sbq skills with golden advice from one of the redditors here last year (but i made some edits and highlights to it so it is easier for you to take note!)
2. in-depth explanation of each sbq skill (just in case u still don't understand whats going on)
3. LEVEL UP! handling political cartoons & textual sources with literary understanding (optional and only advised to read IF your basic sbq skills are strong enough and wish to craft out a deeper analysis)

the essay folder would then consist of the impt pointers to take note for ss srq and hist seq respectively. ultimately seq and srq have some differences, esp ss srq (a). also included essay guides for theme 1: citizenship and governance + theme 3: globalisation

\*RULE OF THUMB: PLEASE. ANSWER. THE. QUESTION. DIRECTLY.\* OMG. WRITE BIG BIG AT THE START OF UR QUESTION PAPER TO ATQ. EVERY SINGLE PAGE. You don't want to be writing a perfect argument, only to realise u didn't follow the question stem. gone case.

just some general tips would be:

1. do NOT jump straight into writing. usually students who do this end up crafting a flawed analysis full of misinterpretations and over-generalisations. instead, learn to understand the question by identifying the type of question and yardstick first. then, READ the title of the case study and background information (PLEASEEEEEE it gives u some context uwu). subsequently, proceed to analyse the main source.
2. add-on from tip 1: do not be overly ambitious and spend too much time giving a full analysis for each question. you will most likely run out of time. leave the highest level analysis out first, and only go back to it to strengthen ur paragraph after ur done with ALL sections.
3. finishing the paper is KEY. u CANNOT afford to leave an entire question BLANK, be it sbq or essay. which is why it is so impt for u to keep drilling by doing timed practices and realise which sections/type of questions exactly need more attention. but since time is tight, i'd suggest to REVIEW your previous mistakes and papers instead (you definitely do not want to make the same mistake in o-levels).
4. some teachers, or rather you may be more comfortable with doing the srq or sbq (e) first. however, keep track of time. i included the recommended duration for each type of question in the consolidated sbq folder. be disciplined and do not exceed time limit. even one minute makes a difference.
5. you most likely wouldn't have time to check your work after the paper (and ur hands shd be breaking aldy lol). so u need to be very certain of what you are writing. if you realised ur argument goes off-tangent, there goes ur time for other questions. so plan by analysing (tip 1).

ultimately, sleep EARLY before the paper. do NOT cramp any more content. its supposed to be light revision during this period of time. you cannot afford to burn yourself out, and only not being able to perform competently in the examinations due to ur lack of sleep/concentration. the thing about ss/hist is really to exhibit ur SHARP analysis and understanding towards the issue raised in the case study/essay. knowing content is only half the battle won, so don't expect to get an A by merely regurgitating content. mastering ur skills is key too.

don't spot topics as well because if the topic u studied for doesn't come out, you will panic. for ss, make sure you at least have adequate understanding for all 3 themes. for hist, the minimum requirement would be to study the 4 key sbq topics: stalin, hitler, kw, cmc.

all the best!

ps if u need me to give any feedback on ur practices or extra tips for sbq/essay skills, feel free to dm me as well!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jgkqg7/o_levels_helping_any_candidates_taking_sshist/,True,2020-10-24 02:42:29

470,[O Levels] Push on because you've come so far,"Subj comb
Amath, Emath, Eng, SS/His, Bio, Chem, Chinese


Hello guys. Just want to post this because I've been seeing alot of people posting rants about Os. It is stressful, and I'm bloody proud that all of you guys are pushing on with it.

Recently did an Amath paper and had a mental breakdown while doing it. Reason was because I could not take F math as a Bio Chem student , so I could not focus while doing it. It was painful. I could not deal with that and ended up not doing many questions. But I decided to push because... What if that happened to me during O level amath? It was quite stressful lah. Amath is my best subject and the thought of not getting A1 for it killed me inside. For 30 minutes, I just died inside while forcing myself to write my answers. Through some miracle, my sanity kicked back in and I blitzed through in the last 30 minutes. I got 84, losing 5 marks to careless and units.



I am not a smart student, and like many of you suffer from feeling inferior or stupid. My grades last year are a far cry from where I am now. L1R5 of 25, tired and distressed as anyone could be. I pushed on despite all my setbacks. Amath was C6 C5 F9 B4. This year... Consistent A1s for mock papers and tests. 

Chem went downhill... Now im confident as heck because I clarified my doubts.

We have all grown in some way or another. Some of us may feel depressed, distressed or even disheartened owing to our grades. Truth be told, grades are important. However, to see unique and special people like you all hurt inside hurts me because we have all come so far... Don't give up now!


I love all of you guys. Next 2 months are going to be dogshit but I believe we will all continue to grow and hopefully prosper.

To quote a song I adore and would like to share
'We are lightyears away from where we stood. Don't let yourself give up.' 
Far away by Tristam and Braken. 

Cheers!

473,[Rant] Uni taught me...,"Do share your experiences too! 

Officially ended Year 1 (paiseh trimester based uni a bit slow). Here are 11 lessons I learnt from the past 11 months:

1. Not everyone knows your struggles. Those who know may not (genuinely) care.

2. Don't take things too personal. Learn to forgive and let go (yea saying is easier than doing).

3. People come & go. You will meet a lot of temporary people. It's not your fault or within your control.

4. Don't be too comfortable with being too comfortable. But also don't be overly pressured to step out of your comfort zone. You are not defined by your achievements. 

5. Be the reason someone feels seen, heard and supported. Be kind to everyone for one day you will need/appreciate someone's kindness too.

6. If something is out of your hands, it deserves freedom from your mind too.

7. Fake people exists. Have the courage to stay true to yourself. There are still real and genuine people out there (albeit rare).

8. Betrayals. Backstabs. Sabotages. They suck. But your response determines your outcome. Plotting a revenge will be fk up your emotions and mental health :'( They say the best revenge is to let go & live well...it's tough, I will try.

9. You deserve the love & effort you keep giving others. 

10. Stay strong even when everything seems to fall apart. 

11. Don't be too hard on yourself. Reward yourself. You're a work in progress.   


I am still struggling in certain areas but I'm still holding on to the hope that better days, months and years are ahead... <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i9lygp/rant_uni_taught_me/,True,2020-08-15 05:28:15
474,[O levels] Rant I screwed up chinese badly,"Context: In my school I’m in the worst class for chinese( because despite being in HCL for 6 years of my life I didn’t study chinese during Sec1-3)  but during Sec 4 I studied to study my ass off especially during CB 

 I went to the exam thinking it will be popular topic such as arts and culture. But no it was high elements (rock climbing, flying fox eg ) which I have no seen in my life (as in in Chinese notes) During The examination I took 5 minutes to read the reading passage because I don’t know how to read half the passage. During the oral examination I asked the teacher to repeat the qn 3 times 3 times !!! I started crying during the reading passage part because I know I will screw up chinese badly. And during the time I can’t even read one sentence coherently. It sucks so much because I memorised and studied every single topic that can be tested and every single assement book in popular during the circuit breaker. So much so when I test myself I can give the model answer word for word.  I screwed up paper 1 and paper 2 for chinese so badly as well :( (especially the water question) I know I will flunk Chinese for sure and honestly I will be surprised even I pass chinese with a B4. I’m just very demorlaised now and I don’t find it fair  that the ppl in front of it get much easier questions. (Like cyber bullying etc) It also sucks because I know I will flunk LC as well because I overthink :( 

I have no more hope for chinese at all. I want to go to an elite jc (VJC: arts) really badly but after this I know it’s not possible  because they’ll look at my overall grades so even if i get 6 A1s I won’t be accepted. I overlay just feel pissed that my oral was postponed and I got the most hard questions. Even the Lao Shi gave me a sorry look when I literally started having a meltdown.

i've been feeling this way for a few months, i think since prelims started in august. i have always felt lonely since then because that was when everyone started mugging hardcore for o levels. i didn't do well for prelim, i got 41 points and i accepted that because i was always at the bottom of the cohort and did nothing to improve until the end. i knew it was my fault and i was struggling the entire time. especially during that study break between prelims and o level, i was going for hours of consultations and staying in school from morning to evening to study on my own. some days i had one classmate who was there with me and i'm really grateful for her and i don't blame my friends for not wanting to study with me because i would have slowed them down though but i really couldn't help but to feel so lonely :(

o levels itself was difficult for me too, everyday i was wondering whether i'll even be able to go anywhere and was coming back home crying after every period. it was a difficult period and i was really excited for o level to end and have fun and all

but two weeks after Os ended, my family was supposed to go overseas for a holiday that we have been planning for since june and i was really looking forward to it but my grandma died the day before we were supposed to fly :( she died from stroke alone at her house. when i saw her, all i saw was a cold dead body and blood and it was so traumatizing. i'm still crying over her death and i feel so miserable but i dont know how to be okay again

the rest of the holidays passed by blurry i dont really remember anything, i was just at home and sad. results day came by and i was happy because i managed to go from passing 2/6 subjs to 5/6 subjs, which was enough for me. managed to join MI and was looking forward to it for a fresh start...

but i dont know. i really dont regret going there, i got into a cca i liked, i met some really nice people but im so exhausted and tired... like i said i'm really dreading to go to sch... i'm the only person in my sch who went there. the daily commute from one of the estates in the east to bukit batok is really really tiring and i just want to stop😭😭😭 i just want to give up😭 also after a month of school i moved to a new house. we moved to take care of grandma because she had dementia and some other health issues but she died before we could move and our new house is so near to her house (i can see her block when i look out of my house) and it makes me feel so sad everyday... :( it doesnt help that i still do not have a friend group and i dont really have anyone that i can talk about more personal stuff too... all my close friends from sec sch went to the same few jcs in the east and theyre all so happy and it hurts everytime i open ig and see them all together

i feel like i've lost interest in everything i hate everything that i used to like in sec sch like mt lessons pe lessons and recess because i dont have friends. everytime after lessons i just sit in the library and either cry or tear up because i thought of how i've never felt this way before in sec sch and i felt so sad... i miss my friends and i feel so lonely... i know its kind of my fault that i dont have friends because i somewhat isolate myself... talking to people has became so tiring and i find it so damn difficult to make friends with anyone... :( its so tiring i talk to someone for awhile then i have no energy anymore and i just give up. now during recess i choose not to eat too because i dont know i would just rather go lib

i dont know guys thank you if you've read until here i just really feel so horrible i've been crying everyday its so hard to adapt and cope and accept my fact that my grandma is dead and that i have a new school and new house and no friends and all these changes are so overwhelming for me. im so tired and i want to just not bother about anything but i chosw to do a levels to prove myself wrong that im not useless worthless hopeless like i think i am but at this point of time im really just really so close to giving up

tldr ; dread gg to sch, sad and lonely, no friends, new sch is alm 2 hours away from home, just moved to new house, grandma died, miserable all the time

edit ; i forgot to add but ive been going for school counselling for almost a month but recently my counsellor said that she suspects i have depression and would like to refer me to external parties. thing is, i'm scared because i have my own doubts and if i do get referred outside, def my parents have to know. im not sure if they really understand what depression is. honestly, i just want to talk to someone who can relate or understand how i feel like now, or someone who can share with me how seeking help for depression is like :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqi47p/a_levels_sad_and_lonely_how_to_not_dread_school/,True,2020-03-29 03:04:23

477,[Rant] My pathetic love life,"I know now is a very emotional time for the j2s who completed As and so I would like to say congratulations for enduring years of education in a crazy country AHAH. 

But this post is unfortunately about my sad and pathetic love life....I wholeheartedly apologise for this. Anyway I’m a j1 whose first year in jc will end tomorrow (thankfully got promoted!!!) and yeah I just felt this sudden wave of sadness when I think about my love life. 

Truthfully, when I first stepped foot into jc, I never really spared a serious thought about having relationships. Then the normal yet random loneliness got the best of me and the sight of couples mugging together made me lowkey jealous. It’s been almost a year (???!!!) since I’ve been here and I legit got sad thinking about how no one found me attractive at all LOL I know that looks is literally the least important thing I need to think about while studying for A’s but hey let a girl wallow in her sadness okay....

Anyway fast forward it is now literally the second last day of school and I have been planning to approach this one guy who I think seems nice. I actually gathered the tiny grains of courage in me to approach him just not but GUESS WHAT? You’re right I just let him pass by....(granted he was from the toilet and with his friends so maybe it wasn’t the best timing but still...) 

So yeah, I don’t know what to do now. Thank you to anyone who read this till the end. I know this is anything but important right now hahaha but it feels great to let it all out ngl 🥱",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k1ax6r/rant_my_pathetic_love_life/,True,2020-11-26 23:37:31

480,[Uni] For those of you who are planning to apply to the UK this year,"The UK government has just massively inflated the predicted A level grades of only UK students by allowing them to use teachers' predictions (https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53810655 - This was after Scotland, Wales and NI did the same).

As a result of the grade inflation, a large number of students have been awarded ridiculously (and imo some unfairly) high grades. England's exam watchdog has warned that this could mean 38% of students are awarded A* and A grades (https://www.bbc.com/news/education-53764313). For the record, the previous high was 27%.

Expect competition for UK unis to be very stiff this year, especially with the fact that unis are probably oversubscribed due to an unusually large intake for the 2020-21 academic year, and can only afford a smaller intake for future years. Bear in mind that when there is competition for places, foreign applicants tend to get the short end of the stick.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ibr76b/uni_for_those_of_you_who_are_planning_to_apply_to/,True,2020-08-18 17:08:29
481,"[Uni] Singaporean students in the USA, with the announcement of the ICE measures against students who have online classes for the entire semester, what are your options?","The USA has just announced that all students on F-1 visa whose colleges or universities have announced a completely online semester must leave the country post-Thanksgiving, and incoming freshmen are not allowed to enter the country unless they have face-to-face classes. For T-20 universities such as Princeton and Harvard who have announced completely online semesters come Fall, you will almost definitely have to return to Singapore or face arrest and deportation. This is an incredibly worrying and wholly unethical move by the USA and will affect many of our brightest Singaporean youths who are trying to pursue an education in the States.

482,[RANT] How do I deal with parents who are not understanding??,"I’ve been feeling quite depressed for a while, ever since I got rejected by all the unis I applied to. I have a borderline gpa with a slightly decent portfolio so I was quite shocked that I wasn’t accepted into any uni at all, even if I met the cutoff for last year. However, I tried to pick myself up and tell myself that the competition is just more intense this year and I should take a gap year to improve on my portfolio so that I can try again next year.

The problem is, my parents have never been understanding towards my issues. When they heard about my situation, the first thing they said was about how I never put in effort into anything and my shitty results is probably why I cant get a placement. They have never been through tertiary education so they don’t know what is GPA and how the admissions requirements are like. So when they found out that I wasn’t able to get into any local uni, they immediately thought it was because I did not do well for my exams and basically started pointing out all the faults they could find in me and making me feel even more shitty than I already do. I don’t even know how to begin to explain to them how competitive it is this year due to multiple factors and admissions aren’t based on just grades alone. They also kept pushing me to find a full time job, which I’m already trying to do although I am having difficulty finding one when most companies suspended their hiring processes. The thing is, I’m actually already working multiple part time jobs related to the degree I was interested in. They’re aware I’m currently working part time. And yet they still continue pushing me to find a full time job for what? So i can be even more stressed by juggling full time and multiple part time jobs at the same time? I told them its hard to find a job outside now and their response is just basically saying that I’m not trying hard enough.

I don’t dare to hope for them to be understanding towards my issues but I just want them to leave me alone. I’m already depressed enough because I felt inadequate for not being able to get into local u. And after what my parents said to me, I feel even more worthless as a person. I don’t take allowance from them and they don’t pay for my education fees either. So I don’t understand what gives them the right to be so controlling over me when I’m already an adult and they’ve never been through the same education pathway as I did so they have no right to say I don’t work hard enough just because I don’t show them that Im trying my best. To be honest, I’ve been thinking of cutting ties with them in the future because I can no longer deal with how toxic they are. It’s messing with my mental health a lot. I could be having a good day but if they are feeling irritable they’ll start snapping at me and saying i’m useless out of nowhere and then start having an one sided rant about all the dissatisfaction they have with me. And it really hurts me badly whenever they do that. I tried shutting out their shoutings but I can never forget the pain they caused me.

Am I in the wrong for getting rejected by all the unis I applied to?? For those who took a gap year or got rejected by all the local u this year too, how did you manage to make your parents understand your plight?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h9jmxc/rant_how_do_i_deal_with_parents_who_are_not/,True,2020-06-16 08:29:57
483,"[Uni] Don’t lose hope completely, but start preparing for the worst","TLDR:  The purpose of this post is not to showboat my success. Rather, it is to remind you to not lose complete hope but also begin your preparations for the worst during your uni acceptance window.

I’m about to enter Uni this year and I fully understand what some of you guys are going through during this period of Uni application. I was never the smartest student, just your average Poly student. Graduating with a cGPA of 3.62, I knew I was going to have a hard time entering the “big 3”. Back in 2018, I applied for SUSS as a backup and was accepted eventually. However, my goal was to enter SMU Business. When I applied for SMU Biz, the 90th percentile was 3.73 but I wanted to try my luck. I applied and waited till the last day of window acceptance on 24th May, prior to the opening of the second window to receive my results. 

Thankfully, I got to the school and course I wanted from the start. 

As each day of the results window shortens, I feel that one should start drafting your appeal letter, look for alternatives,especially courses you can apply during the second application window. Talk to your family and friends, share your rants here, seek counselling if needed. Remember, It is not the end of the world if you don’t get into the course you want. Allow yourself to take a breather before settling on your possible options you can further take. You can even take gap years to churn out the work experience as well as project involvement for future uni applications. Life is a long road, please avoid making rash decisions when you meet an obstacle. Don’t let this one failure or obstacle define you. I’m sure you haven’t seen the best in yourself just yet.

Let me end off this lengthy post with a quote from Jack Ma: “ Never give up. Today is hard, tomorrow will be worse, but the day after tomorrow will be sunshine.”",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ghr54l/uni_dont_lose_hope_completely_but_start_preparing/,True,2020-05-12 08:42:52
484,[Uni] Some cons about NTU I wish I knew before entering,"Hi guys, I’m currently in nbs acc and I just wanted to share some cons abt ntu that I didnt know prior to entering. Seniors or schoolmates pls feel free to add on!

1. Ntu’s S/U system.

We can only S/U electives (UE/GERPE) and and must choose the S/U option before we get our exam results. This is quite different from NUS’s s/u system cos they can s/u after seeing their results and can also s/u year1 core modules (i think) that is not a prerequisite to anything

2. Ntu’s hall fees.

Ntu’s hall fees may seem a lot lower than nus’s hall fees but bear in mind that theirs includes meal plans. For ntu, its exclusive of food. Also, we have to pay for hall during winter break even if you are not intending to stay. So ur basically paying 1.5month worth of hall fees for absolutely nothing unless u stay in sch for IHG or other sch activities. So this amounts to $400+? They give u the option of moving out but they dont guarantee u a spot in hall once the 2nd sem starts. One of my friends moved out during winter and he failed to secure a hall spot for sem2, which means he has to travel everyday to sch so yeahhhhhh",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fbsqza/uni_some_cons_about_ntu_i_wish_i_knew_before/,True,2020-03-02 03:20:30

486,[O LEVELS] FOR THOSE STRUGGLING,"Hello, as you all know o levels are coming up and i had been noticing that most of the students who rant here are the ones struggling despite putting a lot of effort(which i presume) and that most of them are just redoing their tys over and over again.. Now im not really in a good position to share my opinion or advice you guys as i am a lazy person irl however, that laziness has made me come up with different easier ways in which one can obtain a decent score without putting much effort. It is up to you whether or not you want to believe what i say.

Some important factors that i noticed are: 
- Overdoing their tys too much
- overworking themselves to much(Burnt out)
-Not taking down notes properly

What i am trying to say is that all of those things that you guys have done are wrong in certain ways if you are not getting results.

Overdoing TYS:
You should revise back your basics and chapters first before attempting the TYS that way, you are able to find out which area you are lacking or chapters you don’t fully understand the concept. 

-Some people think that attempting their TYS while studying is better for them(If you are seeing improvement then fine), however it is not very efficient as you would take a much longer time trying to search through the certain topic on that Qn.

Overworking themselves;
Many students start studying really early which could last about 5-8 hours even on weekdays.... This would ultimately just burn you out. I suggest that you start around your mid year as that is plenty of time to cover all the topics.. I personally study 1-2 days before the exam as i have already understood the concepts as i pay attention in class and all that is needed is to revise back all the topics. As we are at the stage of prelims, i suggest that you minimise your studying if you had been studying since day 1.

Not taking down notes properly; 
This is a common mistakes i see amongst my hardworking friends as they basically just write down what is in the textbook word for word,this would only burden yourself as it would be harder to revise all of it. I suggest that you understand the concept and jotting down the main or important points in a way that your brain would click when you see the word. E.g rephrasing the words.

I am not sure if you guys were able to understand all of that since i have a very hard time trying to explain what i am thinking to other people some times, but if you have any questions regarding what i just said above, do msg or reply to me.

491,[RANT] Love.,"I was sec5 during that time when i met my ex-girlfriend(H), we met in church yay so happy so fun. We started off as friends then we upgraded our status to boyfriend and girlfriend. We were happy at first, we hangout once a week, holidays probably twice a week, texted everyday(Though i was dam tired to text everyday rather write letters lol kidding) We were happy honestly. The problems started to surface when we were dating for about 2 months. We were 'discovered' by our church members. And once we were 'discovered' rumours started to spread that we were together(yes we were). Both of us wanted to hide our status(including parents) and we agreed on lying to them(church members) when they asked about it. We were stressed and overwhelmed by it. Our agreement to lie about status fell. H decided to tell the truth and I decided to tell the lie. Yes, it was mess. Everything just fell apart from there. Whether it was lie or truth, rumours spins up like a crazy tornado into the sky in church. Everyone now knew something about it. Everytime, when i went to church i would always felt very jittery, scared for being judge and scared of people gossiping. I was just freaking out and nervous. No one cared about how i felt. I thought church is a safe place. I thought they would journey with me. H and I started to quarrel more often and often. I felt betrayed too because she always tell everything i say to her like my thoughts and stuff to her Best Friend(D). Why do u need tell D? Why?Why cant you keep to yourself? I was also stressed out by her too. She would example why u always sleep so early, why cannot sleep late and chat with me? ranting to me about her family members and friends example, you know that xxx so annoying sia even that ggg also dont like her. I need space to tell you about my life too! Unexpectedly O lvl was the least concern. Then we went for a 'break' then i thought it was a break up leh I thought break is like a easier way to say break up, D told me break and break up different, break is still together but not talking and break up means not together and not talking. idk ape ini honestly. Then, after a few days we began talking again and what we were back? But then, we started quarreling haiyo and going out and have fun yay again. The turning point was when i went to church just like any other day and suddenly like a few leaders decided to invite me for dinner. During the dinner, one of them was threatening me to remove (H) from leadership because of the rumours about (H) and I, he was basically telling us to break up. I was angry and confused. How could they do this to her? What am i going to do? I dont want (H) to lose like this leadership thingy in church and i still want the relationship. How? I couldnt turn to anyone for help. I discussed it with (H) about what we should do about it. She just replied IDK. I cant believe it man! And i told her my suggestion that we break up for a while and date next year? I mean love is more than just the status. Love is through actions. She said Okay. A few days later, oh wow I got this revelation from God that this relationship couldnt go on anymore and dont wait for me. I am like what?!! I was mad! I got blamed for breaking up by her friends and my close friends in church didnt support me too. My school friends dont know about it because i didnt tell them. But i still put on that freaking mask to school and church everytime, always happy go lucky, I didnt want anyone to know about it. I asked myself why me? why did such things happen to me? I come from a broken family too, only my mother and I, i just cant bring myself to telling her about it. I was all alone.

492,[JC] Feeling empty,"hello.. recently, i've been getting that feeling of emptiness which also includes feeling unmotivated to do anything. this emptiness sometimes brings sadness and ive only been feeling like this this year. im j1 so idk if its coz of jc's stressful/sian life, or becoz of the covid shit going on and all the CB and HBL periods making me feel so alone. even though i talk to my mum quite openly, ive nvr talked much abt my emotions.. and even though my mum is working frm home these days, i still feel the same. i think its because i stay in my room most of the time. im actually an ambivert (both introvert and extrovert) but becoz of cb i feel like my introverted side is showing out more ?? like i feel the most comfortable when i stay in my own room. 

when i feel empty i feel like doing nothing haiz. just needed to get this out of my chest. leave some comments if u hv the same problem/if u hv any advice :DD",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hxkvqh/jc_feeling_empty/,True,2020-07-26 02:57:08

I'm mad at SEAB, SEAB 
They tricked me, tricked me
Had me wishing for an L1R5<10
But now I'm scoring twenty-something
I still know nothing from TYS
About what I know or what I don’t 
So call me a pessimist
But I don't believe in bell curve
Finding a good grade is bullsh-
'Cause I felt sad love
I felt tired love
Sometimes dumb love (happy love)
Turns into giving up (giving up)
I felt hurt love
About SEAB love (lol no)
What the hell is good grades supposed to feel like?
What the hell is A1? What the hell is A1?
What the hell is A1  supposed to feel like?

496,[Rant] Sick of online classes,"As much as I enjoy not doing journey to the west everyday , staying at home is starting to make me lose a lot of motivation due to the environment.

&#x200B;

In one of my modules, the lecturer does not even conduct lessons anymore. He just calls us to mark our attendance and the rest of the lessons are thrown onto youtube. While I do not mind it, one of the things that irks me is how often youtube keeps giving out ads out of nowhere while Im in the middle of doing an assignment. I just want to watch the video, submit my work and be done, not keep seeing unnecessary ads mid lesson. Another thing annoying about it is that I go onto BB and be greeted with 16 tasks to do within 3 hours and I just shut myself down immediately before even touching the models.

In another module,We don't get any breathers, after the submission of one assignment, the following week a new assignment just launches and we are expected to be working on it immediately. And just like the module mentioned above, this lecturer does not conduct lessons either, just throws the videos on youtube and expect us to understand everything.

&#x200B;

I have not been listening in classes nor doing my assignments anymore, I just call in, mark myself as present then proceed to sleep unless there's consultations. I feel so shitty of myself and guilty because I kept saying that I want to buck up and save my gpa but I just can't bring myself to do it no matter how much I force myself to do so.

497,[Uni] Mass Telegram Groupchats Prior to University Orientation,"tldr; thinking of creating tele group chats for faculty/courses to compliment uni orientations! thoughts?

hi everyone! in view of the covid-19 situation, it is highly probable that university orientations will be cancelled/ moved online. hence, i thought of an idea to create telegram group chats for the respective faculties/courses in the respective universities in sg! it’s honestly a rough idea for now, but i thought it would be a good platform for students to get to know their batch mates better!! i’m thinking of materializing this idea sometime in may when most have gotten their offer so that it’ll be more inclusive for everyone!! so i have some questions to ask prospective students:

1: what do you think of this idea? are you in support of it?

2: would you prefer to have group chats based on courses or faculty? i’m worried that if it’s based on courses there will be too many links HAHAHA

3: any suggestions / questions regarding the telegram group chat? (do ask ur qns under the comments section so redditors who have similar qns can read through as well && i’ll do my best to reply to every qn! ++ i welcome constructive criticism)

important notice: if everyone is receptive to this idea i will do my best to materialize it and run it smoothly! for now it’s just a random thought LOL. if successful i will put up another post & hopefully get the moderators(?) to pin it HAHAHAH. the post will have the links to the various group chats organized according to the university! as it can be q tedious to create the group chats & run everything i hope y’all will understand if problems arise :”)) 

ps. please upvote this post or share this with ur peers as well to ask them for their opinions!! as this is a pretty large scale project it’ll be good to have a large sample of feedback & suggestions!! 

pps. if they don’t have reddit, you can also view my post on ig: @victcriax and share to them through ig if it’s more convenient for you/them!

Alright so day after day of hellish papers, everytime I open reddit and see many people complaining about how they are pretty much done for, I feel a sense of brotherhood since we're on the same boat

But when I read some of them, my face changes.

I know everyone have different expectations, but do know that there is always someone with one higher/lower than yours. 

When u say something like 'i cannot get my 85rp anymore ' or 'my AAA/B seems unimaginable 😨'

mannn people aiming 70ish rp may feel even worse after seeing your post. For people like me, who come a mid-tier jc and perform average or worse than that( e.g. DED/E ), we dont hope for stuff like 85 rank points but just enough

Everytime we read how you guys struggle to score As, damn our hopes do take a hit.

500,[rant] one day before my exams and i can't remember anything,"mention of suicide attempt here!! please don't read if it's a trigger of yours v____v





i got hospitalised for a suicide attempt last tuesday and i went back to school on thursday to take my wa3, absolutely screwed up my history paper because i was still high off my painkillers (literally wrote one PEEL paragraph and spaced out afterwards) and now my anxiety is super bad because i genuinely cannot remember any of the subjects that ive mugged for.

 ive spent at least 5 hours trying to do a business entities question and in the end i only wrote one line on the ledger paper. 
not to mention that i have to go back to imh on thursday for a follow-up which makes it even worse because ill have less time for my art coursework which ive missed the entire last week.

 my subject teachers especially my history and poa cher dislike me because they keep saying that i don't pay attention in class but the thing is i literally have adhd which makes it difficult for me to concentrate and now they're preventing me from going for consultation/remedial with them because ""they don't help students that don't understand the format of basic awaco/general journal"" and im super, fucking, stressed and anxious.

i don't want to tell my friends that i attempted suicide. i told them that i had gastric but it's getting harder to talk to them knowing that they'll feel burdened with me. 

it's getting harder to even get out of bed anymore. i don't have the energy to even read my notes and having people in school (ie teachers) that keep telling me im lazy and a good for nothing is making everything worse. i keep trying my best but i keep failing and i don't know what im doing wrong anymore .",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hp889f/rant_one_day_before_my_exams_and_i_cant_remember/,True,2020-07-12 03:05:37

I take BCMe ( H2 biology, chem and math / H1 econs, gp, pw &amp; chinese )

In terms of academics, yall probs know that no JC curriculum is easy. In YIJC, there is a wide variety of students - from students with L1R5 4nett to 20nett.
Hence you must be self-driven, be aware of your own standards and benchmark it with other JCs.

503,[O Levels] ‘freedom’ after Os,"hi guys. i know were supposed to be feeling happy, free, and just have no troubles after completing Os for the next few months. but since young my parents hahe always been the strictest parenrs on me. im 16, just completed Os. never ONCE was i allowed to go out to have lunch with my friends after school. im not allowed to attend any school events if its late. the only time im ever allowed to sfay late in school is for CCA, and im not even allowed to go for consultations during Os period if it wasnt compulsory. im not allowed out with my feiendsa, not allowed to even CALL or Video call with any of my friends. and not even allowed to talk to any boys. whenever i got caught, my phone would just be confiscated for months. My parents still occasionally check my phone without my permission and i have to ‘hand it up’ to them after 7pm every day. EVEN AFTER Os. after my pure chem paper 1 on wednesday i really thought all of this would change but no. im still forced to hand up my phone at 7pm daily, still not allowed to go out with my feiends ( I have very little friends because of this ), and not allowed to have calls or chats with the few feiends i have. I need help. I really feel so damn suffocated in this house and I just got scolded 10 minutes ago for ‘doing nothing’ at home. i mean. what do u want me to do? Im not allowed out, not allowed to chat with boys, and not even allowed to call anyone. Not allowed to even TOUCH my phone after 7pm which is why i always miss updates from my teachers as well whenever they send stuff in the group chat. I feel so sick. Its been 16 years and the reason they gave is becuase they want me to priotisie my studies but Os are over and nothing changed. if this has to go on even After sec school into poly, i really dont know how im gona take it. I really dont want to be friendless in poly if i tell people im not able to hang out with them after school. I feel so trapped and suffocated. no telling my teachers wont help all they say is rvery parent is different and they all mean well for you. thats bullshit. someone please help what can i do im really feeling so hopeless to the point i wish Os went on forever. i really dont mind studying till my brains wreck EVERYDAY as long as i get to leave the home for that few hours. As long as i get SOCIAL INTERACTION really anything is fine. i need help. please. all i ever wished for my entire secondary school period until now was to be able to hang out with my friends. not asking for much. even if theres a curfew i dont mind i just wish i can leave the house to meet witj my friends every once in a while. i see my other classmates going out every single day to anywhere some even travelling overseas together and i really just want to be there with them. i cry to myself every night literally so oftenly just because of this. i have great support from my few friends so thats not an issue but please help give me suggestions on what i can do. taking to my parents about it wouldnt help as ive tried befoee it just made them hate me more and control me more :”) hais.

edit: ive also thought of creating a scene like leaving home and getting a friend to call them to explain how miserable im feeling but i just dont have the guts to. and its really pointless they wouldnt understand.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jt9ntm/o_levels_freedom_after_os/,True,2020-11-13 19:24:38

507,[O levels] How you can view your results on results day,"It is a good day to all taking the 2020 O levels results today,  hours from now. Some of you might think of today as D-Day but let me share what I really think of this 'sacred' day. 

There are 3 types of people you should really know. 1st type, the one who is really anxious and panicking over his or her results before and after. It is normal to experience this as humans are fearful of the unknown however at this point you should just ask yourself this question,"" if I have done what I think I should have done before O levels(study more etc), will I still feel the same feeling as what I am feeling now?"" If your answer is yes then you should just really embrace your own efforts and acknowledged them because the past months/years of preparation for your O's have been your best preparation you could have ever done. Despite you feeling that you could have done more, which is a result of the ""fear of the unknown "" compounding to the ""I can do more"" effect. 

The other two types of people are the one who has high expectations and high hopes for their results and cannot afford to 'lose' and the one who genuinely does not expect much and takes their results with a truthful smile regardless of their scores because they understood that results don't define who you are and results are surely not everything,  though results matters to a certain extent. Be like the latter, because the one who aims for a L1R5 6 probably has been thinking about their results the past two weeks or longer, putting unnecessary stress on themselves.

Gist of everything : Feeling nervous before taking the results is totally understandable, but upon receiving the results, please, be grateful and pat yourself on the back for the intense effort and hard work compared to yourself that you have put in for this slip of paper. Because honestly, we are now at a junction point waiting to get our passes to go to different destinations, none is deemed bad unless you view it as bad. ~ Point of perspective is crucial to finding your life purpose and being a optimist or pessimist ~ Anonymous",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kursp6/o_levels_how_you_can_view_your_results_on_results/,True,2021-01-11 17:11:17

Elaborating for word count: 
This year due to Covid we’ll be collecting our results in class but honestly i dont really want my classmates to ask about my grades regardless of whether they’re good or not, and i’m not that competitive and keen to know theirs. How to deal with something like this when u have social anxiety?

Edit: 
SEAB did **not** explicitly state that it is necessary to show up on the day itself given that you are well (reference below), and this could imply that students are given a choice (? idk coz someone commented that they had a choice for ‘19 batch) i reckon more info would be given at a later date",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jwtaao/a_levels_info_on_results_release/,True,2020-11-19 17:34:26

Bathe by 6.30 again(have to bathe when I reach home or no entering the house) or no dinner, study in the living room only where she keeps on chatting and i cant focus, sleep by 10 when I’m trying to revise. Checking what i’m doing every 5 mins or so. I’m so done with all this random bullcrap she pulls, wanting to study and focus, but can’t even do just that cos she always has something she wants me to do, like type a text for her every 2mins about some random thing to her friend, when she herself can type as well as I can. Then I get my grades, say 30/40 for physics, then she scolds me for not getting the highest grade which is like 34/40. Last time I heard “well done” was like p2. 

Now, my grades all falling, cant find motivation to study. Im so fucking tired and cant catch a break. Ffs

However, one thing that we students desperately lack is still not open yet... Study Spaces! Let me paint a picture for you: Imagine you are at home, younger sibling bugging you everyday, parents doing house chores, vacuuming the floor, etc. The environment is simply not conducive! So you take your things and head to the Starbucks at TPY central only to find that it is already full with students who have the same issue as you but got there earlier. ""Early bird catches the worm,"" they all say. So you head to the library only to have your last sliver of hope shattered when the librarian says that the library is only open for borrowing and returning of books; no using of the study corners, etc. 

I'm sure that many students out there are in the same situation that I am in right now. My school library is not open so that option is out of the window. We don't want to study somewhere hot and humid as we do not fancy having our papers drenched in sweat, hence we are looking towards air-conditioned places to study. Are there any places that y'all would recommend? I'm not looking for cafés, libraries, those kinds of places. Are there places in Singapore that are open right now that allow students to study at that are air-conditioned and preferably quiet as well?

So, as a tutor, I often get questions from students on ""how to study for my \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ subject?""

Well, in terms of ""how to study"", I'm pretty sure many of you guys already receive plenty of tips for this: Create cheat sheets, conceptual frameworks, practice, etc., etc. I have already covered some examples of these methods for [studying H2 History](http://thediscourse.sg/education/how-to-study-h2-history/) or GP (the subjects for which I tutor) either in a previous Reddit post, or in my blog.

# ""HOW TO MEMORISE CONTENT?""

Okay, so, this will be a brief breakdown of how to do it. I have already covered this extensively in my blog post ""[How to study for A Levels content](http://thediscourse.sg/education/how-to-memorise-a-levels-content/)"", so please feel free to read the post for more details. (or even consult free suggested answers for GP and H2 History or free H2 History notes there!) The best way to memorise content, essentially, is to create a **mind palace**.

Fans of the TV show *Sherlock* may be familiar with this, as you would've seen this play out in the episode with the blackmailer Magnussen. To put it simply, if you just dead-as\* memorise stuff, (aka **rote memorisation**) it *may* work, but it will not be as effective. Why?

**Because you wouldn't be creating dynamic links between the content.**

This problem applies to nearly all subjects, regardless of whether you're an Arts student or Science student. Yet, the issue is that if you simply memorise the content in a manner that's topical, sure, you *could* remember stuff there. For e.g., if you tried memorising definitions of, say, Market Failure in H2 Econs, I'm certain that upon prompting you'd be able to produce those definitions verbatim.

However, what if I were to ask you this simple question, ""*What is the link between the concept of Scarcity and Market Failure?*"" Maybe you could produce the individual definitions, but it may be difficult to explain the links.

The bigger issue is that by extension, it becomes more difficult to conceptualise issues and to know **what examples to use for your essays or formula to use for maths questions**, etc.

So, to create mind palaces, you need to build **associations between words or concepts**, that will help you link facts together in a coherent manner. Incidentally, this is how you build a critical perspective of questions. By building these associations, you can then create pathways that may overlap with certain concepts and facts which will allow you to navigate and retrieve information from your mind easily.

At the same time, the issue is that the content for A Levels subjects often have overlapping concepts and facts. In which case, you need a guiding question to help you specifically recall said concepts and facts. ...well, that's what the exam questions are for!

For example, if, say, a H2 History student tries to recall facts for *the reasons for the failure of UN PKOs* and its ancillary examples. I'll illustrate a pathway that explains ONE concept and a FEW examples:

**UN Political Effectiveness -> PKO failure -> Due to Cold War bipolarity -> Ideological conflict between USA and USSR compelled a competition for spheres of influence -> UN becomes one arena -> PKOs are meant to maintain int'l peace and security -> Cold War bipolarity prevents the effective** ***implementation of measures to maintain said int'l peace and security*** **-> 1956 USSR veto of Draft Resolution 3730 which called for the cease and desist of Soviet armed intervention in Hungary (*****which is linked with de-Stalinisation and the eventual Sino-Soviet split!*****) -> OR Cold War bipolarity saw the** ***twisting of PKOs to suit superpower interests*** **-> ONUC 1960, Congo, USA supported Mobutu's coup, deposing Lumumba (who was perceived as pro-Soviet and Chinese) -> Mobutu eventually forced Soviet and Chinese ambassador -> ONUC used to keep the peace** ***while supporting Mobutu's regime and their suppression of the Katanga secession*** **-> etc., etc.**

When you build word- or conceptual-associations between all these facts and entrench it in your mind, info retrieval for purposes of *recalling* or *use as examples* becomes significantly easier. Think of it as you travelling down various rabbit holes in your mind.

Well, more details are on my blog post, but I hope this helps! I'd be happy to answer any questions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hs5f00/a_levels_a_tip_for_how_to_memorise_content_for/,True,2020-07-16 23:39:19
514,[University] How to get rid of introversion,"Last week I was speaking to my friend about university stuff and he said ""You're so quiet, what would u know about socialising and making connections for ur future in university?"" I laughed it off, but as much as I want to deny it, it's definitely true.

I'm all about self improvement, tried watching videos on how to break the ice, socialise etc and even forced myself to step out of my comfort zone by joining student council where in my school is notorious for having mostly extroverts. I made public speeches, forced myself to talk in front of large groups of people... But somehow instead of making myself more extroverted and comfortable with this kinds of situation, the opposite happened.

I really felt like I was pretending to be someone else, and I honestly never felt comfortable in all of my time in sc, always counting the time till meetings end where I can go home. Slowly after a few months, I became back to my reserved self again.

So I really just want to know, is there any way of permanently getting rid of this awkwardness and shyness that I have and just talk to people to network? I really want to learn how to be more extroverted before uni to make connections for my future.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fc3bdb/university_how_to_get_rid_of_introversion/,True,2020-03-02 16:10:47
515,[JC] Extroverted Problems,"whEw this is going to be a bit confusing but i've always been the extrovert among my friend group of introverts. during our JC orientation i managed to make friends with a bunch of extroverts and i pulled them all into this chaotic circle together and now i regret it. all of a sudden my ability to laugh decreases and my ability to relate to them disappeared. i no longer feel like talking as no one even bothers to listen, there will always be someone talking about a topic that i can't relate to :[ . we'll be receiving our home classes soon and i hope i can adopt any introverts   or chill people that like lofi music or sumn 😭 

noW the problem here is that since i created this chaotic group of extroverts, everytime i try to break away to make new quieter friends, their loudness scares them off like dogs to a group of birds. they always pull me into convos so i cant break free either :[ 

so my question here is; posted to the chill and introverted : how do i make friends with you without my other friends scaring you 🥺",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f26ly7/jc_extroverted_problems/,True,2020-02-12 02:35:42
516,[JC] RE: Proportion of different races in different schools,"This is a response to an earlier enquiry in a post with the same title. For those who have never read the first post, it was basically asking about the racial demographics in JC, and why the Malay student population is abysmally low for some schools, and really just low in general. As a Malay JC student, I will try to give more insight on why I personally think that the Malay student population is low in some JCs and low compared to Polys/ITEs. I would like to preface this by saying that I do not think that going to Poly or ITE is a worse option as compared to JC, but I will note the noticeable social stigma against these students, despite the changes in the educational system over the many years to improve such institutions.

Firstly, I would like to address why the Malay student population in some JCs is noticeably lower than others, despite perhaps having the same entry requirements. The main factor in my opinion is this: the current racial proportion in the school. If a school is already having little or no Malay students, it would already prove to be unattractive to Malays, regardless of their ability to enter the school. There is a certain comfort that you get when you are able to interact with people of your race, especially if you are a minority, as you are able to relate your personal experiences with them on a different level. 

With regards to the ability of Malay students to enter top-tier JCs, I'm not aware of any statistics of the specific O level scores of different racial groups, so I'm not able to comment on that with enough evidence. Though, I will note the general perception or stereotype that Malay students are less likely to study hard or do well (and perhaps it really gets into our heads sometimes when we are trying our best but still not able to pass haha). I would say a factor that worsens this is the value that a lot of Malays are taught, which is the concept of ""Redha"" or ""accepting your fate as it is"". Although I think that this concept can be beautiful when it is applied to certain life situations, I don't think it is especially useful when dealing with multiple failures in school, and it is definitely not contributing to a growth mindset. 

Other than the racial demographic in different JCs, it is also important to note the disparity in the number of Malay students in JCs and the number in Polys/ITEs. I would say that a certain number of factors contribute to this. One, getting a Poly diploma or Nitec is more practical than an A level cert. Besides, there is a lot of risk involved if you fail your A's, and the stress levels are really, really unattractive. This is further emphasised by the fact that it is ingrained in some Malays to get an immediately useful certificate to work as soon as possible, in order to support their families. These factors ultimately undermine JC - and higher education - as a viable option for some Malays, who would otherwise be able to get into top JCs.

Another cultural or religious factor I would say is that some Malay girls who are otherwise able to enter top JCs may be deterred by the fact that JCs have a uniform. As some Malay girls are expected by their parents (or by their own individual choice) to don the hijab when going to school, especially at the mature age of 17-18, they may see JC as a less attractive option. 

Ultimately, I would say that there is no driving factor that would lead to a shift in this trend, given that the quality of education in vocational institutes is arguably proving to be of similar quality, if not higher, than that of JCs. I would like to emphasise that this is my opinion and how I see this issue and not the definite truth. If you really want to know the truth or the reasons behind certain trends, I would recommend talking to the people in the community, and see their take on it. Hope I gave some insight :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j3tcsp/jc_re_proportion_of_different_races_in_different/,True,2020-10-03 04:13:49
517,[Uni] Rejected from medicine;conflicted on what to do next,"Hello! I created a reddit account just to ask this, shows how pretty desperate i am for advice :(

I am seriously feeling so lost ever since i got rejected by nus med. I am a 90rper, applied for both LKC and YLL. For LKC i was not shortlisted for interview while YLL got rejected after interview. My passion lies in being a doctor for as long as i can remember and i never considered any other career options. But, only closer to my application did i find out i may not be suited to be a doctor even if I wanted to be one, especially in the area of empathy. Don't get me wrong; i do care for others, but its more difficult for me to express it and i know empathy is a crucial skill they look for in potential doctors (most likely why i failed the interview). The emphasise people ive talked to (interviewers, current medical students) placed on the importance of having soft skills to be a doctor has actually made me rethink whether I can really be a doctor, as I definitely lack in those areas. So now im not sure whether i am suited to be a doctor and whether i should still aim for medical school. Its funny how ive aimed to be a doctor my whole life and yet know so little about actually being one. And since ive never ever thought about another career, im utterly lost. The only thing im certain of is that i love biology but idk what other career in biology i would want. Now i am considering a few options:

\-take nus life sci and (maybe) try for duke-nus

maybe ill be able to find other careers in biology i like? but uncertain. i also have a pretty low chance of getting accepted into duke considering how competitive it is. also dk whether i should continue to aim for med sch.

\-take nus pharmacy and (maybe) try for duke-nus

Im pretty conflicted whether if i want to try for duke nus should i go with a life sci or pharmacy degree. Im leaning more towards life sci since its more general and so maybe more career options for me to find one im interested in? Considering pharmacy because its healthcare and biology related as well, but not sure whether i would like the job. Small scope as well, so more difficult to switch fields if i dont like it?

\-take a gap year then try reapplying to LKC and YLL, also try applying to malaysia med schs (but not interested in other overseas countries)

can take on more opportunities like job shadowing, internships, volunteering and have time to learn new hobbies. but i really dont think ill be very motivated mentally to take a gap year as it would feel like im alone on this path while everyone else is moving on to uni already. not sure whether i should risk wasting a year if i still get rejected from med schs and also because im not sure whether i should still pursue medicine anymore as mentioned above.

i know that im pretty indecisive and probably overthinking too much but i know my choice will affect my future greatly and i dont want to end up w a job i am unhappy with for the rest of my life. any advice would be greatly appreciated :')

Edit: Motivation for being a doctor would be that i rlly enjoy learning about the human body and i find it rlly meaningful to be able to apply my knowledge to help others. Also because it has variety in the job scope? Like every patient is a different case which makes it rlly interesting to me. I would prefer a job that has variety and not those with very standard tasks to perform over and over again. Any job suggestions that you think will fit what im looking for would help too!

518,[UNI] Rejections,"Hi guys, I would like to share my two cents worth on something that many of us are going through right now - Rejection.

Just some context - I applied for my dream course (something that I've wanted to do for so long & was  pinning all my hopes and expectations on) but unfortunately got rejected. The cycle below explains very clearly and accurately what went through my head as I faced my reality

&#x200B;

[5 stages of grief \/ rejection](https://preview.redd.it/02qsxen76xy41.png?width=400&format=png&auto=webp&s=5986c24e08076cbb2c5f0545066bfdd3cdad0f2c)

Denial - Constantly refreshing my UAS portal, wanting to email NUSAdmissions to see if they keyed my results wrongly

Anger - Frustrated with the results that I was given, angry with the interviewing system & how we only get one shot at our dreams

Depression - Felt really sad and helpless that I had to choose something else, that I might have to give up my dream (even lost my appetite thinking of which course I should appeal to)

Bargaining - Here comes the 'what ifs' - What if I did better during the interview, what if I obtained higher grades...

Acceptance - A stage I am striving for, not sure if I have already reached, but definitely moving towards acceptance

I am writing this to those out there who are equally as lost as I am. Unsure if we should continue working towards our unattainable (at least for now) dream or to settle for what life offers us. Some of us are rejected from the course of your dream, some from the university of your dream, and some are rejected from all the universities. We are all facing different kinds of rejection, but I'm sure we share the same sentiment over rejection - feeling as if hope has been robbed away from our lives.

Here, I want to say that regardless of what kind of rejection you are facing, let's first appreciate ourselves for even reaching this stage. For fighting against the rigors of tertiary education, for chasing our dreams regardless of whether we emerge victorious or not.

Still, no words can describe how lost & unsure I am right now, and I am sure many of us face this same question. Should I continue to fight on for my dreams, or should I settle for what life offers?

Should I submit to my realities and possibly regret 5 years down the road? Should I take the risks and continue chasing what I truly desire? But how can I ever be certain that the future me still desires what the impulsive and indecisive 19 year old me desires.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gk7xby/uni_rejections/,True,2020-05-16 04:09:07
519,[META] PSLE Math Rant,"I posted this like a month ago but it got removed but I checked and it was still on so I was like whaaat. Anyway...

No, I am not taking PSLE this year, but something far worse. My cousins do and they always ask me for help mostly in Math. This has probably been reiterated many times. But I just wanted to rant about something I feel needs to be addressed in the primary school education system. In this particular case, it's for PSLE Math. I don't know why but it's just too difficult to solve those damn questions, especially without the use of simultaneous equations. For me, that is the challenge, doing questions with those god damn models and explaining it clearly to my cousins. 

It's time-consuming for me to think about the questions, and I presume it's worse for them. I remember my upper primary days being stressful and thinking I was stupid for not being able to answer those questions. I remember my parents paying for tuition that tried to teach me simultaneous equations, but I didn't know how to apply. See, I feel like if simultaneous equations were taught earlier then those kids will be less stressed out and have more fun in school.

I've seen people in JC getting 210 for PSLE and even some Normal Acad students excelling in H2 Math and even taking F Math. All I'm trying to say is that PSLE is one of the worst exams ever and I hope the syllabus changes to be a bit more advanced because algebra makes everything super easy. And as seen in secondary school, all algebra takes is a lot of practice to master, and not having to UNDERSTAND confusingly-worded questions and solving using MODELS. 

My hope for this rant is that more people, especially 12-year-olds and their parents, don't see PSLE as life defining because that shit is TOO hard and if they work hard and smart in secondary school everything will work out.

523,[JC] All about Millennia Institute,"hii I know I'm slightly late to the party but I just wanted to share about my experience in Millennia Institute (MI) for those still unsure about the school or just simply want to know more about us. I've been in your shoes before and I know the feelings of uncertainty, excitement and even despair, so I'll try my best to calm your fears and share everything I know to help you just that little bit if you're still considering MI as an option, whether as an alternative option to a JC or a polytechnic course :)

For those who don't know about MI, we are a centralised institute offering a 3-year A Level course instead of a conventional 2-year program that you see in JCs. We also offer a Commerce stream along with the Arts and Science streams, with us being the only A Level program offering Management of Business (MOB) and Principles of Accounting (PAA) as A-Level subjects :)) we use L1R4 to admit students, instead of L1R5 used by conventional JCs, as well as offer conditional admissions to those who were unable to pass their English and Mathematics at the O Levels.

Here's my self-introduction 👻 I'm currently a year 2 student in the commerce stream taking Management of Business, Math, Economics and Literature. I've been actively involved in school events and proceedings having been a class chairperson for my Year 1, and will be an OGL for this year's orientation 🥳 (if you get me as an OGL I promise I'm a nice person)

First up, why I chose MI. I have to say that I'm definitely part of that rare few that chose to come to MI even though I was eligible for other JCs as well as polytechnic courses, but I sure do have a reason for it !! the 3 year course was a major attraction for me even though it might seem super counterintuitive, especially for a male who still needs to serve his national service, but I have absolutely no regrets at all. The additional year might seem undesirable by many as they may feel like they are ""wasting a year"". However, I really think the additional year has been especially helpful for me as it really spreads the rigorous A Level syllabus out manageably for me to fully grasp concepts and all the content taught by the tutors. I've heard from my friends in the science stream that it has been ideal in helping them lay down their foundation for the intense science subjects, and those in the arts stream (aka sorta me) can fully understand each topic/chapter in depth before moving on, for example. The slower pace gives students like me more time to process everything being taught and not rush it just to meet syllabus deadlines :)

That's why here at MI, we have little to no pre-requisites for our subjects - even combined science students and those who did not take A-Math at the O Levels who want to take the respective subjects at the H2 level can do so with the respective bridging programs offered !! For those taking Arts subjects like Literature and Geography, there is also no requirement to have taken it at O Levels, and most people qualify to take the subject - for example, to take Literature at the H2 Level, you only had to score a B4 and above for your English at O Levels :) Together with the much slower and manageable pace to build up a foundation and unto it, a strong content tower is not too far from reach !!

Another reason why I chose MI was to take up one of the 2 exclusive subjects offered only by MI at the A Levels - in my case, Management of Business (MOB), with the other subject being Principles of Accounting (PAA). I've always had wanted to study business-related content and activities, having been interested in the social and corporate world since young, although not so much to consider it as a polytechnic or university course. Taking MOB as a subject helped me learnt so much about the business environment in the world right now, which has become extremely important even as society continues to grow, all without the commitment of a specific course at a polytechnic. And yes, it may be to your surprise, but I have friends who take business courses at university, and much of the content are actually rather similar albeit from a few concepts in which they take it much further than we do. That's a given for sure, but still, that goes to show that it's no slack in the subject, and it has certainly been an enjoyable one for me with dedicated teachers, carefully crafted syllabuses and teaching schedules. For those who are considering business courses in polytechnic, the MOB course here at MI is definitely a strong alternative, soo do take that into consideration :)

That brings me very nicely unto addressing the next big concern - our subject tutors. A major worry of many out there would be the opinion of MI tutors being ""too slack"" or ""disinterested and boring"". That is certainly a valid concern especially with A Levels having such a gigantic stake in our academic lives, however, from my personal unbiased experience, I can say for sure that **most** tutors in MI are dedicated and are willing to guide you along to make sure you don't fall behind.

The general consensus that I've heard going around is that MI is a school for ""JC rejects"" and ""A Level beggars"". I have to say that is mostly not true, and amidst all the negativity, there are actually a lot of positives coming out of our school haha. Like mentioned above, the lack of pre-requisites for many subjects and the extended 3-year program means that students are a lot more guided than they would be in a conventional JC, where independence is promoted immediately when one enters the school. The rigour of the A-Levels is certainly daunting, to say the least, but the teachers here are more inclined to guide students and navigate them unto the right path by focusing a lot on fundamentals and foundations before moving on.

That's not to say that it'll be as guided as in secondary school, but it will certainly be not too much of a contrasting difference to throw you straight into the deep end. Think of it as a toddler learning how to walk, first slowly with the guidance of a walker, then a parent, and finally on their own. As such, MI would be perfect for those who might need a little bit of push and support on the content side of subjects and establishing foundations, before taking the wheel by themselves as they gain confidence in the respective subjects. All of the tutors I've gotten last year in Year 1 have been extremely supportive of me, and have been constantly open for consultations, as well as being there to push and guide me along when I fall behind. My math tutor has been a particular highlight, consistently looking out for my classmates and I, and even asked me for a coffee chat once when he saw me looking rather troubled over one of my results on a test, where I performed way below expectations. He was also the person that established the love and interest of math back in me, and many other subject tutors have done the same too, reminding me time and time again why I enjoy the subject so so much. With their guidance and support, it has made my academic journey a lot more enjoyable and manageable, and with their fun personalities, have been awesome people to approach even for the simplest of advices.

As for the culture in our school, toxicity and the ability to make friends will actually be extremely subjective on who you really know and get as your classmates. Speaking from my personal experience, I've had made amazing friends and classmates even though I was the only one from my school that came into MI, and I'm sure it is the case for many other Millennians as well :)) there is definitely no guarantee or pre-established levels of ""toxicity"" for every school, and the MI community definitely isn't more toxic or anything like that, by measure. Again, toxicity is bound to occur everywhere - it is up to the individual to find the right company and friends, which I'm sure you'll be able to find here in MI :)

Lastly, for those still unsure about MI even after everything I've mentioned, I can't leave without talking about the strength of our holistic programmes in school !! We have frequent Education and Career Guidance (ECG) programmes for students to discover more about possible future professions, as well as many leadership experience programmes and opportunities for students to discover the passion to serve those around them :) some things more exclusive to us would be the [MI.World](https://MI.World) programme that take students around the globe to locations such as Germany, France, India, China, all but to name a few, to learn more about the ever-changing world around them and discover various cultures that they would not experience on a daily basis. The Amethyst Talent Programme (ATP) is also exclusive to us, where we offer students who perform well the opportunity to participate in scholarship talks, receive internship opportunities and many more :)

That has been one **long** writeup of my experience, but I'm glad I've managed to pen most of my thoughts down - well at least anything and everything that has come to my mind while writing this. My inbox is always open for anyone still wanting to clarify anything or still have any pre-existing questions or worries that have not been answered in this post, so don't be afraid to drop me a message :)) all the best in whatever you choose to do, and for those of you who have chosen MI as one of your choices, I hope to see you at Orientation ;) ✌🏻",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwifed/jc_all_about_millennia_institute/,True,2021-01-14 07:17:19
524,[N LEVELS] - Encouragement Post?,"Hello everyone 👋 

I’m sure that everyone by now has received their GCE N LEVEL results!; I would just like to say that each one of you did a great job so please don’t feel upset about your results! Let me just share what I’ve gone through - (Since it’s an anonymous post and no one really knows me here xoxo I guess I would just share about my life? Really do hope it encourages you or in any way make you feel a little better if you are reading this ❤️) 

I had a lot of family problems while I was growing up.  I won’t really go in depth of what had happened but I went through a hard time when I was in primary school. That has caused me to fail my PSLE in 2015. I retained that very year and felt like the shittest person on earth. I couldn’t care less about anything and just wanted to sleep my problems and pain away. It really was hard coming back to school when all you see is your friends progressing into secondary school without you. I felt so alone and no one could resonate with my feelings. 

It took me quite some time to get myself back up - to motivate, encourage myself that I can and will be able to go through this process once again. It was also due to the Teachers unwavering support that they have given me which motivated me to study even harder when I was in primary school. Though I didn’t do that well for PSLE in 2016 and ended up in the Normal Academic stream with a score of 155, I still am very thankful and blessed to have Teachers who were by my side when I felt like a failure. 
 
I worked even harder when I was in secondary school although things weren’t doing well back home:(: (ok long story short - till Sec 4) I’ve decided to really work REALLY HARD so I could do well. (Which I did ^^ and I am till this very day still grateful and thankful. I really appreciate the Teachers in my school for their indefatigable support)

I just want to say that Everyone will experience failures and setbacks in their lives. N levels REALLY isn’t the end.

525,[Junior College] Anxiety in JC- Advice,"hello guys. promos are in a few days and I haven't revised yet (yes ik im crazy). i've always been a very last minute person but somehow I managed to get into a ""elite"" jc idek how. but now im in a class filled with people way smarter than me and more all-rounded. i think about them and it completely destroys my mood i dont study at all now and its also ruined my social life bcos i feel like im inferior to them. people say that's the kind of environment we should thrive in but im really starting to give up way more easily and im underperforming by a lot. it is not good to compare with others but I really can't control myself and its really showing on my grades ( I take BCME failed everything and borderline passed bio). In the past, I used to get so disturbed when I got anything less than an A1 but nowadays I'm numbed to failing exams. I was in a similar situation the last time was in a class filled with people smarter/ more all-rounded than me and it really was a dark period for me and i don't want that to happen again. im getting anxious and afraid if i'll promote and I really don't want to be one of the kids who peaked at the wrong time and life went downhill after. **What should I do?**",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/itto23/junior_college_anxiety_in_jc_advice/,True,2020-09-17 03:31:55
526,[UNI] Burn out during first week of school,"I don’t know if this is unusual/ normal, but I was extremely taken aback by the heavy workload in uni. I’m taking law so of course this was rather expected, but I find myself being preoccupied with what to study/ revise next, which case to read next etc. It’s like a never ending cycle of worrying and feeling insufficient 24/7 that it has basically taken over my life and has left me no room to do/ think about anything else. 

I don’t know how to “study smart” and sieve through reading the important things and skimming through un-important things, and I feel extremely lost in class. Honestly I don’t think it’ll be sustainable to continue like this in the long run where I’m constantly anxious over feeling lost/ dumb. People in NUS are amazingly nice and I’m thankful for that. I just feel like other than the social aspect of uni, there’s really nothing much to look forward to, and I don’t know if I can continue living in dread and grinding this much everyday. There must be an easier way(?) My mental health is degrading and it’s making me a little worried. Does anyone (especially law students) have any advice on how I should stop being so anxious (perhaps a mindset to have?) and little things I could do to make my integration into uni better? Also, is it normal to feel lost during the 2nd week of school or am I just slow?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ifx45r/uni_burn_out_during_first_week_of_school/,True,2020-08-25 12:28:37
527,[Rant] Lost on what to do for uni,"Hallo this beaver has been feeling lost lately. 

I’ve recently graduated from an IT course in a poly. I did really well in my course. Hence, I did what made the most sense and applied for NUS information systems and NTU comp sci. I eventually settled on NUS information systems and accepted their offer. I even managed to snag a government scholarship for uni. ( haven’t accepted )

This seems well and all but the issue is I’m not sure if IT in general is my calling. Sure I don’t mind coding and I find a little satisfaction when I do it right. But I’m thinking of switching over to business/finance or other courses. 

No joke my childhood ambitions were to be an astronaut, fish farmer and taxi driver ( to steal ppl hand phones if they leave behind ). As you can see I was not exactly a bright child. At my age, I have not yet found what I love doing. I do still like the idea of maybe doing aquatic science but i don’t see it as a viable option here. 

Is a general business degree/ finance degree any good nowadays? I’m gravitating towards that right now tbh OR become a policeman since I’m enlisting in SPF lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hdldfz/rant_lost_on_what_to_do_for_uni/,True,2020-06-22 20:38:49

530,[Rant] Don't give up!!! (Let's spread encouragement to the people taking major exams),"Since I have to write a 500 word essay, might as well tell my story. Hi! I has a PSLE grade of 199(Express/NA), went to a neighbourhood school(ehem Strive serve and *beep*, not saying the full thing haha, according to some insta post, someone listed my school as one of the top ten worst schools, why the fuck would you do that???), got O level 11 pts (include cca pts) and has ELR2B2 btw 10 to 13 and went to a low tier JC(getting 78 for A Levels excludes MT) Took CCAs in JC plus a subject rep role in JC(aka collect money and order from bookshop notes and give to friends etc.). I feel like people from my school probably know me by now so ...Hi!

""Bro, why are you telling us your stupid background story? No one fucking cares""

In my JC and Sec school, despite differences (like how majority of student would rather go poly than JC), they have a common culture among most students(not all) : Many people would not study hard because they don't believe that they do not have the resources or the ability to be smart. 

I just want to let you know that even if you are from the ""worst school"" among the rest, it does not define how well you will do in A/O/N level or PSLE or Poly or ITE. Don't let your past define you, only your current actions can decide how you want to dedicate your time in your studies. Don't believe me, here's the reddit post of YJC/IJC students mostly talking about how well they did their life: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fzww0o/jc_redditors_who_graduated_from_yjcijc_how_well/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=&utm_content=comments_view_all

And it goes to show one thing. If you want to achieve something, start now and don't give up. Seek help and advice from seniors. Different people start from different backgrounds and level of ability. Some can overachievers while others may struggle. Improvement takes time, never give up.

And people who alr completed Uni/A levels/Poly/ITE/O levels and N Levels as private, retakers or school candidates, if you have anything motivational to say to the the people taking these exams now, pls do contribute by commenting in the reddit section, feel like during this CB period, we need to show more support for those taking major exams.

P.S. I did not have tuition during secondary school or JC either but I had tuition during P3 to P6 cus I sucked at Math and Languages. Wanted to show that having tuition or not does not determine what you will get in the end. And to those who say ""80 rp and below or L1R5 of 13 and above is horrible"", I can tell you that it is my opinion and also my school's cohort opinion, so there are people who agree with me, and I respect your opinion as well, cus it is your goal.

P.s. I did not count the number of words I have on this post also sorry 😅",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/grmuqs/rant_dont_give_up_lets_spread_encouragement_to/,True,2020-05-28 08:25:06

533,[Poly] Frustrated at how things are,"hello, wrote this post to say how frustrated I am with things happening in poly. I learn from my past experience that i should clarify and asked around whenever I have doubts.. and I did and people aren’t willing to help and you can see from the tone of the message that people aren’t willing to help.

Idk why but I feel frustrated at how things are, first of all I have a toxic classmate and I don’t have much people to turn to when I need help. And sometimes when I asked to just clarify something really minor people felt that it is something common sense to them/like why I am clarifying about it. 

like it’s like I just want to clarify my doubts and then not stereotyping that all elites students are like that, but some of them just like think highly of themselves and they think perhaps they understand the stuff and everyone should be have the same level of understanding.. 

I’m just so frustrated, so in the end I just suffer in silence.. then lecturers also aren’t really helpful.

sometimes I wish I could be at the same level, so like at least I have the knowledge and I won’t have to suffer in silence since some people are so selfish these days.

Update: appreciate the comment you all have put under the post, yes i know there is google and all but for the stuff I learnt is kind of difficult to get research online and yes I did asked my lecturers but we are restricted from asking some stuff too. that’s why I felt frustrated at the situation.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k92iai/poly_frustrated_at_how_things_are/,True,2020-12-09 03:18:59

my sleep cycle is fked. i studied yesterday overnight and i just woke up. due to external factors (not even abt my past papers anymore lol), ive been crying since i got home yesterday. its 7pm and the day is gone yet i havent started on my studies. im still crying rn. 

i just want to die. i cant find motivation to study. all im doing is crying like a weakling i am. i cant freaking think straight anymore. sigh. 

update : im someone who hates fakes. like hate hate. i mingled really well in j1 but after i found them fake i cut them all off. i didnt mind being alone and a “loner” because i rather have real friends than superficial ones. i absolutely did not care if i looked like a loser or not cause im not insecure abt eating alone or what not. but here on reddit i find myself creating friendships with so many beautiful and encouraging people. yall have no business to be encouraging. yall dont even know me. but the fact that you guys come forth and text me, dm me, drop me words of encouragement. you guys have such a pure heart. im someone who is able to weed out toxic ppl from my life pretty easily tbh. i know you guys are the real ones out there because i have NO RELATIONSHIP with any of you yet you guys uplift me. thank you. ❤️",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jq9yc2/a_levels_no_motivation/,True,2020-11-09 03:00:56
536,[O Levels] Screwed for O levels,"I take 9 subjects( Eng, E and A Math, triple sci, SS+Hist, pure geog, and hcl.)

However, I have not started studying at all and I feel very screwed as O levels are in 7days  time.  I feel so lazy and unmotivated to revise. I don't even know how I am supposed to revise. I only know some of my content but idk whether I shud be doing more tys/prelim papers or actually revise content since I am severely lacking time. Should I be giving up some of my subjects since I have extra and most likely would have no time to finish my revision? I'm really lost...

&#x200B;

For subjects I plan to use, I probably need help in bio, geog and physics. Any tips for these subjects since both bio and geog are content-heavy, further worsened by the fact that hist and bio are on the same day. Also for geog, where can I  find case studies since the textbook provides very less and brief examples.and can I make them up if necessary? For physics, I have the content knowledge most of the time, however, I am not able to phrase my answers properly, missing out a lot of keywords and phrases. 

I really don't know what I'm doing with life right now. All I can say is I am very unmotivated and  really don't have the willpower to pick up a book to kick start my revision.

538,[Jobs] What to expect on 1st Day at Mcdonalds?,"So... I finally got a job at Mcdonalds. I am actually super worried now because this is my first time working, so I gotta bunch of questions.

1) What do we need to bring for first day? (I took down the stuff, but idk if i got all of it. ) (Black shoes and pants, bank details, passport photo, anything else?

2) Do we have a locker of some sorts to put our things in?

3) How do they train you on the first day? Do you serve customers on your first day?

4) How exactly... do you do the jobs of a cashier? Like I saw a lot of boxes, but what do they represent and all? 

5) Is mcdonalds gonna be a job I can sustain throughtout jc? (Im trying to save up for uni)

6) What bank details are you supposed to give? (Do I have to just give my bank number, or do I have to show proof of account and stuff like that?)

Thanks yall, just a super nervous person here.

Edit: Just finished 4 days at mcdonalds, heres my exp

They needed a scan of my nric, bank details(must be mine or shared) and passport photo. I wore full black on the first day, then on the 2nd day they gave me new attire and cap. It was overall quite fun, and I did enjoy work although it was tiring. All the other staff helped me out a lot and it was pretty much a very chill atmosphere.

Here is some fun stats:
Most fave job: Making frappé 😆
Least fave job: Making fries (It gets REALLY hot, trust me)

3 people said ""you too"" in a 7 hour shift when I told them ""have a nice meal"" (it was so. Cute.)

Tbh, not a lot of people said thank you, so those who did made me really happy, especially those who meant it. 

The salad is rly underrated at mcdonalds. Idk how much it is, but it smells soo good. In a 7 hour shift, only 3 people bought it (*sad salad noises*)

Its very shocking to see that not many people use the mcdonalds app discounts. If you havent done so, chk it out. You can get free stuff.

But works tiring lol. Idk if I can mamage through jc. I just need to save up pocket money since i wont be gg to ns.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kiqbqx/jobs_what_to_expect_on_1st_day_at_mcdonalds/,True,2020-12-24 01:54:04

541,[O Levels] My thoughts on Additional Mathematics Paper 2,"Not gonna lie, todays paper 2 was perhaps the hardest paper I have done. Harder than all the piles of prelim papers I did, 100x harder than the past year O Levels. I really do not get what Cambridge was thinking when they were settinf today's paper. I heard about our batch being the last batch having this syllabus, maybe Cambridge wanted to spam the hardest questions in our years? Moreover, I was really surprised to see so many explain questions. Yes, they were frustrating. Really frustrating. The questions this year needed a lot of brain power, like the reverse integration question, and the dt/dx question (which was really weird imo because our school teachers actually talked about how it is not applicable, and it was my first time doing dt/dx); a lot of imagination (the parallelogram question which I only managed to figure out how to solve it in the last 2 minutes and couldn't finish); and a good sense of time management (i.e paper one).

Maybe, it could also have been that SEAB wants to raise the standards of our papers or simply wants to train our creativity. For instance, many (include me) feel that Amath is too dead in the way we answer, and there is simply no creativity to it.

Nonetheless, it was an extremely mentally painful 2 hr and 30 mins for me and OOOMAIGUAD I was traumatised. I feel every single one of you guys complaining in the megathread. But it's alright guys, because this year's bell curve is definitely less steep than any other years.

542,[Meta] Suggestion: laptop megathread,"@ mods, can we have a megathread for all the laptop questions please? Or move all the laptop posts to the daily thread?

Every year it is the same this time of the year when the poly and uni freshmen look to get their devices, but this year seems to be worse perhaps because of the covid. So I thought it might be good to have a megathread or something for laptop questions. This is for two reasons, first, reduce laptop clutter in the sub, and second, make it easier for people to read through all the laptop posts, including past year’s posts.

For the first reason, there’s just way too many posts on laptops and iPads in my opinion and a lot of them have been answered before with the same points. Every single day I see so many threads about iPads and laptops and most of the questions are the same in nature - for example, whether iPad will suffice over a laptop, or what specs should I get for X course, or is Macbook suitable for Y course vs Windows.

For the second reason, being able to read through other people’s laptop questions and answers from seniors can also help those who are totally lost to know more about the piece of metal they’re about to spend thousands of dollars on. They can get points of consideration they never thought of before and for those large course like business, can also see what their fellow freshmen are getting or considering.

Judging from the upvotes on the laptop posts I’m guessing lots of people having the same questions about what to buy, so that’s why, in my opinion, having a megathread will be helpful in consolidating and making it easier for people to find what they need.

544,[A Levels] How to do well for PW - from a senior,"Hi guys I'm back, and today I want to give some PW advice to the J1s! It's been 2 years already, but I'll try to recall my experience as much as possible and give you guys some tips! As usual, this is not a foolproof guide to scoring A for PW, so take my words with a pinch of salt!

First, CREATE RAPPORT with your groupmates. For me, I was pretty lucky to have a few outgoing groupmates, since I am quite shy and reserved myself, so my groupmates helped to ""set the tone"" for the next few months together. I can't stress how important it is to have an amicable working relationship with your groupmates. When you guys have 1 disagreement, please please please settle it ASAP and don't sweep it under the rug. Cause when more disagreements arise, there will surely be beef eventually. Let me tell you, other groups will love listening to your group beef. And when other groups know about it, you will rant even more to them and become even more unhappy, when you could have solved the problem when it first arised! One way to build a good working relationship if you guys don't already have one, is to have lunch or dinner outside together. Try not to discuss about PW during lunch/dinner, but talk about other things. Learn more about each other and their personalities. That will help you greatly in the future. This helps yall bond, and when you guys are bonded and there are disagreements in the future, yall will automatically solve it amicably. 

Next, LISTEN TO YOUR PW TUTOR! At first, my tutor kept nitpicking at my group's ideas and we had to keep changing our topic. I think my group can't think of good ideas so eventually our tutor helped us with the brainstorming process as well. My tutor was so nitpicky and his comments were sometimes harsh, my group eventually became quite demoralised and it reached the point where whenever our tutor called our group, we would be like ""oh no now what"". But guess what! My whole class got A for PW and I highly believe it's because of our PW tutor. So whenever your tutor comments on your ideas, keep an open mind. Don't complain. Think about it this way: ""If my tutor did not tell us about this problem, maybe we will get B for PW"". Tutors want you to get A. That's why they can be quite naggy sometimes. Instead, be grateful to your tutor for taking the time to slowly look at your reports and find all the mistakes. Then when your tutor finally praises you, I tell you yall will feel damn good inside. 

Next, DO THE WORK IF YOU HAVE TO. For sure there will be slackers. And some of them will never change. But this concerns your final A-Level grade. So don't take the chance. If they don't change, don't waste time ranting about them to other people. Instead, do the quality work yourself. I know some people will disagree with me on this, and alot of people will ask you to tell your tutor. Yes, tell your tutor if you have to. But sometimes it still doesn't work. So tank the project if you have to. As I said in my previous post on how to do well for As, I believe in Karma. We all get what we deserve according to how much effort we put in at the end of the day. 

Lastly, ok this one is not really a tip though... So i'm sure 99.9% of you guys are thinking about how useless PW is. That was me I felt that PW was the most useless thing ever. But right, to be honest, I lowkey feel that actually PW was quite useful hahaha. The skills you get from PW are actually damn valuable. In fact, I'm actually using my OP skills I learnt from PW for my Uni and scholarship interviews now.

545,[JC] Stressed over jc life,"Hi. So I'm J1 this year and I'm really stressed and miserable  in JC right now. This is because of how rigorous the timetable is, such as the earliest school day ending at around 4, and the subjects are extremely content heavy and demanding. I've spent the past two weeks of school just waking up early everyday and studying at school, and then going to lessons to listen and then when I get home I revise and study even more. I think it's because I'm terrified of messing up common tests, and I keep obsessing over promos. 

It doesn't help that the teachers just keep giving out homework and don't really bother seeing if it is sensible to give such a heavy load, for example, they tell you to watch ten videos by a few days, and they're around 20 minutes and if you don't watch them, you won't know what is going on during lessons. That's fine, until more teachers keep adding to the workpile. 

I'm starting to think that I really don't want to do this anymore, spending my next two years like a machine, only alive so I can study even more. 
I'm more stressed than I was for the Os, now I sleep really late and wake up really early because there's not enough time, and I'm just unhappy in jc. I feel like I'm doing worse than I've ever been. I have no appetite to eat food anymore because I'm so worried about how to manage, and everyday I wake up feeling like there is no reason to go to school because the subjects I'm learning don't seem to be interesting to me anymore, when I know that I will have to take exams for them and they will determine my future.

I don't know what to do and my parents don't seem to understand my struggles. They keep telling me that there's the weekend and school holidays to enjoy but don't we have to spend that revising for our tests? Why are they so clueless? They believe that I just need to bear with it for two years so I can get an A level cert, but honestly I'm so exhausted I don't want to do anything anymore, because using up any more energy will just burn me out further. I've already broke down so many times because of the stress from JC but they don't seem to care. Please give me some advice on what I can do",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fcs8zm/jc_stressed_over_jc_life/,True,2020-03-04 01:39:32

551,[A Levels] The Importance of a Study Plan,"J3 here :) Just wanted to share a bit of advice! Whenever my juniors ask me how I studied for my A Levels, I often forget to mention how much a detailed study plan helped me. Especially at this time of the year for J2s, it's very important to not just know *how* to study, but also *what* to study. 

# Why you need a study plan

1. It helps to keep you motivated. A Levels can seem daunting, like a level 100 final boss in an MMORPG. Once you break it down into small, achievable goals, it doesn't feel as intimidating anymore (it's like progressing through the story quests to level up until you are at a level high enough to defeat the final boss)
2. It helps you decide *what* to study. To do well in exams, there are always two components: content and skills. A study plan helps you to decide how to work on them simultaneously. Furthermore, your study plan should be dynamic and account for your current performance: if you are scoring As for every subject except GP, clearly you should focus more on GP.

# What to consider

1. Are you clear of the content being taught? If so, please move on to practising your exam skills! For example, after my MYEs, I was almost exclusively practising writing Econs essays under timed conditions to make better arguments and evaluations, and doing GP essays on 'broad' topics that do not really require that much niche knowledge to practice my argumentation skills. For subjects like Math and Physics, it could be as simple as doing questions under timed conditions. 
2. What are your exam results showing? Dedicate more time to your weaker subjects. Within a subject, dedicate more time to your weaker chapters / skills.
3. Do you have other goals? For me, I had to do my US uni applications. Don't forget to dedicate time to those too, because if you don't start early, you will almost definitely regret it later on when you are rushing to meet the deadlines.'
4. Major milestones. Leading up to Prelims, how prepared do you want to be? Perhaps you want to cover all the content by the halfway mark and do practice papers for the other half. Perhaps you are already proficient in your content and want to start doing practice papers immediately to identify your weak points. It will be good to treat Prelims as a practice round against the level 100 boss because it kinda is. By prelims, I wanted to know that if I took the A-Levels immediately after, I would be able to do well. (for some subjects like Computing, the A-Level practical **was** actually immediately after Prelims)
5. Don't forget to stop and smell the roses. JC can be hectic, but that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyable! Believe it or not, being in NS now, I think J2 was the most enjoyable time of my life. Don't neglect your social life and put some time aside to have fun, especially after major exams. I remember I went to watch Joker right before A Levels started because I was feeling too stressed to continue studying productively (I also re-watched Infinity War the morning of my H3 exam in May!). There is a limit to how productive you can be if you just keep studying non-stop. Take some time to relax, and it *will* help in the long-run. You will be far more productive if you take breaks in between your study sessions.
6. Stick to it. Studying at home may suck, but what I did was that I literally locked my phone in another room and drowned myself in notes and practice papers until I was tired. Then i take short 10-minute breaks watching YouTube :)

# All the best!

552,[A Levels] How to score for chem,"Suddenly thought of this because I saw an Alevel post on my feed lol. Context: Am senior who scored DESU (mostly s/u) for chem all the way until prelims B, Alevels A. Hated chem. This is how I achieved the big jump in grades:

For organic chem, how I went from not understanding anything at all to being pretty confident was DOING TOPICAL DRILL PRACTICES. At first I tried to memorise all the reactions by flipping textbook again n again, trust me doesnt work. What u can do is: Flip textbook a few times, make ur notes if u want, but after that, go buy some TOPICAL drill practice OChem assessment book (or ask frm ur teacher) and just do all of the questions for each topic. (make sure the assessment book has answers btw) (also make sure each topical practice has a lot alot alot of questions like 50 questions if not this method might not work if u have bad memory like me)

For the first few questions, its ok if u dk how to do, just refer to the answer and make a mental note in ur mind relating the question to the answer. As u keep doing repetitive questions, you will naturally memorise the reaction. This is how u build a foundation of knowing all the reactions/characteristics etc. Also MAKE SURE ur assessment book questions are really the very very basic memorisation without critical thinking kind because if ur like me u would be starting from next to zero knowledge when doing each topical practice, the point is to build up ur memory of reactions not to test ur critical thinking. Also consult ur chers if needed!

Btw the above is for OCHEM ONLY. For physical chem, u really need to read textbook and UNDERSTAND what is going on, not just memorise the answer structure n anyhow plug in values for different questions. After understanding, u can go ahead and do practice questions too (although I would say for phys chem doing alottt of basic drill practices is not that important, just UNDERSTAND concepts and do tutorials.) 

And ofc do TYS also! Trust me please guys because I really sucked at chem and this method worked really well. Jiayou for A Levels!

Edit: Also if your schools’ lecture notes are super wordy and have unnecessary info like mine, just learn the stuff listed in the learning objectives! Don’t be like me and ignore it and end up memorising unnecessary shit (in J1 before i discovered it existed)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fqa1lc/a_levels_how_to_score_for_chem/,True,2020-03-28 16:56:35

554,[JC] TJC experience (replying to someone’s thread),"[TJC RANT]
(this is to reply to someone’s thread asking about experience in tjc)
im a science student from tjc but do take note this is from my personal experience so may not be the same for everyone olevel students pls don’t take this as a reference!!!!

i have heard from my friends in other jc that some will be competitive till the point where they steal each other’s notes but as far as i know in tjc it’s not as competitive as that :)

For the environment i think tjc is going to upgrade their campus in 2022 and students will be moving to tampines jc campus so that’s smt u shld consider about since u will be affected by it!

A lot of ppl talked about tjc having pests but honestly i only saw like 2 or 3 mosquitoes before so not that big of a problem for me :) 

ok now i want to rant about how strict and stubborn tjc is about their attire and attendance!!!! lol u may hear from ur seniors that jc start their school late and tchers being quite lenient if ure late for school or if u are not wearing proper attire (eg: continue wearing pe shorts for the rest of day aft pe) in tjc sorry no we start sch at 7:30am for most of the days, if u are late they will make u stand infront of the whole sch in a row which they call the “walk of shame”, some don’t want to be embarrassed so they try loitering at the hawker centre opp sch but tjc damn smart they will station tchers there to chase u back to school, if u are late more than two times u will be send to detention and also don’t try to pon school lol ur civic tutor won’t accept parent’s letter only mc so ya detention off u go (or maybe i just got unlucky and got a strict tutor) 
They are very strict about attire checks too SIGH only one earhole is allowed they will make u take off the others if u have more than 1 pair and they have some formal day that makes u wear tie and in full uniform until afternoon :”)

Since the person also used the word “personally” frankly speaking i didn’t really enjoyed my time there, maybe bcos im not the smart smart mugger type i couldn’t understand a single thing the tutors said in lectures :( the tutors i had were terrible (like ALL of them i took pcme btw) i think it was just my luck (ya im scared later tjc ppl come after me) My teachers were so dead and monotone during tutorials and didn’t really bother to really go a step further to help those lagging behind, they are going at a pace more catered to the ip students, thus many of my jae friends in my class are unable to cope :( tbh their econs and math notes are terrible (long winded and repetitive not rlly to the point) compared to other jcs (again just personal opinion altho few of my ip friends agreed) my gp teacher was really biased towards the smarter kids too, think she have some sort of anger management issue lol 🙄
the person asked about the arts stream but i don’t take arts so can’t say too much but my friends in arts enjoyed their time there so it should be fine 

Ok i sound like i hate tjc so much which is true (btw i wasn’t bullied nor dumped nor expelled nor a troublemaker in class i did made quite a lot of friends there) there are still great things there such as the fun and variety of events they conduct which indeed made my j1 experience quite a fulfilling one. Some ppl said that there are ip and jae segregation but as long as u don’t mix with those high ses ppl it’s fine!

Overall i would not recommend ppl that are not naturally smart type to go to tjc or any ip jc 😔bcos since ur pace will be v diff from theirs and it’s up to the student to catch up and get used to their style as teachers need to concentrate more on finishing the syllabus......... annnnnd in case anyone thinks that i shouldnt be complaining since i put tjc as one of my choices well it wasn’t in any of my top choices so nvr planned to end up in tjc!!!!!!

555,"[o levels] a ""success story""!","hello! for context, im a J2 who is taking her As this year.

so.. i've been frequenting the sgexams subreddit pretty much since the start of As and have come across a number of posts from you o level kiddos abt not having the motivation to study (unfortunately i still relate)/ getting warped in negative thoughts/ struggling w self-doubt/ wanting to hear sum success stories yada yada i think you get the gist of what im saying. i figured i should share my ""success story"" in hopes of motivating sum of you o level peeps out there who are unsure if you'll be able to make a significant difference in your results in such a short period of time.

with O's alr in full swing, it's easy to feel de-motivated as there's a huge pressure to prove that you're working your ass off every second of every day and if you're not, you aren't ""deserving"" of good grades (smth that has been directed at me multiple times). false.

now, first of all, you reap what you sow. if you put in effort you WILL see the results. vice-versa.

second of all, confidence is key! over-confidence is nvr a good thing, but neither is under-confidence. don't plague yourself w so much doubt that you start to second guess what you alr know. you have been in secondary school for 4/5 years, you have amassed knowledge over 4/5 years, you have been preparing for Os for 4/5 years. believe it or not, you're ready!

ok onto my lil life story hahaha 

for prelims i didn't do well. my l1r5 was 33 which meant i was most def not eligible for jc. my l1r4 (sorry i can't rmb the exact number) did not allow for poly either. why did i perform so poorly for prelims? a combination of a dire lack of motivation to study + complacency. my prelim results truly shocked me to the core as i had been dreaming of entering jc since the first day of sec 1. i was completely shattered. these feelings, a mixture of hopelessness and despair, continued till the day before my first written paper. then they were overcome by pure unadulterated fear. ""tmrw is my first O level paper and i know shit"" i studied the entire day and the fear of being completely unknowledgeable during the exam fueled as motivation for the next week or so. however, i eventually fell back into a rut. i was completely unproductive for a few days (right in the middle of Os) when it hit me that ""i have to do this (Os) for myself. for no one other than me. if im not gonna do smth for myself, who is? this (getting into jc) is smth that i've been yearning for since the first day of sec 1 and this is my only chance."" i managed to resume the grind (albeit a rather slow one) and eventually managed a l1r5 of 11 for Os. 1/3 of my l1r5 for prelims, an improvement of almost 22 ""points"".

the day that i received my results i was shit scared. in fact, i was contemplating not even showing up to school and instead collecting my results from the GO later. but im so glad that i went to school to collect my results. i ended up crying literally 5 times (all happy tears!) as i was extremely elated w my results.

moral of my rather long post is: you can do it. you have the power to effect changes into your life (by obtaining the O level grades that you desire). make full use of it.

tldr: i went from a l1r5 of 33 for prelims to a l1r5 of 11 for Os. you can do it too!

(im not tryna brag. im simply sharing my story in hopes of motivating at least one person. while sitting for my Os i was in search of success stories as i was absolutely desperate for motivation; however, i nvr managed to find one that truly resonated w me and hence i was petrified. ""if no one has been in a similar position as me, how can i do it?"" there are plenty of stories out there of ppl who've made btr improvements than me as well as ppl who've scored btr than me for Os but one similarity among all these is that they started working hard after prelims, or at the very least much earlier than me. i only started truly studying at the very last min and as such i found that i couldn't relate to them. so if there's anybody out there that's in a similar situation as i was, you can do it!!!)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jhdnpm/o_levels_a_success_story/,True,2020-10-25 10:12:33

558,[POLY] MY JOURNEY THROUGH NA > ITE > POLY & TIPS,"Hi guys! Don’t really know if this will be helpful to anyone but i just wanted to share my journey and some tips that may help whoever find this helpful!

**\*disclaimer**, i’m listing things that have helped me and have found it helpful throughout this journey especially it’s such an unconventional route. so to whoever needs this, feel free to read on and AMA!

some background info: I’m actually a Normal Acad student (12 point) who decided to pursue a route to ITE through the direct poly programme offered by ITE (2 years of higher nitec and if you manage to obtain a cgpa of 3, you will sort of be guaranteed a spot in your mapped course/course related to your higher nitec course)

**ITE:**

As a direct poly programme(DPP) student, you are required to start school a few months earlier than the O’Level intake. Take these classes as foundation classes for students to catch up to their O’Level peers (especially since the difference between N’level standards and O’s is quite a jump). There aren’t any exams or tests, just suck it up and go through it (and make some friends along the way!)

For my course, all the dpp students were put together in a class. So we were quite lucky that the friends we made earlier on were going to be with us for the remaining 2 years.

**TIPS:**

* **Find out your study method!** do you score better in a supervised setting or are you more of a hands-on learner? If you’re the latter, the DPP route is certainly a better choice! (after all ITE is a technical education type of setting)
* **Know what you want to do!** don’t take up a dpp course just because you want to get out of your secondary school or skip sec 5. if you’re unsure whether the course is suitable for you, ask around for guidance (trusted secondary school teachers, your peers, your parents). Use elimination method if required: e.g I don’t see myself doing this, this, this, therefore i’m only left with this choices.
* **Know who to mix with!** there will be bad influences but honestly most of the closest friends I have now are my friends I gained through ITE.
* **You can still change your course when applying for poly!** however, make sure you have a portfolio available for your change and ensure that you are prepared for their questions during the interview (e.g why are you making this change etc.)
* **Your first sem grades are important!!!!** try your best to score. with only 4 semesters, it’s going to be difficult to pull your grades up subsequently if your first sem grades are bad.

**POLY:**

I managed to get into Leisure and Events Management(LEM) in TP (now known as HTM) with a 3.2 C.GPA upon my graduation from ITE. I struggled initially, adapting to how different ITE was from Poly and that we no longer had lecturers who were there to provide us with constant feedback on our work. Despite this, I still manage to perform better on certain modules as I had already studied the basics in ITE. In addition, the projects that I managed in ITE made projects in poly feel like a norm and easier for me to regurgitate the information required.

Overtime, it became a lot easier for me to adapt to my surroundings as I realised that the key to managing my school life was really time management. I wouldn't say its' impossible to have social life, sleep and still score well as I have many friends who manage to have all of it. However, if you can't that's okay too. Know your limits and know what is important to you. As I have a part-time job, I did not join any cca and prioritised my school work. I also gain CCA points through volunteering and other positions that did not require me to make any major long term commitment.

**TIPS:**

* **Start to understand yourself.** As I start to shift into adulthood, I start to realise that the events life may not be what I am looking for. As much as I love creating and executing them, doing it as a job may not be what I would want to pursue as a career. It was demoralising as I've been studying it for 5 years. But that's okay. Find other alternatives and know what you can build through this skill you have learnt. Read up, look at some soft skills that you have learn during your time in the course and what interest you. For myself, I found out that I have a keen interest in facilities management and find passion in arts related facilities and therefore, steering towards that direction for further education.
* **Back to basics!** Similar to ITE, your first sem grades are important! Try to focus on getting your basics right as most year 1 subjects are foundational. Also, keep these notes as you'll tend to refer to them for more information time to time. Even during my time in year 3, I still refer to my year 1 notes and projects for references as many key information are present.
* **Prioritise!!!!** Know what is important to you. Don't push yourself if you know you're at your limit and don't compare yourself with others. Its' normal to take a break sometimes. The number of times I've broken down because I felt so incompetent really took a toll on my mental health. But always, talk to someone. Its' okay to put yourself before your studies sometimes.
* **CCA.** As mentioned, I did not have any CCA but took up various positions and volunteering work that provided me with CCA points. For TP, taking up the class representative position and attending events offer students SEAL/CCA points. Don't give opportunities like this up. It may come in handy whether you are looking for friends or just aiming to get the points. These points are honestly, a booster, when it comes to university applications as it really helps in showing that you're an all rounded student (especially when they ask you to talk about how you contribute back to the community and demonstrate some of your leadership qualities).
* **Use internship as a trial**. Whether it is to try something new or work in an industry you're interested in, use your time as an intern to find out about the real world. Find out from your supervisor and colleagues. Observe what they do and how they tackle these situations. Use this time to find out if you can see yourself in this industry and if not, what are your alternatives. If required, you can always use the elimination method (what are your choices > removing your dislikes > your final choice)
* **Consult your lecturers.** When in doubt, always ask! Many lecturers are really keen on helping students. I often seek guidance from lecturers as they have insights and knowledge on the industry which can be really helpful in mapping what I would like to do in future. If you have doubts on which intern company would be suitable etc, you can always check with the lecturers for more information on the company.

&#x200B;

**Other tips:**

* **Your friends may not be the best group mates.** And that's okay. Different people have different working styles and sometimes, your working styles may clash and arguments may arise. However, try to work things out and not to ruin any friendship because of projects. Ensure both parties understand that the argument you guys had is based on the project and no hard feeling should be involved.
* **GO TO SCHOOL!** I know its' tempting to sleep in a few more hours and to skip classes but TRY to attend and go for every lecture and tutorials. Sometimes, its' better and easier to absorb information if you're listening to it first hand as compared to copying your friend's lecture notes.
* **Find out what kind of learner you are.** I personally am an audio learner when it comes to receiving information. However, I memorise better when my notes are hand written by myself. Find out what style suits you best and the best way for you to retain information as all these come in handy when memorising for close book exams.
* **Study ahead of time.** I really can't stress this enough but as tempting as it is to procrastinate, studying ahead of time really can help you prevent information from leaking especially when there are tests packed back to back.
* **Planner**. If you don't like to use a planner, your phone's calendar will do fine. Take down important dates (submissions, tests, exams) With a planner, you get to see a clear view of what is due and what is coming up in the month so to prepare yourself mentally and give yourself that sense of urgency that you probably need if you have been procrastinating.
* **Mental health.** Always take a break. Go out with your friends! Take a walk! Talk to your loved ones. School can be tiring and draining. But always remember there are people who are around you supporting you. Its' helpful to rant to someone especially when things can get a little too overwhelming.

&#x200B;

And I think that's about it! I graduated TP with an above 3.5 c.gpa and an 'excellent' record on my CCA points (about 60 points for TP standard). Will be attending NUS PFM this coming semester (nervous but excited). Its' been a long journey for me and hope this post will be helpful to anyone who needs it!!!

560,[Uni] Please research before choosing your Major!!,"From the r/NTU subreddit, I’ve seen a few people struggling with the workload and content of Bioengineering. This is just a small example of a bigger problem, not doing enough research before choosing majors. 

Many people associate the content of the Major with its name. IE Political science study Politics / Computer Engineering studies Computes. This works for the vast majority of the majors. But not for engineering. 

Chem Engineering DOES NOT MEAN CHEMISTRY!

Bioengineering DOES NOT MEAN BIOLOGY!

&#x200B;

Let’s take a look at some modules taken my NTU Chem engineering year 1 –

**CB1102 Introduction to Chemical and Biomedical Engineering**

CB1117 Engineering Mathematics

CB2106 Introduction to Multidisciplinary Engineering 

**CH1104 Materials & Energy Balance** 

CB1131 Engineering Fundamentals

CB1131 Introduction to Biomolecular Engineering

**CB2102 Organic Chemistry for Engineers**

CH1801 Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering

CH1802 Chemical & Biomolecular Engineering

MH1810 Math 

PH1011 Physics C

The only remotely ‘Chemistry’ modules are CB2102, whilst CB1102 & CH1104 are 50%.

&#x200B;

Next, how about Bioengineering – Picking only the remotely bio/biochem heavy modules from all 4 years.

BG1109 Anatomy and Physiology

BG2131 Biomaterials

BG2112 Cardiovascular Engineering

CB2102 Organic Chemistry for Engineers

That’s it, 4 out of 30+ core mods.

\*Chem/Bio mods can be taken as electives

[https://youtu.be/KQm-gfobUm8](https://youtu.be/KQm-gfobUm8) \- Bio/Biomedical Engineering

It’s obvious that people who only wish to pursuit Chem/Bio heavy majors, should not choose these two, as they are at their core – an engineering major. You really need a firm grasp of Physics and Maths in order to do well in such majors. I’ve seen some choose ChemE over Chem as a major as ChemE actually provided more job opportunities, but they themselves only interested in the chemistry aspect of it and struggle with the physics and engine mods. 

In Engi - you'll learn advanced applied maths concepts like (Laplace/Fourie Transform, Complex Analysis, Linear Algebra, Numerical Methods and Analysis) and Physics (Fluid Dynamics, Statics, Transfer systems). These are concepts relevant only to a niche area of Chem/Bio, the vast majority of Chem/Bio would not require this knowledge. 

Before choosing your Major, please really do your research and see if that's what you'll want to do for the next 4 years. Don't regret and change major midway through.

Cheers!

561,[O Levels][A Levels] Possible last advice before the end of Os.,"Hi, it's 6 Nov now. And you are left with Science MCQ, Business studies, Economics, Computing, French and MTL B or Special prog for O levels. For A level students it is the beginning with GP, Math shot down. Now here is my last advice I want to give before the end of O levels which could also apply to A levels.

*MT*

For those who feel like you cannot pass this subject, you are not alone. I too cannot pass Chinese either. But don't give up MT yet. Your aim right now is not to get a distinction. For JC and MI, O level students only requiee a merit or pass for MT B. And even if you do not pass MT, if you have 6 other subjects for JC if not 5 subjects for Poly/MI. Either ways, just try, who knows, you might actually get a pass for MT.

*MCQ questions*

But with that said, please do not forget to study your science mcq. I know it is ""easier"" but it will be more worth it if you score as high as possible. A few percentage can make a huge difference between grades.

*Tips for MCQ*

* Practice makes perfect. Do more MCQs and Paper 1.

* If legit cannot solve, use process of elimination and make a reasonable guess. 
* If legit cannot solve the qn or even understand what they are saying after 20 s, just skip, circle and come back later.
* Use the last 10 mins to check your OAS, did the answers align to the qns? 
* (Optional but it was useful for me for O levels so why not) Wear a watch and adjust it 1 to 2 mins earlier. E.g. Your exam starts at 2pm, your watch should shows 2:01/2:02. Focus on the last 2 digits. Now, I want you to try to aim and finish each qn under 1 each. Your aim right now is to beat the clock. For e.g if currently it is 2:05, you should be at Q5 now, if it is currently 2:08, you should be at Q8 now. The reason why I did this is because 1.It allows you to have a sense of time management and keep track on schedule, 2.I can skip and come back later which tends to be a advantage for some students because some actually struggle to skip the qn. And 3.you might end up accidently thinking the paper os over when actually you have 2 mins left which can allow you to calm down and focus on the 2 mins to check your answers and fill in any blank qns in the oas. But like I said, this is optional so it is not necessary to do this but this was what I did for MCQ qns. Still received an A2 and B3 for Chem and Physics anyways.

*After O Levels, It is not over yet*

Look, I know some of you screwed up the paper at some point and you might end up feeling like you are gonna collapse because you cannot go to the school you want/you have a feeling that you gonna fail. (I don't like to be harsh but...) you need to move on. Never let your O levels results make you feel like you cannot get to your dreams. For those aspiring JC, there are also poly/MI. For those aspiring poly, there is ITE which isnt really THAT bad. Plus, you can choose to retake O levels if need to. Take this time to cool down your nerves from O level and find something you like to do, e.g. finding new hobbies, getting part time jobs, hanging out with your friends for one last time. 

And tbh, it is normal to feel that feeling of failure only to get the results in O level that you wanted. I nearly thought I got a B4 for Chem and failed english and humanities(ss/his), I actually got an A2 for chem deapite nearly burning the lab and got B3 for both humans and eng. If you feel like this is gonna happen to you, try to make a backup plan, what course would you want to go if you never receive the results you wanted? 

Also lastly, find out exactly what course you want to do for jc/poly/mi and university because sometimes, there are people who enter the course only to regret going into this course and there are jc students who enter jc without knowing what they want to do after jc and certain uni courses require certain JC subjects. E.g. an Art student cannot take Medicine or Engineering require Physics etc. Plus, I heard that uni admissions was before poly graduation or smth(can someone confirm for me for this?)

563,[Poly]Overcontrolling parent dictating poly course?,"Did you ever have an overcontrolling parent, now or in the past for your poly courses? Although it was back in 2012, which is 8 years back, my mum was overcontrolling to the point of toxicity. I was an ADHD-PI child who could not focus in class and learnt nothing when i came back. I felt she didn't know how to handle me. In poly, she chose accounting for me. Despite her help, I barely passed the common test papers. I didn't know what to do in group work and i had no affinity for the group projects. Sat in class like a dumb rock and i was uninterested in the course choice.  It affected my mood and anxiety. Like once, during year 2 or 3, I wanted to quit the course. She tore up the paper and barricaded the door angrily, saying that I would have to start over. This part is very hard to show psychiatrists and doctors, she keeps her emotions in check during the psychiatrist sessions where she sits in with me. I switched to different courses in private uni, took up baking etc. Definitely much happier when I developed more autonomy. Like I know, if other people took the ""wrong course"" in poly, they would switch out without a doubt to another course, waste a year or two. But she was like ""quit la"" but when I tried to do it, she went apeshit.

Is this the right sub to post in?

I would like to know:

1. How are you coping now?
2. How did you get over it?
3. Did you eventually carve out a different path for yourself?
4. If this didn't apply to you, and you are a neurodivergent learner, did your parents try to nurture your strengths? Or at least find a job which you could work in?

I'm currently in JC2 and will be taking the A lvls this yr. My parents has been vv controlling of the amount of time I spent on electronic devices and how I manage my time etc. However, with the CB going on, my parents being at home everyday will meant that they have more time to care about what I do and what I shouldn't do. They insist that I study 24/7 and have no idea about the meaning of taking breaks and the possibility of having a burn out. While it is true that I do spent an adequate amount of time on the internet, I felt like I really do need the break to save myself from having a burn out in the future. Recently, they started to threaten to confiscate my phone but with all lessons been moved to online and announcement messages sent out by teachers needed to be acknowledged ASAP at this time of crisis, they still cound not understand my plight and felt that they have the right to do whatever they want. Ironically, they want me to do well but at the same time, what they are doing also risk jeopardising my studies. I had many past frictions with them but they always say about what having a nice peaceful family when they are not willing to communicate with their kids,listen about what they have to say and talk it out nicely?

567,[rant] I've learnt nothing from PW.,"PW/OP is finally over and there's only InR left but somehow I'm not happy at all.

&#x200B;

I know PW is supposed to be the most useful subject in JC but I've learnt nothing. Instead of learning how to work in a group, I learnt that I'm absolutely terrible at working with others. Instead of learning how to do evaluative/analytical writing I've learnt that hard work means absolutely nothing (I mean, I knew that before, but I really hated doing PW so I'm even more mad that spending so much time and effort on PW didn't translate into anything concrete). Instead of preparing me for the ""real world"" (whatever that's even supposed to mean) I've learnt that I'll never be ready for the ""real world"".

&#x200B;

I know a lot of people are glad that the WR and OP exam is finally over (for those who alr finished OP) but all I can think of is how all our teachers (even the non-PW ones) keep telling us that this is our one chance to learn groupwork?? And that it's the most relevant subject and that ""uni work is just like PW""?? Which means all my terrible experiences this year mean that I won't survive in uni / the workplace?? And this is compounded by the fact that I learnt ABSOLUTELY NOTHING from these experiences. I didn't ""learn and grow"" from all the obstacles we faced in PW. I just kept thinking ""wow I have absolutely no idea how to communicate with my teammates and here we go again with the same routine of 14 hours a week on just one subject where most of my effort goes into not screaming vulgarities at my teammates over skype / throwing my laptop out the window"". 

&#x200B;

I've learnt nothing this year from this subject. Not how to work in a team, not how to communicate ideas efFecTiveLy, just - nothing. I guess that means I'm set up to fail for life coz I'm not gonna survive uni (yes i'm being sarcastic and dramatic but also that's the messaging I got from teachers)

&#x200B;

I didn't initially hate PW. I tried to find what I liked about it, but then my anger and bitterness started piling up and I just never enjoyed this subject ever again. I kept going because I thought of all my teachers who said ""this is the most relevant/important/useful subject in JC"" but now that I've reached the end of PW, I realised that... what's the point... of being the most useful subject... if I'd learnt nothing from it...

&#x200B;

I don't know who or what I'm angry at. Angry at everyone around me for being like ""oH thIs iS thE mOsT usEfUl suBjeCt"" and then I believed it and then now, only in November, realised that it doesn't even matter because I learnt nothing from PW?

But now, after going through a week or so of JC life, I start feeling very anxious and worried about if I made the right choice. Friends/environment wise, I do quite like it but in terms of the academics and the rigour, I'm quite worried I won't be able to keep up for the next two years.

Most of my friends are going to Poly and I always see them having so much fun and so much free time that I also get quite jealous, in a sense? I feel like if I had gone to Poly I would also have more free time and most of all, be happier.

Hi, so you may know me from the previous post. I decided to share my story on O levels. 

So yea, many of you may know, I was from a JC. But to be fair, I was from a 199 pointer school. SMBSS. Also, not many people get distinctions in the subjects they took.

I stepped in Sec 3. Chinese sucked. My huamans barely pass, regretted even takig history. English? Ha didnt pass. The only subjects that I aced on was Math, Amath and the two pure sciences(P,C)

And then come Sec 4, we were the last batch of students taking the older syllabus pure Chem and Physics spa, so our practical is seperated into different days. I still recalled, me, being the only one left to distill water away for crystallisation to occur. In short, I screwed up chem....or so as I thought.

I and then Math prelim came, wow A1, sure can do well for O level.....I screwed up the qn....taking a long time to do the siti question. I left the siti qn incomplete. Incomplete. First time I actially DIDN'T COMPLETE Maths. Wow(p.s. yes, at this point we were wondering whether we were supposed to be using string or ruler to measure her route.) Same for combi science paper. 

And came chem paper, there was a question regarding about how in the past, symbols are used to represent elements instead of short form. I screw that qn up as I did not understand it. And for Physics, I wrote the speed of light as 3×10^6(it was supposed to be 8)

At that point in time, they may seem like miniscule errors, but to me, especially for someone who wanted to just pass O levels and is seem as someone who is ""diligent"", it was huge to me. I kept on consistently feeling like failure. Feel like I might go poly. My anxiety turned worser to the point I wonder what people would think of me, especially since I was known as ""the smart one"" with high expectations.

* What did I learn from O level result release:

1. What you thought was not what you MIGHT expect. 

I got an A2 for Chem even my teacher found shocking. I got a B3 for both English and Combined Humans even though I did not complete Combined Humans. And as a person who consistently failed Chinese, I passed with a C6. 

It is normal to be feel anxious and it is normal to feel guilty that ""you did not study hard enough"". There are people who actually turn out great, even for some of my friends who unexpected got less than 20 points for L1R5. 

2.The importance of bringing a JAE booklet even though it may not be necessary.

For one of my friend, it was a sad case. He wanted to go JC with me, ended up with a L1R5 of 20+ even though he studied hard. I had to give up my JAE booklet to him (as instructed by my form teacher). 

If you ever fail your goals, find a career guidance counsellour and bring your JAE booklet. They can give guidance as to which place you want to go to and how to make your decision, like a doctor giving prescription.

There are other ways to go to higher ed. Some retook O levels, some went to low tier JC or poly, some went to ITE and others went to art schools like NAFA and LaSalle. Some even went on to complete NS first.

3.Be there for your friends. You will never know what could happen to them. And sadly they may not know what avenues of help to go to. 

Going to JC, I saw the same extra stuff that happened. People getting ""disowned"" when tehy did not receive good results. People using alcohol to destress. People being forced/pressured to go JC despite wanting to go poly. 

In this O level result release, it is like a ship sinking in the sea, either you are the sailor who gives up and drowns, the sailor who swims to survive or the life raft to save the sailors. 

I wrote many advices in this reddit page not because I want to gain popularity or whatsoever, I wrote many advices because I have seen people who ended up losing their way in life. At some points, I can't help them but I have been there with them and at the same time looking through the reddit posts, I don't want you to lost your way and give up. 

As for my friends, most did not go to the courses they gone, some went to ITE, but they are happy with their life, even moving on to Polytechnic and I am happy for them.

What lies ahead tomorrow and the choices you make determine what consequences and result will happen. Good luck and may fortune be on your side. Don't lose hope.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kuglqo/o_levels_why_i_decide_to_write_advice_for_this/,True,2021-01-11 07:40:40
574,[A Levels] A thank you to r/SGExams,"Hi everyone! I'm a J2 student who just finished As yesterday (weird arts combi gang lmao) so I just felt like saying a big thank you to this sub for keeping me going for the past few months.

It had been a pretty stressful period for me for the past 9 weeks or so since the end of my prelims. As had always seemed so far, but with it creeping closer and closer day by day, the pressure was admittedly getting to me. My prelims results weren't exactly stellar either, which worsened my self-esteem issues. I inexplicably found myself on this sub, where I remember spending days trying to read all the A Levels flaired-posts.

Was I seeking advice? Validation? Some kind of universality to my experiences? To be honest, I don't really remember. What I do remember, however, is how encouraging this community was. It wasn't uncommon to see posts about people feeling anxious, worried, burnt out or just straight up demoralised, but the comment sections were always filled with encouraging messages and advice that truly, um, ""warmed the cockles of my heart"". Though I wasn't usually the one requiring advice, I really felt a sense of community within this subreddit. In fact, I felt compelled to give advice and share my own experiences as well, something I hadn't intended to do (or expected to be in any position to in the first place).

At the end of it all, I just want to reiterate my thanks for this sub really helping me to get through the most challenging part of my JC experience. Y'all helped me to persevere through the pain and I couldn't be more grateful for having made it this far. And for those who are still taking As: don't give up just yet! You're almost at your destination, you just gotta hold on and keep fighting. I wish you all nothing but the best for your remaining papers, and I hope you'll come out of them with no regrets just like I've done with mine.

Hi everyone, I am feeling unconfident and unmotivated with regards to A levels. my maths is like the bottom 30 (people) in the cohort and i barely got 25 rank points for mid years (including my pw grade) and everything just seems out of reach now ... i don’t even know if the math papers i’m doing in school are helpful because almost half the cohort failed the mid year math exam paper and everything just seems bad. i did pretty decently for o levels but i’m really not seeing the possibility of that repeating at As and honestly i’m aiming for law course at local uni so i know just how challenging it will be if i want to enter them. any word of advice would be appreciated as i’m feeling rather lost and dejected ... still in the midst of taking my prelims and everything is just  bad",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ils891/jc_struggling/,True,2020-09-04 04:13:44

581,[O LEVELS] an encouragement to those who will be collecting their results on 11 Jan 2021,"Your results do not dictate your future. They might have an impact on your immediate future, they might affect what uni you go to or what course you get on to, but they don’t dictate your entire future. If your results have knocked your plans slightly, it doesn’t mean that you can never get onto the course you always wanted to do. It doesn’t mean that you can’t get the career you’ve been dreaming of. Not everybody goes straight from school into their dream course, and then got a job in their dream career (in fact very few people do!) and sometimes, the best things in life can come from an unexpected change in direction.

&#x200B;

Exam result only measure one aspect of you. They measure how well you are at completing coursework and how good you are in exams. They don’t measure how kind you are, how well you look after your younger siblings and how often you’re there for your friends. They don’t measure how many books you’ve read, how amazing your latest craft project was or how much everyone loves your baking. They just measure how good you are at a handful of subjects, assessed by a narrow selection of assessment method. 

&#x200B;

Whatever your results may be, I am already proud of you. I know that you did your best, and I want you to know that your best is good enough, even if it doesn’t feel like it at times. Your best is good enough. It’s okay to be happy with your results, it’s okay to feel disappointed, but I want you to remember that whatever your results are, you are not your results and they do not define you.

&#x200B;

These grades are only the beginning of a new chapter, not a roadmap of your life. Drive wherever you want and enjoy the journey. And most importantly don’t worry so much; nothing in life is perfect and you end up exactly where you were always meant to be.

&#x200B;

I am wishing my fellow sec4s/sec5s class of 2020 all the best for results day !! Whatever result you attain, it's a reflection of your own hard work.

583,[JC] What are your reasons for studying/working hard?,"TLDR: Help a dumb child in a JC stuDYING.

Throughout my life, I mostly went into exams with the bare minimum and just did the questions on the spot. Somehow, it worked for most subjects. For the subjects where you needed more than just equations (like Geog and Chem), I memorised the bare minimum to get a B to land myself in a JC.

To put it simply, I'm lazy. I've never studied. I don't know how to study except for last minute memorisation. It works, I did okay in Promos, but I want to actually study in J2 and I literally don't know how to start.

Hope someone can shed some light on what pushes them to study/revise/even look at their notes. I really want to break away from this unhealthy cycle of not studying and cramming shit into my head last minute before the exams. Even though I could promote, I feel like I'm leaving J1 with nothing in my brain except my PW report.

There is this common type of question that comes out for other school test papers and even O levels. State the relationship between Genes,Chromosomes and DNA.

This is causing me quite a bit of trouble as i do not know how to hit all the points. I am not sure what to write when it is a 6m question. I have seen this exact question come out with marks varying from 3m to 6m

Overall, i feel that molecular genetics is one of my worst topics for bio and i need like some study tips as im not sure why but feel that it is quite different from other chapters. I cant seem to link them all together between Genes, Chromosomes, Alleles, DNA. Is it just me?


I hope that anyone else encountering the same problem would find a solution here when somebody posts an answer. Atb to everyone taking their o levels this year.

591,[O Levels] is it wise to pull an all nighter while preparing for the O’s?,"When I got back my prelim results of 16 ( or 15 I can’t rmb), I was really disappointed because I studied intensively for my sciences but ended up with a C6 for Bio and F9 for Chem. For the rest of my subjects, I barely studied, just did a few practices here and there then entered the exam hall. I managed to score an A1-2. 

I have so many learning gaps for sciences and we. have. a. month. or. so. left. So here’s the question, should I stay up late/ maybe pull an all nighter while preparing for O’s? I’m definitely not a morning person, I can’t do my revision at 7am in the morning but somehow I have the energy to pull through the whole night and maybe sleep at 5am. Pure sciences are content heavy subjects and I don’t want my L1R5 for O’s to be dragged thanks to my sciences. At the same time, I don’t want to neglect my other subjects and improve slightly further. (EMath is constant drilling) But looking at the amount of days we have left, I’m not sure if I can finish my revision by the time O’s begin. 

I really fear getting a 16 again as my L1R5 for O’s since I’m aiming for a single digit L1R5. Is it too late to improve my sciences?

594,[rant] USELESS physics teacher,"Yall... I don't even know where to start. Physics Paper 2 is in a few days time and I am absolutely unprepared. I've been failing Physics ever since Secondary 3 (legit F9/E8 all the way) but I got lucky during Prelims and managed to barely pass. Anyways I just wanted to rant about my Physics teacher. He always comes late to class. I'm not even exaggerating when I say ALWAYS. I remember there were times (MORE THAN ONCE) when he forgot that we had Physics lessons and he didn't show up until like 15min later. This doesn't sound TOO bad, but hold on. 

Yall know how every teacher will do some last minute revision in preparation for Os, for example they will go through some of the more difficult topics? However my teacher just struts into class 15min late, throws us some papers to do, then sits on the chair and play games on his phone. I am 100% serious here 🤡 I've seen him play these games with my own fucking eyes and I really find it disgusting as to how he holds a position of authority in our school. Also, he doesn't even go through the paper with us, he just sends us the answer key via whatsapp and tbh, doesn't even care if we have finished the paper or not and doesn't bother keeping check. Even if he does go through papers, its always an unproductive lesson because he doesn't know how to fucking do the questions. LIKEEE IM NOT EVEN JOKING, HE DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DO PHYSICS QUESTIONS okok let me just tell yall. There was once he spent like, 30min (aka HALF THE LESSON) on drawing the force triangle/parallelogram, when the lesson ended he still couldn't figure it out and just left the class saying ""I'll continue next lesson"" lmao sure thing bro. We asked another Physics teacher and they were able to solve it easily. 

Yall might be thinking ""at least he can teach content, right?"" WELL NO LMFAO he taught us a shit ton of wrong stuff and is super fucking unreliable. We've cross checked his notes with the textbook and let me just say... it was all so very confusing.

Let me just add one more thing. He takes so fucking long to mark a paper. He rarely marks our papers but when he does, it takes AGES for him to return. There was a paper we did before CB and he only returned it to us a few weeks before school ended. (it wasn't even a full paper or anything, just 4-5 practice questions) and u can bet that he didn't fucking go through it 🤡

Ok last thing lol. For Physics practical, we didn't even know the swapping over after 55mins existed until like, Prelims. He didn't tell us until a few weeks before Prelims, and prior to Os, we only did like 2 full practices for practical. This is why I'm honestly expecting a fail for Physics lol. I can help yall pull down the bell curve hahahaha.

Thanks for reading :) I just needed a place to vent. Lmk your thoughts on this Physics teacher hahahahah and I'm sorry for the vulgarities 😬

 As a seasonal purveyor of  ""cram everything 48 hours before exam"" who've yet started revision I'm lowkey at a loss. Having never pre-prepped for any of my tests/ exams (inclusive of promos) more than 2 days in advance, I'm disturbingly laxxed at this stage but not really sure what or where to begin with. Most of my friends have been clocking over  5 hours of mugging per day but I'm not sure if that's useful in my case since my information retention abilities are practically non-existential and I'll probably forget everything by the time A's roll around. Having completed the whole syllabus there's really not much work to be done & I'm left with an abundance of free time (that should very obviously be spent on studying, but, like, yeah) and unfortunately not much drive.

596,[O Levels] Any success stories of F's to straight A's for O's? Need motivation.,"Alright, the title is self explainatory.

I've been feeling pretty stressed I guess. Getting rejected for EAE means that I'll have to work twice as hard for JAE since the course I'm looking at is one of the tougher ones to get into.

I'm not confident that I can do it. For context, I scored pretty badly for sec3 EOY with an l1r5 of >30. However, I guess I have been improving as CA1 was alright. Mostly low B's and low C's, and I failed only two subjects. But I don't think I'm moving fast enough. I don't know if I'll be able to jump to A's in time for O levels.

I need motivation. Any stories of anyone you know (or even yourself) who did meh, but ended up doing really well for O's?

Sorry if this seems weird, but I just need an extra boost of motivation. If I see others can do it, I'll believe more that I can do it too.

Hope that others will find this useful as well. Jiayous everyone!

EDIT: I think my intentions have come off wrongly. I want to clarify that I am NOT trying to find excuses to slack!! :( I just need reassurance that a student who is very far behind like me can score well. I'm so sorry if my intentions came off wrongly. But, I'm thankful for everyone's replies. Again, so sorry for the misunderstanding :(

597,[A Level] [O Level] A guide for secondary school students to taking JC Literature in English. AMA if you'd like,"*Hello, I've been seeing some posts on here on taking lit in JC, so I thought I'd share about my experiences with taking lit and how its taught and what you'll have to do as a lit student. Bear in mind that every school will have different teaching styles and every student will have different experiences. Don't take what I say as a fact! Do your own research and ask the teachers and students from the school you're planning to go to.*

**Syllabus**

There are three papers in the H2 lit syllabus: *Reading Literature*, *Renaissance Literature*, and *The Mind and Self in Literature*. Paper 1, *Reading*, is compulsory for all students, and is a general introduction to literature. Papers 2 and 3 are electives, specialising on certain aspects of literature, and each school will teach either 2 or 3. For instance, Raffles Institution teaches 2, so all students take *Renaissance* alongside *Reading.* I am not from Raffles, and I took 1 and 3.

*Paper 1* focuses on the general techniques of English literature, like close reading and practical criticism. You'll learn how to analyse prose, poems, and drama texts, which comprise the three essays that you'll have to do in the A level. You'll be given three hours to complete the three essays: the *unseen* and two set-texts. The *unseen* is a set of two poems that you'll have to compare, whereas the other two essays that you'll write are based on books that you've read. In total, there are two books for this paper. You'll do the novel in your first year, and the drama in your second.

Paper 2 focuses on Renaissance literature, of Ben Jonson and Shakespeare's time. I did not do this paper and am not familiar with the syllabus.

Paper 3 is similar to 1 but bears the overarching theme of *the mind and self* in literature. Your questions for 3 will be similar to 1 but will always relate to *the mind and self.* It also comprises three essays in three hours: an *unseen*, a *comparison*, and a *set-text* question. The *unseen* for 3 is unlike 1 as it only has one poem to analyse; the *comparison* for 3 is unlike the *unseen* in 1 as it requires you to compare two set-texts. You will read three books for this paper. The first year will see you read the novel, while the second will see you read the two books for the comparison.

H1s are not so fortunate, and they'll only get to do Paper 1, except their *unseen* will only have one poem.

**Doing Literature**

Jon Pareles' [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/arts/music/sufjan-stevens-the-ascension-review.html) in The New York Times, titled S*ufjan Stevens’s Cry of Despair and Prayer for Redemption,* is what doing literature is like, barring the musical aspect. Literature is an actual *art,* unlike economics or history. *Doing* literature involves the analysis of language—extracting meaning from words and syntax and providing visceral and intelligent responses to the written word. In essays, you will analyse the *art* of literature, writing about the effects of stories—how they make you laugh and cry—and their underlying meanings. You will immerse yourself in language, putting yourself in someone else's shoes, and in your essays you will say nothing more than your own experience with the piece.

It's a fun subject, but it is skill-based. If you have an aptitude towards language, and if you enjoy reading, you'll enjoy literature very much. And even if you don't, there is still much aesthetic beauty in the subject. It's not a subject for everyone, but it's a very rewarding one.

**Addendum:**

*The following are new sections based on questions I've received.*

**Lessons**

The most exciting part about literature lessons are the wonderful and lucid discussions that you'll get the opportunity to have in tutorials. There are lectures and tutorials, but tutorials are unlike those of other subjects, for you will have an opportunity to share what you think and feel about the subject. What you say *is* actually important and your insights can contribute towards a wider understanding of a piece. Tutors don't have all the possible interpretations and you're always welcome to share your opinion in class.

599,[O Levels] more nervous about posting results than I was for o level results release,"

Don’t get me wrong , I was really nervous about receiving results ( which was dismaying) but after placing in my 12 choices , in which the first four after jc choices followed by 8 poly choices , I’m fooking nervous . I think I made my mind up since the beginning of Sec 4 that I wanted to get into a jc so badly . Poly never appealed to me but my parents , in which my mom used to be a lecturer at rp and is now at ite continued to share the negative sides of jc and painted poly in such a good light , constantly telling my relatives and friends that they hope I get posted to a poly instead . Yet , I still have my eyes set on jc . Don’t get me wrong , the poly choices I placed are really good courses ( mass comm courses ) but deep inside my heart I just know that I really need a structured learning environment , generic subjects and also because I have no idea of what I intend to do in life . So with my l1r5 nett of 14 and l1r4 nett of 11 , I pray every single night that I don’t get posted into a poly but I get posted to either one of my four choices , namely the science and arts courses at tmjc and cjc .
So will I get posted to a jc and actually be happy about my results yet live through two years of constant stress?or will I be posted to a poly where I can lead a more flexible school life but one where I won’t be happy ?

602,[Poly] How I take notes in Poly and improved my grades,"Hello again! I thought it might just help to share some tips about how to write notes.

Disclaimer: These tips worked for me but it's always up to you to determine your studying method. Pick and choose tips or none at all! I hope you still find this an insightful read.

**Lectures**

1) Read your lecture notes before the class starts or better, before the semester

2) Highlight! I can't stress this enough but highlight important phrases, diagrams, percentages etc. Use a Neon Yellow or Orange highlighter

3) I had a classmate who recorded audio notes of the lecture and then replayed it to add notes so this might help

**Taking Notes**

1) Try acronyms! It is so fun and makes memorizing much easier because the overall word won't make sense but dissecting every letter will make you remember better 

2) Use the 5Ws and 1H as a basic outline of your chapter. Write the title above and then proceed with your content

3) There are two ways to write notes: on your computer or writing down 

Computer:

A. Program: Microsoft Word

B. Fonts: Max. 3 different fonts to just jazz up your notes but remain consistent (each font for title, content and mini notes) 

C. Font size: 11/12

D. Use Bold to highlight the sub-titles 

E. Page Border: Narrow

F. Columns: 2 

G. Page orientation: horizontal 

H. Printing black and white because colour is expensive? I feel ya. Use underline or highlight in a grey shade or box the words or use arrows! Once you print, you can annotate after 

I. Printing in colour is always the best when printed in school or a shop outside. I have a HP printer but the ink always smudges when I highlight so I end up printing at school

J. Ctrl+S ALWAYS!

K. Instead of mindmaps, I write everything in a systematic manner where it literally depicts a combination of MY thought process and the content. When you do so, you don't confuse yourself by searching the notes because you will read it like a story. Your notes are a story and this will ensure your brain is following through and understanding which is why I use the 5W 1H. 

\*\*For example: 

What is economics? 

It is a social science concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services

Why study economics? 

It studies how businesses, governments and nations make choices allocating resources to satisfy their wants and needs.............

Examples of resources: land (elaborate with 1-2 words and follow through with the rest), capital, labour and entrepreneurship 

(In the above example, highlight the question in Bold, underline it and/or change the font type or make it slightly bigger)

L. If you are using the above Word settings, I think you'll find that you tend to shorten your sentences and cut straight to the content. There is lesser space and it's on purpose! And that's why I stuck to this method. Because there's no BS, just actual tested content so I need to be careful of what I write

M. Print your notes in short-edge and double-sided pages. This way, you can fold into half and carry around without the words smushing together. 

Added plus point which I love: a 24 page document is just 12 pages and fits alright in your palm. It's light enough to hold in the MRT without the weight. Visually, you will trick yourself into thinking that wow, really it's really not a lot of content when it actually is 

N. Lastly, if you have space in your paper in between paragraphs etc, put some cute animal icons. It'll cheer up your notes a bit :) 

Writing down:

I would follow every step in the computer section except just do it into a piece of A4 paper. Remember to staple! And always always always, pick an A4 paper or single-lined paper that is SMOOTH. 

I have done both but I prefer a computer most of the time just because it's faster. 

**Memorizing**

\- Take a whiteboard or even those single pocket files and write out what you memorise in marker.

\- Test every section and write it down. If you want to be stringent, for every point you missed you must redo the entire section. If you want to be nice, complete memorizing the entire section and then fill out what you missed. With muscle memory, I feel like this is what forced me to memorize my acronyms and the contents associated. 

**Bonus Tip!**

If you really want to go to town with your notes and make it *even simpler*, use post-its and write the key points of the page by section on each post it. The goal here is to put even a SMALLER number of words but the KEYWORDS that essentially need to come up in your actual answer. Visually, you only see maybe 6 post-its (depending on the actual content of your typed out chapter). You give yourself the illusion that ""oh hey this chapter is only 6 post it's and if I manage to remember this, I got my key points down""

Completed ITE and poly but I felt like re-taking English again next year, do you guys think it’s necessary? I’m in  ns now and have lots of free time, so juggling with just 1 subject won’t be much of an issue.

606,"[University] Rejected for both full time and part-time university option for this ""old"" person. Feel rather dejected now.","I did and completed National Service rather late due from depression in short there is rather a gap between the year of my NS. IT was around 2018 and I thought well my life going to turn for the better after NS and I applied SIT and SUTD. I graduated from Polytechnic but my grades are not good.  Took a part time job to wait for it it. The result came out well I got rejected from both which sucked alot. I know my grade graduating from polytechnic could get into NUS and NTU  so I don't bother trying. Applied over to australia too and one for Malaysia University as I see that to be a cost effective solution. For the Malaysian university, it get rather frustrating I have to explain my gaps years for education to them and saying depression is not a thing I wanted, said I did service and that is all. I got rejected for that although it related to my field of study in polytechnic.

Got an offer for Australia but I have to turn it down as its too expensive I tried getting a full time job after that but all I get was a short contract tem position which pay only as good as part time. The jobs so far have no relation to my field of study. Even jobs are hard to come by in 2018. At the back of mind knowing my abilities and my emotions I am ""ok"" but knowing people getting and doing well just eat at me. 

I saw Nus and Ntu part time study. Tried again. The nus requires an exam to pass but I find it rather difficult. In short well that rejected. The ntu part time rejection was rather recent this year got a call for interview. The interview do said that my chances are rather low as I am not in the field of study which sure enough I got the rejection later. The irony when in my field work I worked with univesity interns and teach them too...


So yeah..feeling rather stuck now.  I am getting ""old"" now in my late 20s with little youth left and I feel like I have lost my chances already. I envy reading the reddit subs knowing how young you guys are. Always do your best guys time is alot of your side.

My job contract is ending soon, I hope to at least improve my skill in way in a study or such.

607,[Uni] or Poly or Anyone in a Group Project: What is YOUR best way to facilitate a group project?,"Pretty much the title, very curious on how other people do their projects, especially those people with near-perfect or perfect GPAs.

1. Do you:
• Have meetings that last for 1 hour?
• Have meetings that last for 6-7 hours?
• Delegate and then “polish” the parts you get back?
• Just tank everything yourself?
• Any other ways?

2. What did you do/how did you execute your projects BEFORE COVID-19 and right now, DURING COVID-19?

3. Do you mostly take the initiative to step up and lead the group? If yes, why? If no, why not?

Please feel free to share your experience. Thanks a bunch!

EDIT:
4. Thank you guys for replying, didn't expect to get so many! Since I've seen many people who've said to ""be prepared"" to tank the whole thing yourself, I'm now curious; have you ever had to do so; did it take a mental toll on you? 

5. I'm curious about your results too- with your certain workstyles, have you gotten consistent As or Distinctions; or has it been very mixed, sprinkled in with some Bs or Cs here and there?

Thank you guys. I'm asking this because HBL has forced me to adapt and rethink the way I do stuff, and I really want to improve myself, moving forward.

I was supposed to do a paper two practice paper today but I fell asleep. it's 12:53am.. I should probably do it now. 


but girl I'm not even gonna do it anymore because 我觉得无论我练习多少，我还是会不及格。这也有我自己来怪。之前的 HBL 我没好好得使用时间来练习，就是要偏偏得等到最后一分钟才准备。 


I take 7 subjects and you probably already know I'm not gonna rely on my mother tongue, but it's always better to have a back up subject in case I don't do well for my other subjects. and it's not like I'm confident in my other subjects as well. 


it's such a bad timing to feel unmotivated. the only thing keeping me sane when studying is the thought of failure to keep my promise. lol told many people I want to aim for JC so I'm honestly predicting their disappointment when I don't get into the JC I want.


sorry this turned out to be sort of a rant. I don't have anyone to confide this into because the rest of my friends are extremely good in Chinese and when ever they tell me ""just do it lah"" it makes me not wanna do it more. plus, I don't want to disappoint my parents. they're not really an active supporter in my studies, and they leave it up to me to decide for my future , so confiding this in them is just gonna turn into a lecture or me feeling guilty as fuck.


however, I'm thinking of retaking it already. I've already consulted my teacher about it and she reminded me of the other papers I'm taking at the end of the year. is retaking it recommended? cause if yes I'm just gonna continue practising my Chinese even after Os, though I won't religiously focus on it like I'm partially doing now.

&#x200B;

(1): Expos and logs very briefly turned up in the Kinematics qn of P1. But laws of logs haven't came out yet, so that's sure to turn up. Expos may come out as one of those substitution questions, e.g. (e^(x) \- 1)(e^(x) \+ 2) = 0.

(2): **Your syllabus is the last time Cambridge can test these two subtopics in AMath.** If I were Cambridge, I'd go all-out for these.

(3): **Your syllabus is the last time Cambridge can test the modulus function.** Given that modulus only took 4 marks from P1, it might turn up again in Paper 2, such as by making you draw the graph of the modulus of some trigo function.

(4): **Your year is answering in the question booklet. The 'graph paper' grid will be provided.** ***That means it likely will be wholly black in colour, so be mentally-prepared for that.***

&#x200B;

Next, some miscellaneous advice.

* Discriminant works for anything with a ^(2). For example, you can prove a line is a tangent to a circle via showing Discriminant = 0.
* For questions like surds and maxima-minima, you might get some weird geometry question. **You'll need your EMath formulas**, since they're not in the AMath formula sheet and you don't know if Cambridge will pull a *sneaky* and decide not to give it to you.  
**If you get the formula wrong, and the question is only 1-part** (e.g. surds qn, 1 part, 6 marks), **it's instant-death for the whole question. Marking schemes almost always give an instant-zero.** Be dummy-careful. **I cannot emphasize this enough.** Get the crap like volume of cone, surface area of sphere etc memorized.  
But hopefully the qn will give, where relevant.
* There was ZERO graph-sketching in P1. P2 might be a total frick-fest of curves. This ties back especially into (1) and (2) too.
* Remember to draw in asymptotes where relevant, and label all x- and y-intercepts that can be reasonably-obtained.
* Binomial theorem is a hecking tedious topic, so you don't want to rush it, lest you get a careless mistake in the first few steps and get demolished.
* Notice how the shoelace method uses |chopsticks| ? If you go in the wrong order when choosing the points, you can slap a modulus onto it and turn the negative final ans into a positive one. You won't be penalized.
* Shoelace method always works, sure, but sometimes it might be as simple as half-base-height or trapezium formula.
* Did you know, the gradient of a line is the inverse-tangent of the angle the line forms with the right half of the x-axis? e.g. y = -x forms an angle of 135 degrees with the x-axis.
* Again, if linear law comes out as a plotting qn, prepare to draw on ""black graph paper"". I'm not recommending that you draw with a pen, but... save some time for this qn if it comes out, because you might take longer than expected.
* **R-Formula** **is not in the formula sheet.** Make sure you **really** know what you're doing.
* For R-Formula and Maxima-minima qns with trigo proving, the strat is similar to normal trigo proving qns.  

Start off with ""WTF sia"" - what to find sia??? look at the RHS (i.e. the final answer), and check for certain clues. For example, is everything in the RHS *only* sin? Then you might have to use 1 - cos^(2) x = sin^(2) x. Is there a ""2θ"" in the RHS? Pay attention to the sin 2θ and cos 2θ identities (all variants of cos 2θ, please.)  

Once you do your WTF, and know what to look out for, you'll have some idea of what to do, e.g. ""I must work towards 1 - cos^(2) x to force out some sines"".  

If diagrams are given, try to create rectangles and right-angled triangles that can help you out.
* Maxima-minima might legit be trigo... because the stationary points qn in P1 was ""easy"" enough to let students do 2nd derivative test. If I were Cambridge, I would make the algebra in P2 nasty to force students to do the 1st derivative test... and the easiest way to make the algebra wacc is to use trigo, lol.
* The gradient of a tangent at P(p , q) is the value of dy/dx when x = p. The normal is perpendicular.
* Make sure you know how to manipulate rates of change.  

dy/dt = dy/dx   dx/dt.  

While they cannot explicitly test dx/dy = 1 / (dy/dx), you **are** allowed to use this trick.

When i say i screwed up i rlly mean it so. Rn im really trying hard to fight this feeing of despair and stop thinking about whats done. I think we all should focus on P1 and P2 theres still 80% more to go ! I rmb this year’s june mtl o lvl i tot i did VERY badly and i felt so demoralised after i compared my ans on reddit and got 18/30 for mcq section which was not good at all as my aim was A1. But i still tried my best for LC n oral and in the end when i got back my results i got an A1 ! So my point here is try not to compare your ans and get sad now instead lets try to do our best for the rest of the papers. I’ll admit it’s difficult to do that because rn im oso rlly sad but lets try to overcome that feeling and move on ! i believe in you that and that you are capable of doing well for the rest of the papers so dont let this practical ruin your drive ! jiayous hang in there a few more weeks this hell will be over :)

622,[Rant] JC vs Poly vs ITE by a JC grad,"Heyo! I was a student at Anderson JC for 2015-2016, and managed to pursue engineering at SUTD (ISTD pillar / Info Systems). I graduated late August. My older sibling went to poly and my younger sibling is currently in ITE. 

Based on what our experiences are, here is the general comparison:

* Cost: JC < ITE < POLY
* Academic rigour: ITE < JC (written) \~ POLY (practical/internship)
* Career guidance: ITE + Polytechnic usually have internship opportunities. My JC didn't have an internship fair or opportunities.
* Career prospects after graduation: You are more likely able to find a job with a poly or ITE diploma. An A level cert alone is good mainly for getting into uni, or working at a tuition centre if they ask for it.
* Social status: JC > POLY > ITE but as a JC kid, I don't believe in this. It's just what my parents and secondary school teachers have been repeating.

Warning: huge braindump here. All my views here are my own and/or my siblings, and not meant to consciously ""hate"" on certain people or academic pathways.

**TL;DR**

If you need someone to tell you that you will turn out fine not going to JC, and that you will do perfectly fine going to poly of ITE, I'm that person. It comes down to how you want to get a job, and whether you are capable and willing to deal with whatever life and society throws at you.

**My Experiences after going through JC**

If I knew what I wanted to pursue as a career, I would definitely go poly instead of JC because I believe I would be more suitable in a more hands-on culture rather than the fast-paced mugging in JC. However, I still didn't know what I wanted to do back then. Knowing that poly was more ex for my middle-class income family, I chose JC because two years and annual fees are still cheaper than poly.

I felt constantly pressured and had trouble catching up. Legit was staying up till 3am to complete homework and revise. My self-confidence was at an all-time low as well. Thankfully, knowing that my grades will cmi, I did a lot of leadership and volunteer activities. When I was applying to SUTD, I knew my CCA and leadership activities definitely helped me get in.

Once I was in SUTD, I was learning at a slightly-slower-than-JC pace but with strong teacher support. Plus there was many hands-on projects that had a significant weightage in my grades rather than being written exam-heavy. This time my focus was on getting a job before graduation, and I had to figure this out mostly on my own and going nearly every month to my uni's career development centre. Accepted a job offer not long before COVID hit.

**My takeaways about the different education pathways**

My younger sibling in ITE was initially disappointed (as a SG kid would be) that they only had the option of ITE. However the teachers and facilities at ITE are seriously commendable. Heck, all the ITEs had better facilities than some JCs. ITE teachers are some of the most concerned teachers I've heard of from my sibling, who gained tons of self-confidence and now knows how to take care of themselves- go to gym, cook, compare online shopping prices (lol).

My polytechnic sibling never chose to go to poly due to their grades but had a good enough portfolio to go through a few jobs (some companies they worked at closed down or had poor office culture).

Both of them had more career experience than I did as part of their education, and to me, this was more important than what I see as just studying and revising for exams.

SG Society is so focused on academics and going to university that any other pathway is viewed as lesser. What's worse is that this view is held by and supported by many of our parents and teachers. Many of our elders are so adamant on this because they see it as a max benefit, min obstacles path. ""It is easier to get into uni from JC. It is easier to get a job with a degree"".

In my opinion, all of us are going to school so that we can get a job in the future. I don't think the education pathway you take should be your worth, although it shapes much of how you perceive society. ITE students can work after they grad, or go poly. Poly grads can work after they grad, or go uni. JC grads either retake their A levels, stick with their O level certs when finding work, or go uni. Ultimately, it's a test of grit and mindset.

Anyone who tries to convince you that going anywhere but JC and uni will be detrimental, is perpetuating a toxic stereotype that works against the raising up of all members of society (as cheesy as it sounds). Not everyone can afford the tuition and extracurriculars and connections to get into elite schools, but everyone has worth in society regardless of where they come from and where they were educated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ix2pyp/rant_jc_vs_poly_vs_ite_by_a_jc_grad/,True,2020-09-22 07:35:02

626,[O Levels] EAE interviews,"Alright for you guys,gals and non binary pals taking EAE interviews soon this is a expandable list that you can refer to to prep for your interviews 😉 feel free to add on questions in the comments 

-Why do you want to apply for this course

TIP: Reasearch about job prospects and modules you are looking forward to seeing in the course so that you are able to elaborate on them so the examiners know you have done your research about the course
Why: this is a basic question asked and the examiners are looking for your interests and characters in your answers 

-Tell me something about yourself that is not in the 600 word write up

TIP: say something related to the course e.g for engineering course say art and craft because you like to create things in your spare time
Why: to basically find out your interests and character and what you may be good at in the course

-Tell me a module you are looking forward to in your course 

TIP: Reasearch the course you are being interviewed for and pick 1 or 2 modules that look interesting and read a bit into them and make sure to elaborate 
E.g engineering course students can say thermofluids or calculus because they have read up on it and are looking forward to learning more about __________(<---insert main points of the module)
Why: to see if you have read up on the course and understand the basics of it

-If given a choice where would you intern for your final year

TIP: look for companies that your course are related to and potential places that you want to work
E.g accounting students can say PWC and elab that it is part of the big 4(deliotte,KPMG, PWC and ERNST and young). Flaunt your knowledge about the companies that you can intern in to make it look like you did your research 
Why: to see if you have planned ahead and what you look forward to in a job/internship 

-If given endless materials and knowledge what would you create (for those whose courses require creative thinking)

TIP: go nuts with this one just take note that you have endless materials and knowledge for this project 
Why: to see how you would think and what would you do when provided with free reign to do whatever you want with this project

-What is the future of _______(<---- insert job field that is specific to your course e.g accounting/engineering/healthcare etc)
TIP: Reasearch what is going on in the world to find out what is currently happening in those fields

-What would you do to a teammate if a teammate was uncooperative during groupwork?

TIP: just think back about past experiences with groupwork and you can say if the person continues to be uncooperative you can include the practice of peer evaluation for grading so the grades will be fair 
Why: test candidate to see how they would react to this common situation during groupworks cause it is common

-Are you worried that AI may take over your job?/ Do you think AI will take over your job?(for those who are not in engineering fields)

TIP: Yes and no are both correct answers  
Yes:AI able to do work very effectively and efficiently but _______(<----insert elaboration about AI unable to do certain human tasks in job you may end up with)
No:unable to add human touches to the work done 
Why:I'm not sure but I think its along the lines of thinking ahead 

-What would you do if you do not get accepted?

TIP: okay this question is honestly one of the hardest questions to answer cause it will definitely happen to some of you so answer honestly. You can say that you will continue to work hard for O's and try again for JAE or other courses. Just anything that shows that you will continue to work hard to get your course 
Why: they are looking for resilience in shortlisted people  so do your best to answer this like a human being and not like a answer like a bot

628,[uni] Why I’m choosing SMU Law,"A few people have messaged me on the thread and I thought this might be helpful so I just copy pasted stuff from the convo:
SMU is rly convenient for me because i have a straight bus there. 
The food in town is much cheaper+ better than nus law which is in bukit timah. And also, the quality of education isn’t compromised (which I feel like is a really important factor!) 
I think hall life is super great but frankly unnecessary. One of the reasons why people think it’s great is because it forces u to have higher involvement in ur school community + fosters interfaculty bonding, which happens in smu via the more exciting ccas! They also have greater community involvement w a lot of overseas opportunities 
Furthermore, welfare in smu is just so much better haha ... facilities are newer, and they have great funding for initiatives. I think the reason why I was initially apprehensive about going to SMU is because I thought the people there were noobs (LOL sry) and that they were not as ‘smart’ as NUS. But I think that really differs from cohort to cohort. 
Plus I think people from SMULaw are definitely more articulate than NUS because they’re trained in presentations and class part :-) I did take the whole class participation thing in smu into consideration, but I do think that it does help to have a more engaged class that understands concepts as compared to one that just takes down notes and studies, especially in the context of law. I actually think that SMU suits my learning style more because I could never ever pay attention in JC in either tutorial or lecture ... so a more engaging learning environment is definitely a big plus for me. 

While some may think the project work in modules are redundant, every uni has its pros and cons. I’m sure throughout ur life u also didn’t think every lecture u attended was important, so in this context, not every presentation/group work component will be ‘important’ or ‘useful’. 
Regarding the prestige between both law schools, I’ve been told that both smu and nus law grads are equally as likely to succeed in whatever field they’re in and that it just rly depends on the individual’s abilities, rather than the school they are from. 

These are my consolidated points for why SMU law is just as great of a sch as NUS! Feel free to discuss in the comments if u have any concerns.. I feel like there are no current smu law students on this thread LOL and this is just what I gathered after scouring the entire internet",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gjdxi8/uni_why_im_choosing_smu_law/,True,2020-05-14 18:57:26

630,[O Levels] Scoring Straight A1s for Secondary English and O Level English-- Paper 1 edition,"In this discourse today, i would like to share my tips and tricks on scoring well in O Level english paper 1. I have seen many posts about students struggling with english, and ultimately not scoring as well as expected in N/O levels just because of a low english grade.

As everyone knows, english is a compulsory subject taken into account in all grading systems -- EMB3, L1R4, L1R5, EL1B2R2 etc. Because of this, i just wanted to say that Cambridge will make the english paper accessible for everyone. Accessible, by no means easy, nor difficult. The paper is structured  in a way which helps to maximise students' grades for the subject itself.

**Paper 1**

1. **General Preparation Tips**

Firstly, I would like to emphasise a point that many often overlook. How many points have you lost due to carelessness, especially because of poor grammar? PLEASE CHECK YOUR WORK. The english paper 1 is structured in a way that gives you sufficient time to reread your essays to correct these mistakes. Minimising these mistakes can actually help you see an increase in grades.

Secondly, reading plays a huge, if not the biggest, part of paper 1 prep. The common question would be: "" what kind of content should i be consuming?"" Let's be real here. In secondary school, our schedules are often so packed with activities that we barely have time to sit down and indulge in some literary works. If you were to ask me, i don't think that i have read a single fiction book in the entirety of my upper secondary life. So storybooks are pretty much out of the question. Something that i find extremely helpful are the Beyond Horizons magazines. i'm not sure if these are ordered in all schools, but if you have the means to, the subscription is worth spending the money on. The magazine offers an array of content -- from day-to-day experiences and stories, to tips and tricks for writing, and even comprehension and editing exercises. They offer fantastic reads in each volume and can definitely help in writing. Reader's Digest is also excellent in the content they provide. The topics discussed definitely struck a chord with me, and in turn offered me inspiration to manifest my thoughts and opinions in my writing.  Apart from these two series, keeping up with current affairs is also paramount to aid with coming up with content and examples in writing.

Thirdly, vocabulary. Vomiting all the vocabulary that you know is useful ONLY IF you use the words aptly. Certain words have nuances that we often overlook, causing the word to be inappropriately used in a certain situation, resulting in deduction of points due to 'WW' -- 'Wrong Word'. I personally don't have the superb power to come out with an unbelievably touching story or discussion that will move the marker to tears. Hence i depended on vocabulary a lot. I was so desperate to use as much vocab as possible in my writing, that i compiled a huge list of vocab words and their meanings, and crammed my brain with as many as possible for me to use in my writing. Learning vocabulary depends on how much effort you are willing to put in OVER TIME . It cannot be done a week before the english exam. So, if you are preparing for O/N Levels 2020, PLEASE START NOW. 

2.  **Editing**

The easiest section of the entire english paper. It's basically a free 10 mark section. The tricks are simple -- identify the keywords that will help you determine the faulty parts of the sentence. Setters always like to hide the mistakes at the end of a line, or the beginning of a line. Read well. The mistakes are not as difficult to spot once you have a grip of what's going on in the passage. That being said, do NOT rush into circling the mistakes immediately. Go through the passage once first, identify if it is in past, present or future tense, then proceed with attempting the questions. Nothing much to be said about editing, just be very careful as to not make careless mistakes. 

3. **Situational Writing**

Be very clear about the formats. Commit the differences in formal vs informal, email vs letter, news article, speech, to memory. You do not want to lose any marks because of wrong format. Next, annotate the question given. Take note of your Purpose, Audience and Context. These are all defining factors on how you should sculpt your writing. Make sure that you are clear of the question requirements. Break the requirements down, assigning them a paragraph each. After writing, make sure that your piece has met all the requirements (task fulfilment). One thing that many struggle with is keeping the tone. While writing, you have to consciously remind yourself to take note of the tone of your writing. If you are writing to a senior teacher, for instance, be very aware of the level of his/her seniority and sculpt your piece carefully. One more thing -- DO NOT SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THIS SECTION OF THE PAPER. Only give yourself 45 minutes, capped at 50. You need much more time to plan your essay, so do not dwell on situational writing for too long. 

4. **Essay writing**

My favourite part of english. To begin, if you have ever been told to just focus on the style you're good at, please throw that advice out of the window right away. Cambridge is unpredictable. You could be fantastic at writing expository essays, but all it takes is one difficult and abstract topic to come out and you could be screwed over right away. Hence it is important to be versatile in your writing skills. While it is important to hone your skills in expository essays as they are more likely to be applicable in the future, it is equally important to be well-versed in the skills of writing descriptive, personal reflection and recount essays. The first step to attempting an essay of sorts is to come out with a detailed plan. Underline keywords, identify the important bits of the question, find out how you should elaborate on each content paragraph. Planning is an important step that many often overlook as they find it unnecessary. Having a plan will give you a clear idea of which direction to steer your story in. 

I will further break essay writing down into 2 parts, namely expository writing and narrative essays. 

For expository writing, start off by making the marker want to read your story. Make it intriguing. Draw the reader in and capture their attention from the very start. Personally, i am more well versed in descriptive writing, but i enjoy writing expository essays more. Hence, I often start off my expository essays with an anecdote. An anecdote is a short story, or an episode. By drawing in a personal example of your own, or creating a short but intriguing story, you will be able to effectively interest the reader right from the start. You can also start off with a hook, a quote, or a popular saying -- there are a multitude of story starters you could use. In your planning step for expository essays, you must prepare your points for your content paragraphs. This way, you can expound on each point once you reach that paragraph, facilitating a smoother thought process and flow in your writing. In a discursive essay, you should ideally have about 3-4 content paragraphs, while in an argumentative piece, you can have 2-3 points which are 'for' the statement, and one content paragraph for a rebuttal. I will not delve into how to write each paragraph. However, what i would like to touch on is the usage of examples in expository essays. Whatever you do, DO NOT USE THEORETICAL EXAMPLES. An example of a theoretical example is ""If a man uphold his rights and beliefs..."" Do not do this. Always have fresh and upcoming examples at the tips of your fingers. This is where the importance of reading comes in handy. You do not need to memorise statistics, but you need to provide a clear explanation which showcases your understanding of the example you have raised. At the very end of your essay, remember to balance out your points and give a conclusion that does not specifically point to one view, but instead sums up the points in the essay and give an equal weightage to each of the points raised in the content paragraphs. 

Most of the time, students avoid narrative essays. Personally, I would also choose to write an expository essay over a narrative essay. However, narrative essays reduce the likelihood of writing off-topic, which can cost you many marks. There is much less to unpack in a narrative essay question, as they usually ask you to ""write about a time..."", which involves some personal experiences to be brought in. It is easier to hit the content marks for narrative essays, so long as you meet the question requirements. However, in order to write a good narrative essay, lots of description has to be brought in. Think 5W1H. Producing a good narrative essay piece that 1) isn't too boring and 2) doesn't sound like a primary schooler's essay can be challenging. This is also where a good command of vocabulary comes in handy. To be able to visualise the scenario you are writing about is also paramount in ensuring that the reader gets the clearest idea that you are trying to bring across. When writing an essay on personal recount or personal reflection, remembering to bring across your feelings will help express the story better, making it less dry and unappetising. Keywords in narrative essay questions are also extremely important. Students must be aware if the question is asking for one instance, or for multiple episodes. Many students often miss this out, resulting in undesired content marks. Remember to conclude the story well and do not leave it hanging. 

That's about it for paper 1 english! feel free to ask any more questions that you have i will try my best to answer as soon as possible!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ftn613/o_levels_scoring_straight_a1s_for_secondary/,True,2020-04-03 06:21:35

633,[Rant] being emotionally unavailable,"I'm considered the funny, cheerful kind of person in my class. But I have something I struggle with a lot and I'm scared that it would affect my future relationships too: the fact that I don't emotionally get invested in any form of relationship & also am not good at comforting others (overall just giving support emotionally).

I obviously love and cherish my friends and would do anything for them, but emotionally I just can't click that part of my brain that would say ""these ppl are precious to you"". It feels like I only acknowledge them as important people in my life, but I can't FEEL that acknowledgement?? I can't describe it in words but its as if I'm only looking at relationships logically rather than also emotionally. I can't give that emotional investment.

This brings me to my next point- because of this, im really bad at providing my friends with emotional support. I instinctively search for a solution to their problem rather than telling them it will all be alright and giving them comforting words? Whenever something bad or sad happens and I have to provide some support I would have to Google "" how to say ___ to ____"" like its not even from my own heart!! For example when I was walking to school with my friend, she told me (smtg bad that happened to her) and I actually couldn't even say anything. Not because I was shocked for her, but because I was thinking of what to say appropriately instead. I really feel bad for her but I can't translate that properly and instead of comforting her I was thinking about how I should respond appropriately (but I just kept quiet and we kept walking which made it feel even worse).

I don't know what's wrong with me?? I wonder if its because my family (divorce) is independent of each other, so I also don't really have much of an emotional connection with my siblings and I never really grew up in an environment where emotions were considered? Or is it because I automatically distrust others that I can't be emotionally invested (a very troubling childhood so lol)?? 

I'm scared that this sort of lack of attachment I feel towards others will affect my relationships in the future. I genuinely don't know what to do, especially since my future career path is centered around support and emotions.. hais",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/keed9a/rant_being_emotionally_unavailable/,True,2020-12-17 10:08:52

635,[Uni][Rant] Hall life is depressing,"Being cut from so many CCAs is depressing. Seeing everyone else so tight with their level/og mates while I'm here eating alone in my room everyday is depressing. Knowing that I can't blame anyone but myself for feeling like this is depressing. When people open-jio in the level/block chats for meals, I don't even dare to go join them, because I'm afraid they'll just be all 'who's this dude I've never seen him before' and everything will be awkward. I'm always gonna be that random extra dude. People just kinda look away when they see me instead of saying hi. It's gotten to the point where I'll starve myself and eat really late so the chances of me bumping into someone I know when I dabao lunch/dinner is lower. I thought I joined hall to crawl out of my shell and change myself, but I never did. I don't know what stopped me but I didn't want to be the one taking the initiative. So I waited for people to reach out to me instead. And some did, but they all have their own cliques now. I couldn't really slot myself into any of them, I guess I'm not interesting enough.

636,[JC] To go or to not go for Orientation,"This probably sounds stupid to most but I'm really introverted and just am not the most enthusiastic when it comes to ice-breaker type games, mass dances or any social activities; I also did not make friends in sec school during the orientation period, but rather just throughout the school year. 

Heard that you have to wear your sec school uni and for the first time in my life, I'm scared of people judging because I come from a shitty school.

But I heard that you have to choose your subject combis on the 1st day of school? Is this true and if so, can I skip the rest of the orientation days? 

Do JCs even allow parents' letter (bc this one JC's website I looked at said only MCs are allowed or something) ?

Can anyone who has the same social ineptitude share some advice lol? I've been worried about this for a few days now. Again, I know it's a trivial issue but I can't help but panic.

646,[Rant] feeling left out,"Im usually a lurker in this sub but i’ve wanted to post about this for quite a while:

I have this kinda loose group of friends, maybe 5-10 ppl, & honestly i’ve never really felt close to anyone. I drifted between different groups of ppl bc I just didn’t feel close with them. At the very least I try to interact and be friendly, but its either that the group doesn’t accept me or it kinda forcefully include me in their convos . 

Whats worse is that I thought i had friends but I’m probably not interactive enough? Our big group used to have a group chat but I recently heard that they made a new one ; they never text in our old gc anyway. They share their notes and gossip and other stuff, and often pm each other too. Maybe im not reaching out enough? I barely use my phone to text. When we are talking its almost like they already knew what to talk about beforehand. We have contrasting interests. I like gaming and yt while they like tiktok so we barely have anything to discuss anyway. 

Since its exam season they often ask each other for help and ask questions. But i dont really have that network of support, bc my parents are overworked, which left me feeling exhausted. Meanwhile in class I see my friend group texting each other math questions etc.

When we discuss about our opinions and I voice out mine, sometimes Im told that its irrelevant, particularly by 1/ 2 outspoken people. Honestly it turned from a civil discussion to just them asserting dominance. It left me feeling kind of disturbed by how easy it is to be fake nice to others.

This is probably just a natural feeling. Anyone has had the same problem or is it just my FOMO? Got any advice ? I should just reach out more right...",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j92oan/rant_feeling_left_out/,True,2020-10-12 01:47:16

648,[A LEVELS] my thoughts after 1 week of papers,"After every paper I would open up Reddit and view the megathreads and honestly, it warms my heart to see people just encouraging and pushing each other to press on.

They all like to say What was done, is done. But I think many of us can agree that it is difficult to easily accept it without worrying about what we will see on our result slips.

I like to share about how I calm myself down after facing a paper that I have 0 confidence in:
I think about what I will be doing at 25 YO - looking back at the time I went through hellish nights completing PW WR and sleepless nights with empty thoughts like ""what if I need to retake, what if my results are trash, what if I can't get into uni"" - and laughing about it. 

It's similar to how we will go through hell and then come out stronger and think that ""hey, actually it's not that bad"", I know it will be alright after it's over.
Although it is big for me to say this since I'm still in the midst of A levels just like everyone else, life is so much more exciting and filled it fulfilling stuff that is totally NOT governed by the results of our A levels. Sure we all want to do well, but think about how much impact our result will REALLY do in 10 years time. Big dreams comes with resilience. Regardless of the results, the resilience you showed after doing your best in every single paper is what will make you a better person, not your actual results. 

This really calms me down and I hope it works for you too!

649,[A LEVELS] H2 Biology Practical FINAL TIPS,"Hi guys \~\~\~

To everyone taking the H2 Bio prac on Thursday all the best!!! Here's some points that you should know by the end of tomorrow to do well and I'm just listing them out as a self-reminder as well :)

**Biological drawings**

* Size (at least 2/3 of given space)
* Proportion (correct ratio of dimensions of each part)
* Line (sharp and continuous; erase all stray marks!)
* Title
* Revise the basic components of a plant cell and plant tissues (diffierentiate a plan & cell diagram!)

**Common plant tissues**

* Root (Epidermis, cortex, xylem, phloem, cambium, vascular bundle)
* Stem (Epidermis, cortex, pith, xylem, phloem, cambium, vascular budle)
* Leaf (Uppder epidermis, waxy cuticle, palisade mesophyll, spongy mesophyll, xylem, phloem, vascular bundle, guard cell, stoma, lower epidermis)

*(The common diagrams are good to know. But remember to always DRAW WHAT YOU SEE, even if it is different from what you are used to.)*

**Graph**

* No awkward scales
* Title (if required by question)
* Correct axes with units
* Check question for LINE or CURVE of best fit
* DO NOT EXTRAPOLATE *(even if its tempting to connect the graph to origin when you shouldn't)*

**Measurements**

* Read and record to 1/2 of smallest division of instrument (unless instructed otherwise; e.g. ""if the colour does not change after 10 minutes, record 'no observable change' "" <--- follow this strictly!)
* Average values follow d.p. of raw data
* Processed data take on s.f. of least precise raw data

**Microscopy**

|Objective lens|Actual magnification|Number of stage micrometer divisions|Number of divisions on eyepiece graticule that this coincides with|Length of each eyepiece graticule division|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|x4|x40|10|40|25.0  μm|
|x10|x100|5|50|10.0  μm|
|x40|x400|2|80|2.5  μm|

**Theory questions**

Study the common questions tested that require *content knowledge from the H2 syllabus*. Here is a list of some of them.

* Rate of enzyme activity when change in factors, including enzyme conc, substrate conc, temperature, pH, presence of competitive / non-competitive / allosteric inhibitors
   * Keywords : Frequency of effective collision, rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation, active site, complementary in shape and charge, denaturation, disruption of R-group interactions that stabilised 3D tertiary conformation of enzyme active site
* Rate of photosynthesis when change in factors, including light intensity, CO2 conc, temperature
   * Keywords : Photoactivation, resonance transfer of energy, electron hole, photolysis resulting in production of O2, carbon fixation
* Rate of respiration when change in factors, including temperature, glucose conc, O2 conc
   * Keywords : Oxidative phosphorylation, H+ gradient across inner mitochondrial membrane, proton-motive force, chemiosmosis, O2 as final electron acceptor
* Biomolecules + test for presence (may be asked to describe)

**Common data processing and experimental understanding questions**

Q: Possible limitations of the procedure

A: Inaccurate and subjective judgement of colour change by the human eye (if identifying colour change is involved like Benedict's test or DCPIP) / Small sample size resulting in high percentage error / Lack of control / Lack of repeats and replicates

Q: Count the number of cells in the microscope field of view undre x40 objective lens.

A: Record 3 counts and take average!

Q: Purpose of conducting a pilot test

A: To be familiair with when end-point is reached so this can be used as a standard for subsequent tests

Q: Simple dilution VS serial dilution

A: Simple dilution is more accurate since error in early dilutions will not be carried forwards.

**Planning**

Aim - Copy from question; Otherwise ""To investigate how \[independent variable\] affects \[dependent variable\]

Theory - People tend to over-write but this section is only worth 1-2 marks and there are usually many possible mark points so don't waste too much time on this\~\~

Variables - Independent + Range; Dependent; Measurable + How to convert from measurable to dependent; Constant + Why constant + How to keep constant

Procedures - Pilot test, annotated diagram (if the set-up is rather complicated), control, replicates and repeats

Data processing - Table with appropriate headings (REMEMBER to record ""replicate 1"", ""replicate 2"", ""replicate 3"" and ""average"") + Graph if necessary + How to address aim with the collected data

Risks and precautions - Identify potential danger + How you prevent them

\**Common risks and precautions*

1. Hot water, so use rags to hold container to prevent scalding (when water bath is needed)
2. Sharp items, so place them on non-slip surfaces to prevent accidents (when cutting of plant / animal specimens is required)
3. Reagent may be an irritant / allergen (literally can be said for ANY reagent except distilled water, like enzyme solutions, H2O2, DCPIP etc.), so wear safety goggles and gloves to prevent contact with eyes and skin
4. Use of ethanol / alcohol (for dissolving of cell membranes), so ensure no naked flame nearby to prevent catching fire
5. Use of electrical applicances (e.g. colorimeter, spectrophotometer, bench lamp, centrifuge, blender etc.), so operate with dry hands to prevent electrocution

*\*Note the common volumes of containers and take care to not exceed them.*

* Max capacity of spectrophotometer cuvette ==> 1cm^(3); use a micropipette
* Max capacity of petri dish ==> 90cm^(3), but keep to 50cm^(3)

*\*Always state the instrument & volume of instrument used in procedure. Be specific.*

e.g. Use a clean 5.0cm^(3) syringe, transfer 3.0cm^(3) of protease solution into a boiling tube.

&#x200B;

That's it for now! Do suggest below for other important things to note and any predictions for the paper HAHAHAHA

**Items to bring:**

Entry proof

Photo ID / Passport

Pen

Pencil

Eraser

Ruler

Compass (just in case you need to draw round cells and you can't draw them freehand like me)

Calculator

Notes to study (if your shift allows you to)

651,[Rant] perfectionism and high expectations of myself,"in theory, school can be very enjoyable. i learn new, interesting stuff every day, i get to have fun with my friends, i have teachers i can treat as friends and even joke along with. furthermore, the school always stress exams are not important, so technically, i don't even have to stress about it!

well yeah... no. we all know this is but an idealistic dream maybe only the very lucky 1% can even think of experiencing. 

personally, school has always been a place of fear --- i cried every single day for the first few months of primary 1 (yes, primary 1). as a child, things were just never normal; my parents faced a messy divorce when i was still in kindergarten. this shattered the mirage little me had that i was living in a fairytale. it showed me from a young age that life wasn't like the upbeat television shows i used to watch. no, life was crappier than that.

and so that was the worldview i carried for the next few years of my life. my parents never cared about my academics; not once have my parents asked me for my grade, let alone praise me for doing well in school. as such, i've learnt that i only have myself to depend on. ive become my own parent, my own teacher, my own mentor. the crippling expectations that others receive from their family, i receive from myself. perhaps it is due to my imperfect childhood that i refuse to let anything else taint my fairytale. if my family is imperfect, then everything else has to be perfect. and to us Singaporeans, ""everything else"" just means our school life.

so yes, through many silent breakdowns and tears, i managed to push through my socioeconomic status, and despite not having any tuition or help or expectations from my family, i have achieved what society considers academic success. the journey here has been, if i do say so myself, an extremely tough one. disappointment hits you harder when it's your own expectations that you're failing. disappointment hits you harder when you feel like everyone else is against you succeeding, and you have just failed the only person that had hope in you (you). i may have succeeded (for now), but at what cost? i used to have such grand aspirations and dreams for the future but now i slave away watching lectures and attending tutorials for subjects i know i just won't care about 10 years down the road. and for what? for the standard definition of success, for the standard definition of perfection. i could be exhausted, disillusioned and unmotivated the whole term, but once exam period strikes, i immediately switch on and turn into a studying robot programmed to serve the education system. i know this is not what i want --- but nothing can change, because i just want perfection, and perfection means this.

not just academic success, i also feel like i have to be the most well-liked by everyone, to have the most enriching social life. although i became selectively mute after the events of my childhood and suffered from severe social anxiety, i tried to ""cure"" myself the best i could by watching YouTube videos and many of that sorts. of course, social perfection can't be achieved, and so yet again i get disappointed. so i work harder again, but then i realise this perfection isnt possible, then i get disappointed; the cycle repeats.

i'm tired. after 17 years of chasing perfection, i'm simply, exhausted. and yet i keep going; i'm too far in and my legs keep running, even though my mind just wants me to abandon this race.

i'm sorry for all the ramble. i'm sorry if i sound detached or aloof. i'm just not used to telling anyone about my struggles, because if my parents aren't even concerned for me, then who will be?

i'm sorry, i just needed somewhere to rant. i know others have it worse than me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hzeuwx/rant_perfectionism_and_high_expectations_of_myself/,True,2020-07-29 05:42:00
652,[Rant] [O Levels] Dear Procrastination,"edit: oh my goodness, i didn't know this would receive so much traffic- thank you all for the kind comments and your help! i appreciate it very much <3

dear procrastination,

thank you for trapping me in a vicious cycle of trying to catch up with everyone else.

thank you for plaguing me with the knowledge that if only i hadn't listened to you, i could have done better.

thank you for making me doubt my place in a class full of intelligent, hardworking people.

thank you for hindering my attempts at improving in weaker subjects.

thank you for the late nights filled with tears, regrets, and promises to never put myself through something similar ever again.

thank you for making sure those promises are never fulfilled.

~~~~~

i'm staring at the question paper before me and i immediately feel sick.

formulas that come easily to my classmates end up becoming muddled, twisted and confused in my own mind.

didn't i study for this topic?

why can't i remember anything?

everyone around me is already scribbling their answers down, their pens flying across their papers as their fingers furiously tap out equations on their calculators.

i feel dizzy.

my vision is blurring with tears that threaten to fall.

~~~~~

sorry for the weird rant, it's just that e math's been stressing me out lately :')

it has always been my weakest subject and right now it's the main thing that's threatening my plans to get accepted into the polytechnic course that i want

for context, i'm in the ""smart"" class of my school. our teachers don't say it outright but we've always been held at a higher standard compared to other classes. unsurprisingly, my classmates do extremely well, especially in e math. it's very common to see people score 90+ for tests and practice papers.

i don't take a math, which makes me part of a very small percentage of students who take something other than that subject, so already i feel like i'm somewhat at a disadvantage when it comes to e math.

lately, i've been trying so hard to bring my e math grades up, especially because of the aforementioned poly situation. i like to think that i'm making progress; i scored full marks for a quiz recently. but no matter how hard i try, i just can't wrap my head around certain topics.

i feel embarrassed to ask for help because of how good everyone else is at e math; i'm honestly probably the weakest in class when it comes to the subject. my parents can't help me either, and i feel so bad that they're potentially wasting money on a hopeless case (i'm not a citizen).

i just feel so trapped, honestly. and it sounds stupid because i'm 100% to blame for the situation that i'm in right now.

i'm tired of feeling like my best will never be enough.

656,"[O Levels] English sucks, Poly or JC?"," 

Hi guys, going to collect O levels results soon and I'm very stressed about going to poly or JC.

I mainly want to go JC because I like the JC lifestyle and I perform much better in theory than compared to projects and stuff. Additionally I really love mathematics and going to JC to take Further math is also one way to allow me to study math in depth. But one thing fears me in JC is general paper and on top of that my English sucks.

In contrary, going to poly would not be something I like as the lifestyle is way too free and easy and I'm not a fan of doing many projects. Also, in poly, we all have to rely on the laptop for our notes, projects and assignments, I do not really like it as I am more of a pen and paper guy. However, poly also allows me to study math as long as I enroll into the school of engineering and I need not fear about the general paper.

Sorry for this long post but I really need a balanced view or opinion from you guys about selecting my tertiary education in a few weeks time. Feel free to correct me if I have any misunderstandings about JC and poly in the post I have written.

657,[A Level] The Final Lap,"As O Levels draw to a close ~~and having read many of the complaints about the papers~~, it's almost our turn. In fact, in two days it'll be GP (and KI P1 if you take KI)  :0

I just wanna tell you guys that:

\- you've worked hard and you've come so far, so don't let panic mode screw up all of that on d-day (as is the wise words of my H2 econs teacher)

\- pls don't forget to rest!! sleep deprivation is scary and esp so during national exams :(

\- but also it's roughly 1 month to the last paper before everyone's done! (slightly more if you take h3 subjects) it'll fly by before you even realise it XD

\- and finally, atb to everyone!! memorise whatever essays/answer points/ equations etc etc that y'all need but also stay hydrated and healthy!!!!!! drink ur dihydrogen monoxide pl0x (just dont er end up having to go toilet during exam LMAO)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jkq1st/a_level_the_final_lap/,True,2020-10-30 20:13:19
658,[rant] It is ok!,"This is for everyone I just dk which flair to put in so I put in rant and this isn't a rant. Over the past few wks, we can all see panic posts, ppl being very stressed, ppl having doubts on themselves and some those who just cannot tahan these exams and sch anymore. It is ok I understand! This is just a motivation post.

Firstly, **for those who are taking their exams now**, I wanna say its ok to feel like you have not done enough. It is ok if you feel unprepared. It is part of the process. Ik with olvls and alvls and all your parent's expectations, teachers expectations and peers expectations, u will feel the pressure to meet it and hence be stressed. But what I wanna say is when you are doing the exam do it for yourself. Don think abt what others will think of you! (ik its easier said than done) It's ok to feel like you are going to fail everything but pls pls all I wanna say is don't let that negativity get to you! It is not going to do anything gd. It will just harm your mentality. Have a positive mind when going to the exam and have written it in a positive mindset. Ik yall will now say what if the ppr is hard and I really cannot do it anymore? As I wrote the olvl last yr, I actl found some geog and SS qns hard ( let me tell u ALWAYS get C6 for combined humans) but I **DID NOT LET IT BRING ME DOWN**!! I kept my cool and didn't spiral and continues writing the exams and I got a B3!! **One tip** (my teacher told me this):  bfr entering the exam hall or even the night before, imagine you doing the ppr and the ppr being so easy that you finish it like a breeze! This has helped me many times bfr but sometimes I just didn't study much so I screwed up:((

Now, **for those who have finished their exams and got their results and aren't satisfied** (ppl like me), I wanna say it is ok! Ik u might feel like you have let many ppl down and many ppl are disappointed in you but when you compare the grand scale of your entire life this particular exam is nothing. Ik many say this but it is hard to think abt it that way(me too). **Life is like a circle, when it goes down, IT WILL GO UP!** Ik one of the most common feeling is ' i put in so much effort but still can't score well!' I have felt this many many times and even broke down becoz of this. But rmbr those you did not reap what you sow this time round, the characteristic of being **hardworking will benefit you one day in the future.** Look back at your mistakes and try to change it and correct it. Need tuition, go for tuition! Need teacher's remarks, go for consults! Wtv is it you do, **always fight back**! **One day, you will reap what you sow.** **U have to have a break down to have a breakthrough!** 

My own experience: Since sec 3, I will finish all my hw do all the extra worksheet my teacher gave me and I always scrape thru. My parents put me in tuition and yes I started to improve but I wasn't satisfied. The lowest point in my sec sch life was sec 3 SA1 where I failed 3/8 subjects and my parents scolded me so badly and I cried and cried and cried (I was literally the worst student in my class). I was on the verge of giving up but gd thing my friends arnd me consoled me and motivated me and continued on and the sec 3 nov-dec hols I did tys and everything possible and in sec 4 ptm, my teachers all said I improved a lot (which I did as I passed all sub and some of them were As also) Fast forward to Olvl, I didn't do as well as I expected but I didn't do as badly as I did in sec 3 and I could enter ACJC.

And, **for those who say they just cant study or have been procrastinating a lot,** it is ok! If you feel like u wasted this opportunity, never mind! **Life will always give you second chances** (maybe not in the same form but there will opportunity in other forms and its might harder to get but it is still out there). Learn from your mistakes now and prevent from making them in the future! **Use your past mistakes to push you up and not pull u down!**

In conclusion, I know studies take a significant part of our lives and it can take a toll on our mental health. **If yall wanna rant, my DMs are always open!**

**Mistakes, when you look back will always make us a better person and not make us worse off! Failures are not the opposite of success, it is part of success!** All the best for everyone for their exams! And those who are now having holidays, make good use of your holidays and don't forget to enjoy at the same time!

661,[rant] not really a rant but—,"hello again fellow reddit procrastinators! (i'm joking pls don't axe me 😳)

as the title states this isn't actually a rant but it felt like the most suitable flair for this post. basically it dawned on me that i probably really need genuine help with sleeping, and for reference it's currently 1am and i have pure bio paper 1 later in the day. 1am is no biggie to me or my screwed up body clock, and there's more than enough time for me to sleep, but i just can't stop thinking about the ""could've""s, ""should've""s, ""would've""s, but didn't. as a result, i feel like i'm spiralling deeper into this abyss of sleep deprivation (which unfortunately, i'm no stranger to) and i have a terrible sense of foreboding that it's only going to get worse after o levels because i'd be pointlessly worrying (again, no stranger to that either) over things that i can't change.

typing to this point made me realise that this post has probably turned into a rant already but any (economically friendly, no professional help involved) ways that you use to cope would be really helpful 😔

662,"[O LEVELS] To those of you who are feeling demoralised, demotivated","hi! thought i'd share my input here because i saw some of you here feeling distressed over ur o levels. it's really ok to feel this way (i mean theres such posts every year during exam season, and i myself start to get anxious too haha)

came from a neighbourhood school with cop of 188.
subj combi: el, amath, emath, pure phy, pure chem, hcl, pure geog, ss+hist (dun even know why i chose to take pure sciences. twas a disaster) 

sec 4 results took a hit, with my 1se having a C for my comb hum and C for my EL prelims. i rmb i was panicking, feeling extremely demoralised. but i didnt wanna give up just like that, bc ik i wont settle for a C at all. the process was extremely draining, with me spending whatever free time i had to do my practices or revise, and then going for consultations with teachers (they got sick & tired of my face LOL) almost every day. 

i rmb when the o level period started, or rather the day before o levels, i couldnt sleep cuz i was so worried (but tip is rly not to burn the midnight oil, bc u really need the energy to concentrate during exams - scientifically proven that ur memory retention level drops as u try to study during midnight, which is the period of time for ur fried brains). but i was like screw it. i prepared for it. jus gonna give it my all.

first few days were fine, until chem & geog were on the same day (actually practicals ady got me crying oof cuz i screwed it up so badly). it was really r i p for me lol. i broke down, but i rmb someone told me that its rly pointless to cry over spilt milk at that point in time. 

so really, whats done is ady done. u cant undo the mistakes that u may have made in ur prev papers. in fact, applaud urself or give urself a pat on the back for pushing urself thru this far. you gave your very best. you prepared for it. you didnt give up on yourself despite the tough conditions that you were put in. you are absolutely resilient and motivated.

keep up with that good work, and im sure that determined attitude will encourage you to finish this final race. your friends talking about bellcurve, discussing answers after the papers - all these only induce anxiety and worry in you. you cant stop them, but that doesnt give you the excuse to stop yourself from trying even harder.

no matter what the outcome is, be it tears of joy b/c your efforts have been paid off, or tears of disappointment b/c u felt as if everything went wrong despite trying different ways/methods to help yourself jump through the last hurdle,

at least you did it. no matter which corner of singapore you're at, i want to tell you that im so proud of you. ur results ultimately dont define you. yes, competition is inevitable. achieving good grades seem to be everything, otherwise you'll think as if ur future is ruined. but no, you didnt fail as a person. in fact, you have succeeded in accomplishing this milestone in your life / education journey.

so, dear 2020 batch of sec 4s. ik this year has been exceptionally tough due to the covid-19 disrupting ur learning, but each and everyone of you will also be able to prove that yall can be more motivated and resilient than ever despite having to face with a pandemic.

all the best! and if you need any help for ss/hist, feel free to pm me :) scored an a1 for it :p

ps scored l1r5: 9-2 and unexpectedly went to nyjc arts stream :') nothing is impossible yea! take care of urself at the same time and dont overwork/burn urself out. sleep early and declutter ur thoughts :)

664,[O Levels] Motivation,"Hey y'all! So, O levels is kinda around the corner, and I wanna say things may be tough, but pleaseeeeeeeee just hold on! I know some things are just extremely tough right now, but I'm confident that u guys can do it!

I'm not fully aware of any of ur situations right now, so I can't really give very definite advice. However, I just wanna drop u guys quotes and stuff.

1) ""When you hit rock bottom, rock bottom can also be a great foundation on which to build and on which to grow.""

Times can get really tough. I know of people who just can't seem to do well and score rlly bad, I know of people who face certain family situations. However, I just wanna say that it's important to keep your mindset strong. You see, in my opinion, our minds were meant to BREAK US. Yes, I said it. Our minds tell us negative things like ""you can't do it"" or ""you're worthless"". 

I'm sure many of us have faced these kind of thoughts. However, it's always important to centre your thoughts on the main goal in front of you. Our minds were MADE to break us, BUT that doesn't necessarily mean that it's a bad thing. 

For example, if you go to a gym and lift weights, they would seem heavy at first, but as you grow, they would become less and less heavy. It's the same for our minds. Our minds tell us negative things to condition us to become stronger. So I know, things may be really tough, but hey, ""tough times don't last but tough people do"".

&#x200B;

2) ""No point crying over spilt milk.""

I'm sure many of us are ranting over how we could've done better for certain things. Yes, I'm talking about things like science practicals and all that. However, I want u to know that these praticals are not the end of the world.

Yes, the percentage may be quite high for a certain component of a test, but remember, a test has different components, and there's a reason for these different components. It's because they want to test the variety of skills such as understanding and physical applications of your understanding. 

I never worry over tests that I've already done NOT BECAUSE I'm good at them. Yes, I may score well for certain subjects but for some subjects my results are plainly shit. (LIKE HISTORY SKSKSKS) But I want you to know that I don't worry over them because I'm surprisingly calm. And when I say calm, I mean the kind of ""Ah it's done"". 

I know, not everyone can achieve this level of calm, but hey, it really is done. You can't change it. BUT!!!! BUT BUT YOU CAN CHANGE THE FUTURE. There are still more tests to do, and YOU can do well for them. Leave the doubts and regrets behind and keep climbing the mountain! The scenery is always nice at the peak. :>

&#x200B;

3) ""Believe you can, and you're halfway there.""

I know, this may seem like a very superficial quote, but honestly it's more true than you think. As I said before, the mindset that you carry with you is very important. Worrying too much can be very detrimental to your health, and that won't do good for you because you either burn out earlier or peak too early and not during O Levels.  

Keep yourself at a steady pace, drink lots of water, and don't study for like 6 hours at a shot. Section out your time, and have breaks in between. Don't play games during these breaks but instead do things like looking at pets or going for walks or doing sports.

&#x200B;

I hope all of these give y'all some kind of motivation, so keep going yeh dun give up! Stay strong and healthy, and always rest well! Keep striving for the best, for the best is yet to come.

Sincerely,

u/djmaybenot",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j8juzx/o_levels_motivation/,True,2020-10-11 04:45:45
665,[RANT] i’m not going to school even though i have o levels in a month time,"yes. as u would have read from the title, im not going to school even though ik that i have o’s coming up next month. i’ve been like this since this year and i can’t seem to buck myself up to attend school. due to several reasons that happened to me in school, i have gotten sick n tired of school. i have gone to see a psychologist and my school counsellor but nothing seem to help me. i know i should just ignore about what other people say and their thoughts about me but my brain is telling me not to and im super sensitive about it. recently, i tried to bring myself to school but all those thoughts kept me up till 2 am every night. when its the time for me to wake up, i just ignore my alarm and continue to sleep till 11am/12pm (sometimes even worse: 2/3pm).

luckily ive been studying at home but i would like to seek advice from u all about this situation and how to go back to school without thinking too much about how others look at me.

your advice will help me a lot and thanks.

667,[O Levels] Study tips that work,"Hi! I am am a J1 and I’ve been seeing an influx of posts regarding the O’s and I want to share study tips which have helped me attain my ideal score.

 1. Restrict your online activities. I have pretty bad self control and I get distracted by my phone quite often. I knew this was a problem and I had to combat it. So, I disabled my social media accounts, youtube, reddit etc. Basically, I blocked all distractions and when I wanted entertainment, I read the news. (Ya I know it seems drastic and terribly boring but it isn’t that bad once you’ve accustomed yourself to it) Basically, what you’re doing is having a dopamine detox. I don’t want to go into detail here, but in summary, we derive dopamine from instant gratification from social media, watching online entertainment etc. That isn’t necessarily a bad thing but your brain can become desensitized and you’ll crave for more and more dopamine leading to self-destructive habits that I am sure some of us are familiar with.

2. Keep on practicing. Re-reading your notes isn’t an effective way to study. If you need to memorise content you should actively recall what you have read. Active recall is scientifically proven to be one of the most (or the most) effective way of studying. What I mean is to try to recall the content you have to memorise without looking at your notes and keep repeating the process until you have familiarised yourself with the content. Alternatively, just keep doing your TYS. I did my TYS on notebooks so that I could do the questions more than once. I highlighted the questions I didn’t understand in my notebooks and sought help from my teachers through consultations. I took pure bio and chem and there are things to memorise. So whenever I came across something I had to memorise when I did practice questions, I highlighted that question and copied
down the model answer. I’ll then try to memorise the answer and review it again the next time I study. (TAKE NOTE!!! that the TYS answers aren’t always that accurate so you should ask your teachers for help when you see something odd)

3. Make use of your study break and DO NOT slack before your MCQ papers. Come on, by then it would already be the last stretch and you’ll have upwards of 2 months to chill. So, just keep working hard. Again, here’s where doing my MCQs on my notebooks helped. Because I intentionally left my TYS relatively clean the first time I did it, I could redo it completely. You should know that some questions are repeated so redoing the TYS before your MCQ papers really helps. 

4. Before the actual paper, DO NOT panic. Try not to congregate with your group of friends and try to keep calm. Panic is infectious lol. You can talk all you want after the paper! Do not feel dejected after a tough paper because there are other subjects to pull your score up. 

5. The night before your papers, get sufficient sleep. I CANNOT stress this enough. When you’re tired you just can’t perform as well as when you are alert. Even now, when you’re prepping for your exams, get sufficient sleep. Sleep is important for the consolidation of memory.

All the best :> I want to add that you can ask me about subjects, I’ll try to answer to the best of my ability though I cannot assure prompt responses because I should really be studying rn HAHA. I took pure bio, chem, amath, emath, pure lit, elect geog/ss, eng, hcl.

668,[JC] Might/probably need to stay in a hostel from next year.,"Background information:

I moved here with my family when I was Primary 1 due to my father liking the education system in Singapore, and have studied in local schools all the way until today, where I am a J1 student. A few years back, my father left Singapore (alone) and is now working in my home country, with my mother, brother and I remaining here so that we can continue our studies. Well, I guess ICA doesn't like non-tax-paying families, because today I just found out my PR status will only be renewed for one more year. That means I need to make some adjustments. For starters, I'll have to look into a new place to live, because my mother (and maybe my brother) plan on returning to our home country once the PR status is revoked. My parents are willing to support me studying in a hostel, but right now I have zero idea on where I can stay. As far as I know, my school only offers boarding as an experience. I have heard that other schools (to be specific, I am looking at SA Hall) open their hostels to students studying in other schools, but this is unverified information. Could an informed soul enlighten me on how these hostels work? Thanks!!

Backstory, I was in the Alvls route and didn’t do well so I retained in my Y1 and graduated with an Alvls cert with 60rp. Contemplated of going SIMGE or SUSS PT which most of my friends did but decided not to because I wanted to change combi. Took a gap year to work and find what my interests were. Went back to poly to do the whole 3 years (applied for the direct 2 years but was rejected and placed to a different 3 year course bcos my L1R4 wasn’t good enough :( ) graduated with fairly okay GPA ah I mean normal 3.5 literally 3.57 like that for 5th sem and was offered NUS, NTU and SIT. Currently in NTU.

676,[UNI] JC vs UNI?,"
hi! saw a similar thread about poly vs uni and was curious about jc vs uni HAHAH. but i can’t seem to find a past thread on this or maybe i’m a bad searcher HAHAHA but what are the differences btw JC and UNI?

1. Academics: JC is known to be more intense and academics focused. oh & it has a lot more projects than JC i guess. is UNI very similar to JC such that academics is super intense and many lessons are cramped into a 5 day work week?

2. Social Life: one assumption i have for uni is that you have to be social and be able to make lots of friends? like uni is a place for stepping out of your comfort zone and u have a better social life compared to jc HAHA. how true is this? && does everyone like to go clubbing in uni? :o seems like a stereotype of uni students. 

3. CCAs: are CCAs compulsory in uni? some ppl take up ccas only for the sake of hall points or smth but are CCAs important other than for that reason & also portfolio?

4. Portfolio: is it important to beef up ur portfolio in uni? do workplaces actually consider what you have done in uni/ contributed to society, etc. ? 

5. Environment: how true is it that people in uni can be very toxic and only befriend you for the sake of benefitting from you? i was talking to my teacher and apparently he had a bad time in uni and learnt to be more wary of people because of how people can be toxic :// i’m concerned about whether i can really make genuine friends in uni?

678,[rant] still mad at seab for pure bio paper 2.,"it's been almost half a day and i'm still fuming mad.

it's the way we spent our past 4 YEARS learning about animal cells, plant cells, enzymes, the various systems in our body - digestive system, respiratory system, circulatory system, reproductive system, nervous system, urinary system, - systems in plants, how plants make food how plants take in water how plants remove water et cetera, but almost the entire fking paper was on cell division, molecular genetics, and inheritance. WHY the bloody hell did NONE of the other topics - except for a mere uterus and an artery - appear in our paper??????????

it already sucked that we didnt have a choice for the either/or question, leaving us forced to do the first option - HA thats right! it was about genetic engineering too! - but did they REALLY have to dedicate almost all of the remaining questions to my fking dna?? nothing about our freaking systems and the smallest details on how they work 24/7 in our body, all the in-depth details about the tiny root hairs and unnoticeable vascular bundles in plants, NOTHING. no one gives a sh\*t about what discontinuous variation is and how many bloody chromosomes are in that one goddamn cell tbh. 

yeah some people may argue ya but you cant blame seab or cambridge because they did test what you learnt in bio?? sis. cell division, molecular genetics, and inheritance are all under ""continuity of life"" (even reproduction so thats like the whole paper but 1 question hahaha) the third theme in our syllabus. it hurts more that we just so happened to have to learn these topics during a pandemic, but the paper was set way before so i cant say shit about that. it just fking HURTS my heart given how difficult it was for me to cope with school during hbl and just this year in general. of the 3 themes in our syllabus (ecology is a theme of its own so i excluded it), continuity of life is the SMALLEST so what the hell happened to literally the 11 other chapters? funny cuz those topics are the ones we learnt more about in lower sec too but okay hahaha.  last time i checked we were doing an O Level paper that should roughly cover most of the syllabus, not a fucking topical tys.

maybe the ones who spotted molecular genetics to come out and focused their revision on molecular genetics are happy. good for you, i'm glad this paper probably went well for you. but for the rest of us who put in so much effort to understand and memorise every other topic as well so thoroughly and thus might not have done as well today as the former because they had to cram the other 11 topics too... to me it's just fucking uncalled for for seab to just cheat us like that.

it pisses me off so much that students like me worked their asses off the past year, memorising the crazy processes with so much detail, waiting for this very day to regurgitate everything and finally prove our understanding and in-depth knowledge of this subject but it was just a huge disappointment. 

it feels like a waste. 

the only paper where we can authentically pour out all that we've learnt with specific jargon and precise explanations to prove how hard we have studied and how well we've understood the subject, and seab decides to fuck us over like that??? imo only the post-fertilisation and insulin genetic engineering qns were the most, or only,, legit questions they tested bc what the fk was everything else???

yeah sure we still have paper 1 which will probably (hopefully) cover the rest of the topics but lets be real, you can have a rough idea of most of the syllabus and still score well except for some of the questions that ask for specifics. 

and no, telling me that there's a bell curve / moderation honestly doesn't make me feel much better. do i sound spoilt? maybe. but i just feel scammed as fk, my school papers are fking horrible but at least they really tested our knowledge on the whole syllabus not like this lil piece of shit we call seab.

seab, you really went too far this time idk whether to cry or laugh anymore. we can only depend on paper 1 to do us justice but at this point im just fking demotivated and disheartened that my 4 years of learning biology in pain just went down the drain like that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jjnerp/rant_still_mad_at_seab_for_pure_bio_paper_2/,True,2020-10-29 05:08:48
679,[RANT] saw people posting about crushes so i thought i’d do it,"LOL I HOPE YOU DONT SEE THIS 

HI so uh i’ve always been wanting to rant about this but whenever i talk about it to my friends they’d say that i should just get over it and always say the same stuff (can’t blame them cos i’ve been crushing on this person for 17 months and talked to it abt them for 17 whole months LOL) so context, i’m in sec 3 and i’ve liked this person ever since like start of sec 2 i think (i’m from a girls school so u know) and they are the first ~girl~ i’ve ever liked so i’m a bit confused LOL. 

i wasn’t even attracted to her when i saw her like i didn’t find her cute/pretty or anything. but then after some time of getting to know her(not rly lllll just observing from afar, not knowing i like her), i started talking about her to my friends, LOOKING AT HER TIMETABLE(i’m not a stalker), wanting to see her,, and all this happened while i was oblivious about my feelings for her. but when i realised i was doing all this stuff i felt rather confused as i’ve always thought i was straight. from then on, when i see her “”””my heart started beating a lot faster than it should, i became nervous with sweaty palms etc etc,, WHATEVER””””” AND THE FUNNY THING IS WE DONT EVEN TALK TO EACH OTHER(met through cca) so that’s another confusing one. i thought it was just infatuation and it’ll go away but months passed and it didn’t seem to go away. i’ll start crying because of her as i couldn’t find a way out of this feeling. i know it sounds a little dramatic but i’m scared that this feeling would never go away. i confessed to her around the start of 2020 and she was real nice about it but i knew she couldn’t reciprocate the feelings. i still continued to like her lmaoooo i wish it was a choice. 

what’s infatuation and love anyway? like i like her because when i observe, she’s caring and observant?? she does all these things that just make me BENEJDJSJ and her smile is real cute btw ok i should really stop.  she’s graduating and ill most likely never get to see her again so🙃🙃🙃has anyone ever encountered a situation like this?? have y’all gotten over them??

684,[META] There's always someone better than you.,"## This post is dedicated to all those who are receiving their A Level results today. For everyone else, maybe you’ll find it relevant too!

&#x200B;



\\\\ From young, we’ve always had this competitive mindset drilled into us – we are constantly comparing our achievements with our peers. You want to be the cream of the crop – you want to be better than your peers, your siblings, your relatives – basically everyone else. Truthfully, who doesn’t? 

\\\\ In a highly competitive education system (like that of ours) – it seems like the only way to succeed is to do better than our peers, which inevitably gives rise to our competitive nature. More often than not, we end up feeling inferior compared to our peers. Why am I not in a better school? Why am I as smart as my classmates? Most of us have been there – we constantly feel second to the people around us, which leads to a constant pressure on ourselves to outdo others. That’s fine, it’s what pushes us to become a better version of ourselves every day.

\\\\ However, often, in the midst of all this stress, our perception gets clouded. We get so caught up with doing better than others, we fail to see the good in ourselves. Think of it as attribute points in RPGs. The distribution of the ‘points’ are different for each and every one of us. Some of us here excel as athletes. Some of us here excel as leaders. Some of us here excel in academics. Take a step back, reflect on your own strengths and weaknesses, or even, ask your friends and family about it – you’ll realise there’s more good in yourself than you’ve ever noticed.

\\\\ There’s more to life than excelling academically. Just to name a few: There’s the social aspect of life – the community around you, your friends, your family. There’s the personal aspect of life – your own character, your personal physical health. There’s the emotional aspect of life – your own mental health, your self-esteem. It’s absolutely alright for you not to excel at every aspect of life, there’s always another aspect that’ll more than make up for it. There’s always someone out there that’s better than you in one aspect, but there’s another aspect of yourself that’ll make up for it. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**TL;DR**: It really doesn’t matter if there’s someone out there that’s better than you (there always is) – what truly matters is: you are a better version of yourself today than yesterday. Your grades don’t define who you are. Appreciate yourself and the people around you

To everyone receiving your results – All the best – no matter your results, don’t give up – life doesn’t stop here. You will only get an opportunity to succeed if you try. If you tried your best, there's absolutely nothing to regret.

686,[O LEVELS] post O-level result collection pep talk,"EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up so much considering this is my first post, thanks for the awards guys and hope this post managed to speak to your heart!




This one is for y'all O level mates, first of all good job on seeing this through the end. Having gone through so much trash in 2020, you all really deserve the world! If you did well, good for you. I wish you all the best in your future endeavours, really take this time to celebrate and enjoy yourselves. For those who didn't manage to hit their expectations, then this post is here for you.

I want to start by saying I really appreciate and value all of your hard work, I mean u gotta give it to yourself. Studying in the midst of such a drastic pandemic is something we have never done before, learning through online lessons is also kinda hard too, information just doesn't go into the brain the same way as physical lessons. Working your ass off and pouring your heart and soul into studying and then finding out you didn't do well is a new level of pain. Trust me, we have all been there. Sadly, the amount of effort you put in does not equate to the amount of success you get from it. This reality is just a bitter pill that we all have to learn to swallow. 

We live in a society that is highly competitive and with a broken system. I admit, Singapore's education is actually good but there is a lot of competition to be the best. The infamous ""bell curve"" is a double-edged sword, it has helped to pull the grades up of those who consistently didnt do well but it has also caused those who excel to be pitched against one other. Achieving an A in school is no longer enough, we have to fight against each other to be the cream of the crop in the nation to be worthy of a true A. 

Even if you didn't get the grades you want, learn to take a step back and look back on yourself. You have put in so much effort in studying, heck you probably burnt yourself out, lost so much sleep, repeatedly practised ur TYS to the point u can remember which questions are on which page and consulted your teacher on a daily basis. Don't think of yourself as a failure, appreciate all of your hard work and told yourself that you did your best and that's all that matters. Don't think about ""What happened?"", think about ""What should I do?"". Channel all that energy into looking into your future and what you really want to do as a working adult. 

Doing well academically would help you get into the course that you desire, but surviving in that course is a different ball game. On that note, don't let your results crush your dreams of what you want to be. Let's say if you want to be a doctor and didn't do well in your O levels, and you couldn't go to a Junior College. Instead of tailoring your dreams to suit your grades, change your mindset and tell yourself to go for the long road. Perhaps you could go do a science related course in polytechnic, and if u still fail to make it to medicine in Uni, go do a pre-Med undergrad degree and then try once more for post-grad Med. Don't give up so easily, the possibilities are really endless so stay positive and keep trying, it isn't the end of the world. Clutch onto your dreams hard and keep your eyes on the prize, it doesn't matter if it's a long road, as long as you get what you want, that's all that matters. If you give up that easily, I really question your passion for your dreams.

Your worth is also more than your grades. Your grades don't define who you are and how successful you are. So don't let the world look down on you and don't look down on yourself. Learn to love yourself and acknowledge your hard work. Chin up boyyy, who cares if people judges your score, if u portray yourself as confident and a go-getter who doesn't fall easily from difficulties, nobody can stop you and YOU ARE THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO IS GONNA GEAR UP FOR SUCCESS.

I wish you all the best in your future endeavours, continue keeping up your positive attitude and I know you will succeed someday!

689,[RANT] my grandmother moving in with me has been affecting my life / studies in my O level year,"ok first things first, if you recognize my story yes it's me (please don't expose) uou can text me if u see this tho i'll just laugh. just needed to rant anonymously and perhaps get some advice...

firstly to give some context, it's my o level year and yes o levels are starting soon, hence the ""studying"" factor is crucial right now.

two months ago, my grandmother moved into my house and she now shares the same room with me (her sleeping on my bed and me sleeping on a pull out mattress). but this routine is nothing new to me as she usually sleeps over at my house 1 or 2 nights every week. hence, when she first came over, i thought she would only stay the few nights as usual. but the nights she stayed got longer, from 1 week to 1 month, and 1 month to 2 months. this was all without my ""consent"" though, like nobody told me she was gonna stay here for a whole TWO MONTHS.

the issue of me having to share a room with her is that firstly, i constantly have to go to the dining room with all my materials when she wants to sleep, as my study area is also in my room. it will take me about 10min to move all my stuff to the dining table, and 10min back to my room to pack again. she shared a room with me throughout my prelims and it became a prominent issue for me as i'm a late night mugger. (and yes i mug from day till night, so ""start studying earlier"" isn't really a solution)
it frustrates me that i have to waste time moving my stuff as i really, have alot of materials, and sometimes i have to go in and out of the room when i forget to take something. furthermore, i will lock myself in my room so that nobody comes in to disturb me. but since she stays in the same room as me, she'll have some medications or belonging s in my room which i'll have to unlock the door to let her in for her to take them (and this happens about 3 to 4 times a day, from 4pm when i reach home to study) 

secondly, sleep. my grandmother is a really heavy ""snorer"" and goes in and out of the room often for toilet runs. hence it really affected my ability to fall asleep. about 2 weeks into her moving in, i started having to toss and turn for about 1-2 hours in bed before actually being able to fall sleep (this happens every single night). sometimes i get woken up in the middle of the night to if she goes out. this already was an issue for me since she came for her frequent sleep overs, i never could get used to it but i bared with it since they were just once a week (i typically sleep alone btw). but its worse now that she sleeps with me every night, and it affected me during prelims too as i got lesser sleep than i normally did.

why did she move over in the first place? my grandmother recently got something called 生蛇 in chinese, my dad told me its shingles ?? idk google said its shingles / herpes zoster. so because she got that my dad wanted her to stay here for so that he could take care of her. it seemed fine to me at first bc she actually seemed in pain, and i expected ""awhile"" to be maybe 2 weeks. but as time passed, she seemed less in pain and shes practically back to her normal ways now (daily routine is sitting on the sofa for 6 hours playing ipad games or sleeping). it's very clear that she's comfortable living here as have a helper that would cook her food and wash her dishes, which she did not have at home (living alone). she says that her pain lasts for a long time, even up to a few years for her illness. in week 1 she said that better for her to stay with us as there was a covid case in her block and she wanted to avoid it. fast forward to week 6 and she is still using the same excuse.....(i'm sure yall can make sense of this yourselves)

as this got more of a problem to me, i told my mom my struggles week 1.5 of my grandmother moving in. and well she had HER struggles too regarding my grandmother. she tried to talk to my dad about this issue and said, ""we're gonna move into our new house with her soon so whats the issue?"", ""i used to stay with my two sisters in the same room too, why can't (I) do the same?""

i have two brothers too and i have shared rooms with them before, so its not an issue for me to not have my room to myself. (i would actually prefer squeezing in a room with my 2 bros then sharing a room with just my grandmother 😭 but the setting of my study area doesn't allow me to) but my sleeping habits CANNOT match with my grandmother's, hence its a problem. furthermore i have a major exam coming up and i can't just move my whole ass study table and tons of materials from my room to the dining table right now? (this issue wouldn't even have been so crucial to me if it wasn't for my o levels coming up)

this also affected me mentally as i would sometimes cry in bed while trying to fall asleep because i just CAN'T fall asleep, and it would sometimes be the night before and exam, making me even more worried. my mom tried to talk to my dad the second time 1 month of my grandmother moving in, but he just flared up at my mom and even threatened to divorce her. it made me so SO mad bc the second time, my mom told him about how affected i was and how i was crying constantly bc i couldn't make myself fall asleep. yet he still didn't care and only had his.

my mom and i tried thinking of solutions for my grandmother to continue staying here and for me to have a condusive studying environment. but my house is really too small...the size of a 4 room flat with 7 people living in it, i think you can imagine the situation we are in. 

my dad's a scary person and i knew that if i told him that i was uncomfortable with sharing a room with his mother he would flare up at me. hence it took me a long time to pick up the courage and speak to him about it (seeing how my mom tried to talk to him about it twice but to no avail). i did this recently, and sure enough he flared up at me, and didn't let me finish what i wanted to say. which really upsetted me bc i hoped that maybe if a second person raised this up to him he would give it some thought.

now i really don't know what to do, neither does my mom, to get my grandmother to move back home. we are thinking of asking one of my bros (bro 1) to exchange with my grandmother so that i share a room with him and she shares a room with my bro 2. it's better for me since bro 1 games till late night and sleeps about the time i sleep after i finish mugging, so we are able to accomodate AND he doesn't snore 😭 problem is bro 2 doesn't like sleeping with my grandmother too so we are putting HIM in a spot....

not even sure if there will be ppl that make it this far but please give some suggestions on what i can do @ users of reddit....or is this just spoilt brat behaviour and i should just deal with it ??? i really have no clue....

p.s. alot of holes in this ""essay"" bc it's too long of a story...if u need more context please ask in the replies

p.s. yes i'm typing this bc i can't sleep but thank god tomorrow's a sunday 😂

tldr : sorry it's super hard to summarise...along the lines of grandmother snores and i can't sleep, can't study in my room when she sleeps early, can't convince dad to ask her to move back home bc he gets angry and me and my mom for even asking, have no idea what to do


edit : there's alot of people suggesting that my dad exchange places with me so that i sleep with my mom and my grandma sleeps with my dad. it's something we considered before but it's quite hard since the studying factor accounts my mom who sleeps early so i'll still have to move my things in and out. many other factors of belongings in different places, my mom does her work in her own room too until late at night (which we thought she could just do in my room if we share it, but my room is too small for 2 tables) basically we are planning to do this after my o levels if my grandmother continues staying since i won't need to study anymore, but it's not possible when my o levels are going on and i still need to study haha

edit #2 : thanks for all the responses guys! there's alot rn and i have to study so i won't be able to reply to all of you, but i just wanna say thanks for the advice and i'll keep them in mind!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j4ibpv/rant_my_grandmother_moving_in_with_me_has_been/,True,2020-10-04 08:46:15
690,[Meta] Prelim results and the quality of posts on this subreddit,"It's the time when more and more Sec 4s have gotten back their prelim results, the sub has been receiving more and more ""Is my results alright"" type of posts.

While not the original reason I made the post, it's important to realise why others may not feel the same way as you. There is only one word to sum it up. **Expectations**. Everybody will have different expectations on what kind of grades they will get. Some people can get a L1R5 of 20+ and still be overjoyed because it was an improvement, some will be utterly disappointed.

Thus, it's all relative to the actual person. **Are you happy with your prelim results?** Will it get you into your choice school/ course? If you are still unsure, look at your JAE booklet for the cut off points for the courses or schools you are interested in.

If you are happy, then maintain your score! Don't be complacent, continue to do your TYS and practice papers.

If you aren't happy with your results, then you need to work harder! You can ask this sub, the Discord or Telegram group chats (you can find the links in the sidebar) about how to improve for a certain subject.

Which brings me to my main point, **search the sub first for previous posts that others may have made**. Many times, these posts are still relevant and can help you! Duplicate posts simply make the job of the mods more difficult and clogs up the sub.

We can all work together to keep the posts on this sub of a decent quality. Here's also a reminder to **use the daily megathread to submit short questions**, and refrain from duplicating your text simply to hit the character limit, as this often means that your question should belong in the megathread instead!

Also, to those taking exams, please take good care of yourself and don't burn out! If you feel overwhelmed, there is always someone to talk to.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iyzqc7/meta_prelim_results_and_the_quality_of_posts_on/,True,2020-09-25 07:49:22
691,[Rant] Pride And Toxicity,"Pride is something everyone needs to have; something small to acknowledge your accomplishments. It encourages you to go forth and give your best for further tasks. Some tend to take pride too seriously, and it turns into toxicity and display a strong sense of elitism. It's just repelling; I can't comprehend people who have the inability to draw the fine line between pride and toxicity.

Who cares if you're from an established institution, or someone who entered a private institution to continue further studies? What matters is the attitude to learn and the willingness to learn from past mistakes. What matters is the determination to get back up on your feet when you've had a heavy fall. You may have given a lot of effort to get to your desired institution; be it NUS or NTU or SUTD or even JCs or Secondary schools. You have a right to call yourself a distinguished student, but you don't have the right to look down on the rest who didn't do as well, but are trying to climb back up. A degree is a piece of paper. Grades are just on a piece of paper. Yes, the piece of paper may get you to some places, but that piece of paper does not, and should not undermine your capabilities as a person.

There will always be people who look down on private institutions, second tier schools and more. There will be people with high ego.  What they have to understand is that every school is a good school indeed, and the establishment of your institution does not guarantee your ladder of success. With such flawed attitude, I can assure these people will be bound to fall someday. My heart goes out to all who feel pressured by the norms and high expectations of the society. Everyone will get their fair share of success they deserve for the efforts they put in. Hardships can always see the light at the end of a dark tunnel.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ii9mia/rant_pride_and_toxicity/,True,2020-08-29 07:54:57
692,[Poly] What’s poly orientation like?,"hello, I was wondering what poly orientation is like? (to be specific, in NP) if school starts on 20th april, when will orientation start and for how long? what happens during orientation? from personal experience, did it help you to make friends from your course/school/batch before lessons actually started? kind of worried I won’t be able to make friends easily so I’m hoping orientation will allow me to do easier",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/erp0v4/poly_whats_poly_orientation_like/,True,2020-01-21 19:50:34
693,[O Level] advice for picking where to go,"hi i'm intending to use this as a throwaway account but thought since O Level results have been released it would be good to share some experiences of my friends to help if anyone is still contemplating whether to head to jc, poly or even MI. hope my friends don't actually see this post lol but i think sharing these will help. i took o's in 2019 and am currently a j2 so these experiences are for graduates of my batch!!

one of my friends had enrolled in a jc (won't reveal which) but as she struggled trying to balance both CCA and her studies she couldn't find herself coping well for the first few months of jc. she then soon transferred out to a poly around march right before poly started in april and she's now managing much better in poly.

one of my other friends enrolled in another jc but also struggled to cope with his studies. however, he decided to see how it would go and continued to stay in jc. in the end he didn't do too well for his studies and ended up having to retain and repeat j1 this year. he too, just decided to transfer out to poly.

and another one of my friend who initially wanted to head to a jc or MI as they wanted to go to university ended up picking a poly course that seemed interesting because his score wasn't low enough to enter the jc he wanted to. besides, his parents also tried to convince him to just go to poly which also influenced his final decision. now he's trying to transfer to MI and will know his results soon.

i'm not really good at leaving reddit posts lmao but i just thought it would be good to share this because ultimately, you should be making your own choices on your future educational paths and if you let your decision be swayed by your friends or family, the only person losing out really will just be you. although most open houses this year will be online which will never be as good as actual open houses, do check all your options and do put in effort to do some research on which courses would be more suited to your aptitude and interests and even what subjects you may want to take in jc!

the idea that jc is better and harder than poly is largely outdated so make sure you choose what would suit you better because both have clearly different environments which may or may not suit you! no matter where you choose to go you'll still have to handle the stress that comes with assignments, tests and exams so the best you can do now at this stage is to figure out what you really want to do :) please choose wisely so that you won't regret later on!!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwbffg/o_level_advice_for_picking_where_to_go/,True,2021-01-13 23:12:59
694,[o levels] ss tipsssssssss,"1. Inference
This is relatively simple: it’s what the source wants to say.
One tip I got from my ss teacher is to ask “so what?” over and over again
that way, you won’t miss out on what the source wants to say 
IMPORTANT: DO NOT COPY OR PARAPHRASE THE SOURCE ONLY.
you do need to refer to the source (through quoting and stuff) but you need to get the message out of there as well
so ask yourself “so what?” as you write your answer, and make sure you don’t repeat your points 
generally, inference qns require 1-2 paragraphs, but don’t stress too much pls
use at most 6 mins for this question

2. Purpose
this is basically about why the person is saying what they’re saying
VAMIC is very very important
V: verb (what they want to do: convince, encourage, justify, etc.)
A: audience (who they’re saying this to: the public, the Govt., etc.)
M: message (what they’re saying; basically, the inference)
I: intentions(?) (what outcome they want by saying this: discredit/justify something, convince ppl to (not) support something,etc.)
C: context (what situation they’re saying this in: maybe they’re facing opposition and need support, idk)
the provenance and background info are extremely important, especially for describing the context
besides asking yourself “so what?”, you also need to ask “so why?” (aka the outcome)
taking note of the author(s) is very important as it would give clues on what outcome they want, who they support, etc.
purpose qns. generally require 1-2 paragraphs,and usually do not have much weightage 
use around 6-7 mins for this qn

3. Comparison
you need to compare the sources and see where they are similar/different
If the question asks “In what ways are (the sources) similar/different”, you have to talk about only similarities/differences
if it asks “How are they similar/different”, you need to state both similarities and differences
usually, we start by comparing similarity/difference in content
make sure that you’re comparing the same thing, as in make sure the part of the sources that you quote is about the same person/event/thing
generally, 2 paragraphs of similarity/difference by content would get you at least half of the allocated marks
similarity/difference in tone/purpose would make your answer more advanced (and probably help you get more marks)
for similarity/difference in tone, look at how the source is talking about something: are the mocking it? do they have a positive or negative view of it? or does it seem to be neutral? 
the highest level of answer is usually similarity/difference in purpose. use VAMIC (as above) to state the purpose of each of the sources
personally, comparison questions are quite tedious to do, so i skip to doing sim/diff. in purpose first (though you may get zero if you mess up)
at best (in terms of time), comparison qns should have around 3 paragraphs (2 for content, 1 for purpose/tone)
these questions take a pretty long time to cover everything, so i’d suggest 7-8 mins for this qn

4. Reliability
REMEMBER TO CROSS-REFER
cross-referring to another source would usually allow you to gain at least half the marks! the process is similar to comparing based on content, but you can choose ANY OF THE SOURCES (or even your contextual knowledge if you feel confident)
do they say the same thing about something? then the source you’re focused on is reliable as it is supported by the other source
if not, it is unreliable as what it says differs from the other source
as with comparison questions, the highest level is usually purpose
the source is unreliable if it has a biased purpose, and reliable if it has a balanced viewpoint
MAKE SURE TO USE VAMIC IF YOU ARE EVALUATING PURPOSE, OR ELSE IT MAY BE SEEN AS EVALUATING WITH PROVENANCE WHICH IS ONLY L2/2
generally, reliability questions require around 2 paragraphs: 1 for cross-referencing and 1 for purpose
these qns may take around 6-7mins
REMEMBER TO STATE YOUR STAND ON WHETHER THE SOURCE IS RELIABLE

5. Utility
this question asks whether a source is “useful”: IT IS NOT A RELIABILITY QUESTION
generally, most sources are useful as they give info
one way of evaluating a source’s utility is by checking its reliability through cross-referencing
it’s a similar process to reliability, but YOU ARE EVALUATING THE SOURCE’S UTILITY, NOT RELIABILITY 
if the source is reliable (through cross-referring), it is useful and vice versa
as above, the highest level comes from evaluating purpose
it is useful if it gives a balanced viewpoint and not useful if it has a biased purpose
generally, utility questions require 2-3 paragraphs: 1-2 for content and reliability and 1 for purpose
time taken would be similar to reliability (6-7mins)
REMEMBER TO STATE YOUR STAND ON WHETHER THE SOURCE IS USEFUL

6. SURPRISE!!!!!!
surprise questions are funky hybrid questions (that I personally detest)
again, SURPRISE QUESTIONS ARE NOT RELIABILITY QUESTIONS, though the way you approach them is similar
for surprise questions, what you should look out for are what the source says (content) and who is saying it (the author’s profile)
CROSS-REFERRING IS IMPORTANT
see if the content in the source you’re focusing on is similar to that of which you’re referring to. if it is, it is not surprising and vice versa
next, look at the author. would they have anything to gain for saying something? do they want to defend something? then it shouldn’t be surprising.
but if what the author is saying is not typical of how they (or others they’re associated with) view something, then it is surprising.
usually, surprise questions require 1-2 paragraphs; 1 for content, 1 for the author’s profile
these qns may take around 6-7mins
again, REMEMBER TO STATE YOUR STAND

7. Evaluation
usually the last question, usually the worst question
they are worth 8 marks in history (or at least for the syllabus I’m using) and 10 marks in SS
I (the person currently writing here) personally detest these qns
either way, evaluation questions require you to look at ALL THE SOURCES, so read thru all of them and underline/highlight whatever connects to the question/statement and see whether it agrees/disagrees with it
some sources may not directly agree or disagree with the statement, in which case you can argue for it supporting either side
generally, the “formula” goes like this:
“Source _ agrees/disagrees with the statement” or “Using source _, I agree/disagree with the statement”.  Then, state your evidence and inference. Again, asking yourself “so what?” endlessly is a good strategy, because you may risk blindly lifting from the source and losing marks. Make sure you write down an inference on whether the source supports the statement, not just what the source says about it.
Repeat the process for the other sources (generally, use at least 2 sources that agree and 2 that disagree with the statement). Try to cite different reasons for each source to agree/disagree with the statement: the authors of 2 sources may agree with the statement, but for different reasons. Maybe it benefits certain people? Or it benefits the economy?
if you manage to evaluate all the sources, you’d get 8 marks in SS and 7 marks in History. To get the extra mark(s), you’d need to further evaluate a source by reliability/utility, or do a conclusion. generally, Teachers suggest using reliability, bcos conclusions are HARD.
make sure that if you’re using reliability, the source you’re evaluating hasn’t been evaluated for reliability in previous qns. for instance, if there’s a question that goes like “is source _ reliable/useful?”, don’t use that source later for evaluation.
evaluation qns require quite a lot of time and effort, so you may need to use up an entire page just for this question. generally, you’d have 10-15mins to do this question if you plan well.

8. Other funky question types 
There are many other types of qns, mostly weird hybrid questions. I’ll give a few examples of funky questions (source names are arbitrary):

“Does source A prove that source B is wrong?”
this may seem like a comparison question, but it also involves reliability. 
first, compare the source based on content. if what is said in source B contradicts source A, source A proves that source B is wrong.
I believe another step involves comparing both sources to another source? like, if another source supports what is said in source B, then source A alone cannot prove that source B is wrong.
finally, evaluate source A for reliability. Does it have a balanced viewpoint? Then it is reliable and can prove that source B is correct/wrong. If not, if it has a vested purpose, it is unreliable and cannot prove source A correct/wrong.

“Source C and source D say different things about ___. Does that mean one of them is lying?”
This question not only involves comparing the sources on what they say, but also on whether they are lying. Note: even if they are biased, that doesn’t mean they’re lying.
First, compare them based on content. The baseline is, they say different things so oNe oF tHeM sHouLd bE LyiNg. of course, this is just comparing via content, so not many marks can be gotten from stating that.
Next, compare them to another source. Does what is said in the other source contradict source C/D? Then it may be lying.
Then evaluate the sources based on reliability/utility. One of the sources may have a biased purpose, so it may be lying.
finally, if the sources are not wholly lying, state that even if one of the sources is biased, it still gives someone’s perspective on the issue and thus may not be fully lying.
idk this question is a bit strange, but it’s similar to utility.

“Using source E, are you surprised by source F?”
predictably, this is a comparison/surprise question.
first, you basically have to compare the two sources. Do they say different things? Then you should be surprised.
note that the question is asking for whether you’re surprised about source F. So for later steps, that source should be the focus.
compare source F to another source. compare their content, blah blah blah.
the rest of the steps are similar to approaching a surprise question.

There are many different funky hybrid questions, but most require some form of comparison as well as reliability/utility/surprise. Make sure you read the question carefully. But don’t spend too much time: 7-8mins should be enough.

695,[Uni] I am from NTU Accountancy. AMA!,"I have just completed my last few papers as an NTU Nanyang Business School accountancy student a month ago.

I think that I am in a very good position to answer any doubts or clear any clarifications that anyone may have about Nanyang Business School or accountancy degree in general given that I am a very recent graduate. You can also ask me anything about the modules or the culture of NBS. I have completed 2 Big 4 internships as well so I guess I can try my best to answer anything you may want to know about internships as an NBS accounting student.

So please ask away!

***Note: Still taking questions as of Nov 2020***

Any other seniors please feel free to reply or provide an alternate perspective. Thank you :)

&#x200B;

**\[Some common questions/clarifications\]**

* NBS has been adopting seminar style teaching for quite a few years already. NUS too. All our modules have class participation grading component too, sadly. Stop having this misconception that only SMU practices seminar style lessons.

* If you take the BL9305 Advanced Tax module, u can be ***exempted*** from the ISCA chartered accountancy tax paper. You need a certain grade for this module in order to gain the exemption though :/

* You will still graduate on time if you go on exchange; going on exchange does not delay graduation

* For some reason, NTU acc students tend to gravitate towards big 4 for internship or perm hire i also dk why. This probably explains the low starting pay compared to other biz schools zzzzzz.

* Compared to other business schools, NBS has the most inflexible curriculum and thus, you won't get to learn other business disciplines freely. We do not allow you to as freely take a NBS minor (NOTE: Minor in DDA/strat comm, not so sure about minor in international trading) as other unis, if you are not offered at point of admissions and accepted. NBS does not have a second NBS major/spec to NBS students. You can apply to minor/majors to other faculties though. \[NBS please do something about this\]

* For those that wants to take the minor in DDA but not offered, maybe you can consider taking the Minor in Computing and Data Analysis from the School of Computer Science and Engineering instead.

* NBS has just partnered with Deloitte to launch a new elective/UE module ***AB9103 Audit Analytics.***",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gr4hia/uni_i_am_from_ntu_accountancy_ama/,True,2020-05-27 12:03:31

697,[JC] post JAE results (things u probably want to know),"since everyone keep posting and asking, ill just type main points so yall dont have to keep asking! (upvote so rest can see lol)

**what time do we report at jc/mi?**

730am !! its on moe website or straits times if im not wrong

**what do we wear?**

your secondary school uniform or pe, OGS should probably call you tmr evening or smth around there. if they don't, just wear sec sch uniform.

**what if i threw away my school uniform?**

wear your pe shirt or smth, maybe school shirt, something for them to identify which school youre from

**when do we buy textbooks and uniform?**

you will probably buy all these during ori week, the school will inform yall in advance and bookshop will still be open throughout your jc year.

**what if i have colour hair? what if i no school socks?**

go colour it back to black or smth and wear white socks ok

**who are OGS?**

basically ori camp leaders, usually j2 seniors

**what if i cannot attend sch for 14 days?**

just call up the school ! dont worry about studies, its usually introducing the subjects , you wont miss much! and theres online learning now if u rlly want to learn and catch up !

**what are the school rules?**

its almost similar to secondary like the basics, no dyed hair, no painted nails, school socks etc. school rules can be found on the respective jcs website !

700,[O Levels] hear my rant out about all my papers before collecting results,"so basically we r receiving out results on 11/1 and I’m honestly not ready to face my results because I don’t feel very good for all the papers I’ve done?? here’s a run down on how I did for all my papers. I took triple science + elect history but dropped a math.

english.
english was surprisingly not bad for me ig it’s just the listening conpre I think I got around 6/7 marks wrong... i got b4 for prelims so idek if I can keep my hopes high and expect a a2. also my feelings about english papers are just not there like I thought I failed prelim paper 2 but end up I got highest in class. another time I felt good about a practice test and in the end I failed it. haiz I’m not sure about o lvl paper tho, I’ve checked the answer against the suggest answer my answers are kind of there...

physics 
I got b3 for physics prelim. I felt the worse after doing physics paper 1. I literally got 9 wrong for mcq and i just really didn’t expect it because usually I only get 1/2 wrong at most. my effort just didn’t pay off for physics and still I’m disappointed about it. paper 2 I under performed as well I lost about 16 marks(with undetected mistakes I suppose at most 20 marks). practical wasn’t easy but I think I can get about 32-34? before o lvl started I was hoping for a a1 but now that I look at it my overall percentage for physics is about 75-77% so even a a2 seems pretty impossible. because from what I heard for science u have to get full marks for mcq in order to get a1/2 idk how true is that tho because none of my friends got full marks but I did the worst among them...

biology
I got a1 for bio prelims. bio o lvl is another headache. I completely messed up paper 2 so bad and I made a lot of grave mistakes? for example the labeling, I labeled it as cervix muscle instead of cervix... I’m hoping they won’t mark me down for that. I wrote random assortment instead of independent assortment and I made one other spelling mistake. I smoked through the whole paper tbh because I was unsure of everything I wrote. if y’all took the paper, y’all will understand because the tested literally only the chapters that no one will study. bio mcq I lost about 4/5 marks and that isn’t good tbvh... practical was ok maybe I can get 30? I cannot predict my bio overall at all because my paper 2 was literally fked. I’m just hoping bell curve can pull me up to a a2 maybe since everyone found it hard. 

chemistry
i got a1 for chem prelim. I felt the most ok for chem ig, although I felt v sad after chem paper 2 as I lost about 10/11 marks. however my chem practical was not good I confirm lost 7 marks so plus undetected mistakes I probably will only get 28-30. mcq was bad too cause I lost 4 marks haiz. but overall I can get around 80-83% it’s not a guaranteed a1 but I think a a2 shld be fine? but again everyone found chem easy/ok so idk if the bell curve will be in my favour.

ss+ history
lol ok this subject is the most unpredictable for me. prelim I got barely a b4. the ss o lvl sbq was manageable for me but the srq part a may have screwed me up. I can’t remember exactly what they asked for but I remember they asked sth along the line of spread the message or sth. I didn’t really understand the question so I just anyhow bs 2 paragraphs out. history some of my sbq answers differ from my friends and seq there was a part where they asked for stalin and I wrote night of the long knives TnT but luckily that was just one paragraph and went back talking about stalin after that. before os started, I was the most disappointed with combined humans as I studied really hard for prelims and I only got a b4 when I aimed for a a2. so prelims kind of discouraged me and I only aimed for b3 for os. however now I’m just hoping the bell curve can pull me up as I really did not expect my sciences to be so bad.

e math 
i felt really good after the e math papers cause for prelims I studied really really hard and ended up getting a c5??!(and that’s why I dropped a math) I couldn’t remember exactly how many marks I lost but ik I did pretty good? my class is a good class and we top in level for math I got the same number of mistakes as my friends who got a1 for prelims so I felt good. I’m really hoping for a a1 but at the same time I’m scared of the bell curve. I studied a lot of e math the most alongside physics.

hcl 
welps I got b4 for prelims and I was literally so sad. my usual standard was always a a1 and I really don’t know what went wrong during prelims. hcl o lvl I don’t feel really good either tbh cause the zuowen I remember them asking for 人们 and I only wrote about one person... paper 2 the first 3 sections I made either 1/2 mistakes. the summary i barely completed it. can’t gauge hcl... wanted it to be my l1 at first but now ik it’s impossible. maybe a b3/4 for os? if I’m lucky maybe a a2 lol. my Chinese just kept deproving.

chinese 
secured a a1 for chinese. but till this day I was so shocked that I got merit for oral because I usually top in class for oral. it really just showed me how unpredictable ur results can be. most of my friends who got a1 got distinction for oral. honestly after the oral i felt ok and I performed normally thus getting a merit really really shocked me... 

overall i got 14 raw for prelim as l1r5 and I hope that for o lvl I will get at most 12 raw. I’m scared of deproving... especially for sciences as those are the subjects I was usually good in. i got a friend who got full marks for bio mcq but ended up still getting a a2 and another friend who got 5 wrong for physics mcq and ended up getting a b3... this really scares me a lot. I’m scared of getting b3/4. my teachers also say u need full marks for mcq to get a1 zzz hence I felt so disheartened to get so many wrong after my science mcqs. I’m aiming for jcs less than 10. 

thanks for reading guys HAHAH can’t believe y’all made it here. feel free to share your thoughts about o lvl and results prediction !! good luck !!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/krfekf/o_levels_hear_my_rant_out_about_all_my_papers/,True,2021-01-06 19:37:44
701,[Rant] To everyone that scored L1R5 of 25 and above,"You're not alone. 

I know it's super upsetting coming on this sub and seeing people talk about their prelim L1R5s being 15 and below. It's been rough, hasn't it? We're probably still lamenting over how much we studied and yet we still failed, I know I'm still bitter on how I spammed my TYS everyday and still failed my E Math. 

Personally, it's been difficult for me to get back to studying after seeing my results. Funny, right? I thought that my prelims results would finally be the slap of reality I needed to push myself, but it's been difficult to even open my notes or start any practice papers. I guess seeing my results made me realize that the all-nighters and the frequent cramming sessions didn't work for me when it worked for all my friends. It just made me irritable and I couldn't remember information.

So, to the person reading this: take care of yourself. Take breaks when you need to, stop pulling all-nighters if your mental and physical health is starting to be affected by it. If you get anxious over reading how much people have been studying, be it on IG or twitter, get off them. Remember to eat, even if it's small meals. Please don't neglect your health in pursuit of that A1.

Remember, there's only a month left. I know we all can do this, yeah?

702,[O Levels] EL oral day 3,"hii i was the first one and i pretty much managed to babble on about the topic but anyways here’s what most of you came here for. 

video shows 3 elderlies sitting on a bench (2 female and 1 male). the 2 females are talking to one another and drinking some sort of drink. some person with a tag (i’m assuming it’s the worker from an old folk’s home), pouring liquid to others. video takes place in japan during the spring where there are spring blossoms. 

reading aloud passage included words such as ‘triumphs’ and ‘psychologist’. passage is relevant and doable. 

questions asked (credit: a1604) 
1. how do you think the elderlies in the video are feeling.
2. talk about an experience talking to someone from a much older generation. 
3. do you agree with the views that there is a lack of understanding between the older and younger generations?

i am aiming to get into a jc and am wondering about what subject combination i should take. i am planning to go into the arts or hybrid stream, however, i realised that i am not very interested in any particular subject and am average in all subjects so it is difficult for me to make a choice. so i thought that maybe i should choose my subject combination based on the acronym it forms? so my options are:

1: KILME (KI, lit, math, econs)
2. LAME (lit, art, math, econs)
3. ASKFM (art, spanish, KI, further math)
4. SHAG (spanish, history, art, geography)

707,[O LEVELS] CHEMISTRY TIPS THAT WORKS WONDERS,"[O LEVELS] lol this is my fifth time tryna post 

hello everyone! i know alot of yall r checking reddit rn in frantic prep for o’s so imma give u some advice for ur chem papers!! (pure or combi) this may work for other sci but use it to ur advantage okayss. these tips r by my bf who is currently in ri and took O’s in 2019 and it helped me and my friends alot 

READ THE QN!!!
in ques they will use common key words such as WHY or HOW! make sure u answer accordingly. e.g if they ask how and why rate of rxn is diff when ethanoic acid vs nitric acid is used, u must ans with HOW: ethanoic acid slower rate then nitric acid. WHY : ethanoic acid is a weak acid, partically dissociate bs HNO3.... ect ect 

THINKING PROCESS
ok so lets say they ask u to explain why smth and u are not sure how to put it into words or js dk at all, this is a tip : ALWAYS GO BACK TO DEFINITIONS OR MEANINGS
ok so lets use the ethanoic acid vs nitric acid qn again, if they ask WHY the rate of rxn is diff n udk how to ans, u always go back to the definition: Ethanoic acid is a weak acid that only PARTICALLY DISSOCIATE IN WATER. HOWEVER,, nitric acid is a strong acid that FULLY Dissociates.... lower conc of H+ per ... ect ect so always rbm to go back to teh basics

EXPLAINING USING EVIDENCE FROM TABLE/PASSAGE
ok if u do tys bfr u know that these questions r like super common. so u prbly alrdy know this if u did the tys, but if u didnt here. BE SELECTIVE ABT TEH INFO U PICK. ik thrs always alot of info and u might think everything is relevant but in reality it is not!1!1!1!!!! seab wont so easy put qn can pick anyt so u must rly be selective and choose the correct stufff, ik its a very unsafe “bet”. but trust me u put all u wont get the mark.

MARK ALLOCATION 
ok so this is super impt, if a qn is 1 mark u rly dun neeed to go super into detail to explain, but of 2 or more marks, explain as much as u can. i know ppl say “2 mark u put two point can alr” NOOOOOO SISSS. seab tryna differentiate the distinction frm the B frm the C, so u cnt js assume, write what u think is relevant and go into as much detail as u can esp if is more thn 3 markssss 

here r some not so impt tips 
- make sure u know all the OA/RA, the QA test all damn well, usually r ez marks
- every yr P2 got test air topic and its been getting harder so make sure u know ur AIR topic well
- make sure whn u do ur comparison question that u hv a BOC (js like ss) the ask u for difference u must compare (exp 1 no colour change but exp 2 has colour change) cnt js state everyt u see blindly !!!!!!
- trust ur instincts, u alrdy do revision so thrs some things that u rbm thru muscle memory, so js trust ur guts

i know everyone has worked so hard for their grades. pure chem is not ez, not even for my bf, and even my brother who is currently studying chemistry for masters agree that its not an ez subj. u hv come so fucking far so js one last push and ure gna be done. ffs u can do it, be positive, thats the first step towards success. being negative saying “im gna fail im gna fail” only makes u loose hope in urself ok, and rbm MCQ WILL FUCKING SAVE U HAHAHA!

2) does it feel lonely? some of my seniors don’t feel connected to anyone in poly and it’s taking a toll on their mental health TT

hii !! alevel graduate here :)) i just finished applying to the various universities and i’m a little concerned about the school culture in NUS/  NTU / SMU.

i heard that in uni, we have to make friends with people from various faculties in order to get about uni life. 

so how should i open up to talk to all these people ?? 

i want to build as many connections as possible and godddd i hope that it will be long lasting friendships / kingdom friends :) is it always necessary to be an extrovert ? 

JC has transformed me from being an introvert to an extrovert, i’m not afraid to start the conversation first but the question is: HOW DO I MAKE IT SUSTAIN? 

and maybe, if you guys don’t mind, can anyone  give me advice on how to: 

- focus on studies in uni
- plan my time (cause idk how hectic it will be)

714,[O LEVELS] stressed out,"it's 12am, i can't fall asleep and i feel like throwing up. i cried for the first time in 6 months today, and i'm the kind that usually bottles up all my emotions. it's not even because of the emath paper??

not to sound dramatic but i feel like if i don't get a raw of 10 for my L1R5, i'll be a complete failure to my mother.

today she told me at the dinner table, ""your grades and achievements are so average, if you had half of your cousin's achievements, i would brag and show off just like your aunt."" for context, my cousin is a gep student, took psle this year, will probably get 4A* and go to top ip school. i got 3A1A* but not enough to take ip, hence i'm suffering through o levels right now in a bad secondary school.

i feel so... deserving of the words she said? i scored 17 raw for S3 eoys and 14 raw for prelims, which honestly isn't good. jc is my only path because she made it clear she won't support me financially if i go to poly because of the school fees. i honestly don't know who i'm doing o levels for, myself or all the expectations on me.

i want to just do my best for o levels and come satisfied, but i can't stop thinking about how she bought vitamins for me, how she bought me nice food, how she went all the way to plaza sing to get me muji pens, how she didn't scold me for getting my new phone stolen on the way home from prelims. she's giving me so much, and i'm just going to end up disappointing her again just like psle.

716,[A levels] JC...,"Where do I even start...

It’s 3am right now. I had my H2 bio and math promo papers yesterday (idk who the hell thought it was a good idea to put those together, i was SO tired). I came home, ate and passed out on the floor and foung myself panicking when I woke up at 2.13am. I completely messed up my math paper. I didnt do most of the questions. For bio, I studied for it throughout the weekend because I was doing better in bio anyways so I thought it was more worth the last-minute mugging. In 6 hours, I will be doing my H2 chem paper and I’m so ineffably unprepared.

This year in 2 words- shit. show.

I came into JC feeling anticipation. Little did I know that JC was just the beginning of the downfall of my entire life. I never was a consistent worker, but my results all throughout secondary school were excellent. Last minute cramming was sufficient to get by back then. That was the studying method I used all through sec school and for my O levels. I did well and got into the JC I was aiming for. Now, the overwhelming content and the depth of the concepts taught in JC has made it IMPOSSIBLE for me to keep up with, especially since I don’t have the habit of studying consistently. I’ve been failing most of my tests and I’m now at a point where failing doesn’t bother me anymore. (I take BCMe btw)

I know I had an entire year to adapt to the JC lifestyle. But why couldn’t I? Well, alongside the fact that I absolutely cannot cope with change, I fell deep into depression. It was hard- to accept that I’m no longer the ‘perfect’ student I used to be. JC has made me question my intelligence, my grit, and even my self-worth. 

Depression stole a large fraction of time from me. For months on end I couldn’t bring myself to do anything, my sleep and eating schedules were bizarre. Furthermore, while living with such erratic habits, going to school and seeing people study all the damn time made me feel so fucking guilty. But even with that guilt, albeit intense, I wasn’t motivated to do anything. Slowly my mom realised that my life was literally falling apart, and she forced me to see a doctor to get help.

So for a while, my life was dozing off in school, therapy, seeing the counsellor, crying, and feeling numb and worthless. Until a week before promos when my friends started to push me more, because they didn’t want me to retain. I tried. 10 minutes of studying per day... 20 minutes... an hour... 2 hours. I was making progress. But time wasn’t on my side. Now I’m hours away from taking a paper I’m likely to fail. 

I feel demoralised. I can’t believe that merely promoting is a struggle for me. I still remember when I started JC aiming for all As and Bs. What a bloody joke.

So yeah. Basically, I felt like shit and needed to let it out. And in case you feel fucking shitty and alone, just know that you’re not.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j5q6x9/a_levels_jc/,True,2020-10-06 11:35:00

725,[O Levels] Pure science practicals!!,"So pure physics practical is next Monday (5/10) and pure chemistry practical is next Thursday (8/10). I don’t take bio :/

For chem practical, I am wondering how to ensure that my observations are right for QA experiments. I also want to know how to know what type of gases to test. When drawing the graph and they ask you to draw a line of best fit, how do I know if the line will be a straight line or a curve line. If y’all have any other tips for practical, please say it too!!

For physics practical, I am still very confused with the accuracy for the data cause some of them are 2sf and some of them are 2dp. Also, for planning, how do I get as many marks as I can. If y’all have any other tips, it would be very helpful!!!


I am really nervous for practicals because I don’t want it to make me demoralised during the most crucial part of the whole o level journey. All help will be appreciated!!! Thank youuu",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j3o63c/o_levels_pure_science_practicals/,True,2020-10-02 20:35:59

728,[O Levels] JC Campuses 2022,"
hey yalls. if you guys look up on channel news asia on one of their articles on 1st july, you would notice an article on JC’s deferring their campus shifting in 2022. this would basically benefit some of us because we don’t have to travel further 

like if you live in the south, you need not travel further to tampines and can remain in bedok for TJ in 2022 for example.

emailed TJ cuz i was considering them for a while and they confirmed that they will be remaining in their current campus in 2022 too !

affected jcs that are no longer affected in 2022: tj, asr, jp, yi !

hope this provides some clarity.

732,[Poly] Can I seek help from a poly counselor?,"Recently I've been really doing a lot of soul-searching and wanted to really improve myself. My childhood has left me with a lot of toxic / destructive habits that I want to break free of since it seems to have kind of affected my overall quality of life, especially socially. But I'm not depressed or hitting a major low in my life. My self-esteem could be a bit better  and I would say I also have some problems with anxiety but overall I'm just looking to have someone help me be a better person. 

As I'm a foreigner / non-PR, therapy is definitely out of my budget at the moment, which is why I'd like to know if it would be alright to seek counselling sessions from my polytechnic? I understand that counselling tends to be short-term and specific to a life event which is why I'm hesitant to do so. 

Also, experiences with poly counselors would be really appreciated. Do they really care / listen? Also, is everything kept anonymous?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f5nkb9/poly_can_i_seek_help_from_a_poly_counselor/,True,2020-02-18 22:38:24

740,[UNI] how I got into NTU Econs with RP67.5,"The title makes it clear but yah I got into NTU Econs with RP 67.5  in 2019 

Sharing this to all of you out there waiting for results 

Some info:
IP stream (so me getting 67.5 was a real wrecker... I cried in the toilet for 2 hours the moment I saw my results. I dao all my friends’ calls (yah all of them straight As / almost straight As) 

Exco in CCA(non sports) in JC, Org com for VIA, Won quite a few awards while in my CCA, PCME 


Uni offeres:
NTU I put Econs as my first choice... didn’t really expect it as I wasn’t called for interviews and etc like from the moment of submission till receiving the offer letter I didn’t hear anything from the school 

I got my offer on 13th May 2019. I forgot when was the cut off but I remembered it was around the week before? 


NUS:  I placed project management as my first choice and I got it. Although I really wanted FASS bc I want to do Econs but I was scared that I’ll end up school-less so as a safety I placed PM as first. I read a lot about it on Reddit and I’m really counting my lucky stars that I got Econs in NTU 

I received my NUS offer a day later (if I’m not wrong) so hang in there guys 


A levels performance do not determine your Uni performance!! My current GPA is 4.18/5 in Sem 1 (could have been 4.4/5 but I got a 3.0 for one of my electives which really screwed me over) but with COVID my GPA for this sem is probably 4.24/5 (fingers crossed bc I SUed 3/5 of my classes lol) and I’m gunning for that 4.5 first class honours yah 💪💪 

But TLDR it’s not too late now still got time till 24th for results to come out and I feel NTU is more chill than NUS? like in terms of admissions and school culture and everything (although the school experience is a real bummer compared to overseas like London/CAL/NYC etc) but it’s still pretty good none the less

Open to questions 🤗



Edits

+ I don’t stay in hall (although i stay 1.5h away so total 3 hours of travelling per day) so I can’t say much about hall life. The reason why I don’t is the food (NTU school food real sucks. Idk about the hall canteens but those at NS and SS are not the best) and the laundry machine ( I’ve got a pet peeves about sharing laundry machine like think about all the yuck stuff inside the drum... and imagine what kind of clothes are washed) 

+ school culture wise I was in a CCA (in the EXCO too) but after one year I quit (even though I could have moved up to a higher ranked leadership position) bc that CCA was a event Organization based CCA and I didn’t get to learn much from it (except an extra line on my resume which showed my involvement in school)

742,[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,"Edit: I just got accepted in my first choice, Industrial Design and I am thinking of appealing to Archi!

I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I’m not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (third choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don’t shame me, it’s fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there’s literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people’s portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler – 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard –paper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard–paper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore’s/the world's best architectures and what makes them good. Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‘can multiple hierarchies coexist?’ and ‘what are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?’ and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question. It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you’re trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‘abstract’ while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn’t want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‘hm! Good enough’. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‘is the first one from an anime?’ and ‘was the third one a class assignment?’ and ‘were the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?’ (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‘why do you want to study architecture?’ and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn’t really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‘so why is archi your third choice?’ and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they’re applying for Uni.

743,[A Levels] Should I go for arts stream even if I do not like those subjects but want to pursue law in the future?,"Hi, I'll be going to JC1 this year. Pretty soon I need to choose my subject combination. In terms of what I want to do in the future, I am undecided between Law and computer science/engineering. I'm leaning towards law right now the but the problem is I do not enjoy studying subjects like literature and while I enjoy History, I don't think I will be able to/want to cope with that much memorisation again for another 2 years. I am more of a science student, in fact I am even considering taking Computing and Physics if I go into the science stream.

So in essence,

1) Is it necessary for me to take the Arts stream to go into law in uni and beyond?

2) Is it worthwhile for me to take a stream I may not particularly enjoy if it means it could increase my chances of getting a course I like in Uni

3) By when should I decide if I should lock myself into arts (law) or science (computer science)? Or is that not necessary?

I think the question was okay (or so I thought), but I think the topic was manageable to most?? 

My experience :
To be honest, I expected environment since past years were all roughly about environment, so I was sort of stunned at first but still pulled through. I thought maybe since it has been environment, so it should follow suit but nope. The 2 examiners were okAy? Like they were pretty chill (?), so it was all good and I became less nervous as it went on (surprising because my anxiety is TERRIBLE) but yea oral is over!

Many of my friends who were not academical gifted as others went to ITE route and are currently enjoying what they do. I've also meet many students in polytechnic who were originally from ITE and are performing extremely well.

746,[A-Levels] Wanted to repost this useful compilation of results from the various JCs!,"Hello everyone!! Since the O-Level results are out and many of you must be pondering endlessly about where to go, I chanced upon this post from a fellow reddit user who compiled the performance of the various JCs in the 2019 A-Level examinations! I think it’s definitely an important factor to consider the academic performance of the school as ultimately you would be undergoing the school’s education and taking the A-Levels under their guidance.

I’ll leave it here! Credits to the original post, it was very detailed and insightful :))

*National Performance of JCs*

1. Raffles Institution (RI)/ Hwa Chong Institution (HCI) (Mean: around 85.5, ~25% of the batch scored 90 rp)
2. Dunman High School (DHS) (Median: 85, Mean: 83, 4 in 7 scored 85 rp and above, 16% (57 students) scored 90 rp)
3. Victoria Junior College (VJC) (Median: 85, 11% (91 students) scored 90 rp)
4. National Junior College (NJC) (Median: 84)
(I would place NYJC about here based on limited information from alumni and school)
5. Eunoia Junior College (EJC) (Median: 83)/ Temasek Junior College (TJC) (Median: 83, Mean: 80)
(I would place RVHS about here based on the limited information from the website)
6. Anglo-Chinese Junior College (ACJC) (Mean: 79.2)
7. Anderson-Serangoon Junior College (ASRJC) (Mean: 75.4)
8. Jurong Pioneer Junior College (JPJC) (Mean: 71-72)
9. Tampines-Meridian Junior College (TMJC) (Mean: 71)
10. Millenia Institute (MI) (Median: 67.5)
11. Catholic Junior College (CJC) (Mean/Median: around 60s according to alumni, 54 students who scored 85 and above, Arts Stream mean 80)
12. Yishun Innova Junior College (YIJC) (Mean: 62.56)


Schools without info: NYJC, RVHS (not complete info), SAJC 

Note that DHS and RVHS have not begun accepting JAE students as of the 2019 J2 batch hence their batches are fully IP for this set of results. 

Note that the maximum attainable university admission score (uas) is 90. Law, medicine and CS require 85-90 nowadays or even higher.

749,[O LEVELS] maintaining sanity and focus after papers,"Hey guys and girls who are taking their Os and As this year,first of all,all the best:)You’ve studied hard and gave it your best,give it your all during the paper and trust that you will do well.Grades don’t define your future,what you do after getting your results do.

Anyways this is just 1 tip for how to continue the drive and push harder on the pedal after your papers.Please please please do not stay back and discuss the answers or look through any answer sheet posted,it WILL mess with you mentally.After the paper ends and you are released,BOLT to the holding room and get your belongings and jet out of your school.Ideally,put on your ear piece and keep your head down,don’t try to make eye contact with anyone in the school.If you have a large clique of friends,this is the period of time to not leave school with them IF they are those types that discuss answers.Really,the human mind is a wonderful specimen,it can either help you or destroy you.Even if you scored 99/100 and you realised you made a mistake,your mind will ride off the fact that you made that mistake and not care about the 99/100 you got.So if you were to discuss answers or even look through answers,your subsequent papers will be disrupted because all you can think about is that you fucked it on that one paper(if you did).This won’t help if you have another or even 2 content heavy papers the next day and that’s a vortex of depression you are setting yourself up to.So whatever you do,never ever discuss or try to “mark” your paper after the paper ends.Let it be done and just push on for the other papers.Also if your class WhatsApp grp discusses answers after the paper,leave the group or just tell them to create another group and discuss in there.This 1.5months of exams is a battle between you and your mind,don’t let your mind win

750,[A Levels] just your average jc student struggling with meritocracy (and suicidal thoughts),"edit: i meant mediocrity\*\*\* omg what am i doing..

context: came from a mid-top jc and is an ip student, currently j2

not the most consistent student but ive been putting in substantial efforts in my studies since j1, doing tut before class & attempting some extra qns and i have tuitions also, did average in j1 but now in j2, my rp has been falling ever since j1 and somehow no matter how much i try, theres just so much undone work, i have piles and piles of extra revision ws and prelim papers undone when prelims are in a few weeks, i havent even fully mastered my content yet,,,nowadays i study until i want to give up already which is.... because i dont think i have studied that hard to slack off now, if people who are doing better than me are working harder than me, who am i to complain that im tired? sometimes im so stressed to the point just looking at my notes make me cry & other times im so calm and it scares me, i am taking breaks and stuff but i rlly cant find the motivation to push through & im so tired, i really dont want to do this anymore

also sometimes when waiting for traffic lights, some thoughts like just stepping onto the road flashes across my minds, or any other similar suicidal thoughts, while i do not act on them, these thoughts sometimes pass through my mind because i am so scared of not doing well for alevels when my parents have spent so much on tuition & they have so much faith in me, the thought of not doing well/ rej by the 2 unis scare me so much, i always joke say""kms"" jokingly but sometimes it rlly does cross my mind

throughout these 2 years i have had friendship and relationship problems which kind of still bother me till now, esp the rs problem which happened this year & it is truly annoying because everyday i think about it even though i tell myself i am over & it does take a mental and emotional toll on me

lastly, would just like to ask j2 students how long do u guys study during the weekends so i can get a gauge of how much more i should try to push myself (if i somehow can find motivation) ik everyone is diff some im just asking to roughly estimate the hours

752,[JC] i want to help my friend,"just wanted a third person pov on this

i have this friend. he is a J1, isn't your conventional play hard work hard student that you can easily find in any JC. Rather, he is really not putting in any effort in his studies, failing/passing on the dot all his tests. He had his A levels chinese oral and LC sometime back, and for both of it, he only realised he was sitting for the paper on the day itself. And the truth is, he really isn't *that* great in his chinese, or any of his subjects to the point where he doesn't need to study for it. He complains that he is tired bc he sleeps at the unholiest hours of the night, and simply decides not to go to school the next day because he is 'tired', this had already happened many times. And the fact that he did not stay up to do work, but rather spent his time procrastinating and wasting hours on youtube and tiktok instead of sleeping and waking up early for school is really quite concerning. He is really not putting in any effort in his studies, to the point where I believe that he is just ill disciplined. I know that his family does not place any stress on his studies since young. 

&#x200B;

I probably sound like some busybody wanting to interfere in someone else's life, but please trust me when i say that i sincerely care for him and really do not think this is how a student should behave. moreover, his promos are in around 2 months time. i usually do not bother about others when they don't give two shits about their work as i really don't have the prerogative, time or energy to do anything, but this is my friend. I really want to help him and just tell him to wake up from his daydream of thinking that JC is a walk in the park, which is evidently not the case. I have told him to study harder and go to school bc you have to, not just you feel like it, but I felt that by directly calling him out to start taking more responsibility for himself and his future would be pretty harsh, or just downright mean, so do other fellow redditors have any idea how i can help my friend out? i know for a fact that he is capable of so much more if he had tried.

edit: really didn’t expect so many responses and i really dk how to express my thanks without sounding a tad bit repetitive and insincere but i mean every thank you :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i42nnp/jc_i_want_to_help_my_friend/,True,2020-08-06 02:09:53

754,[A Levels] Stay strong to everyone studying,"Hello everyone!

“Don’t let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do. “ -John R. Wooden

Don’t forget about what you can do and achieve 
just because of things you can’t seem to complete/ achieve. For example, you have studied chapters 1-8 but you are stuck at chapter 9, please do not think “I can’t do it” “I am stupid”, because hey, you were able to understand 8 chapters! 

As a student, there are many ups and downs that we face. Sometimes, the ‘downs’ seem to be never ending that you forget about the ‘ups’, and you feel like giving up. I just wanna tell you that no matter what are the “downs” that you may be facing right now, you are not alone and you are stronger than you think. 

While you are reading this post, I just hope you can think of a time when you have your ‘ups’, and smile because you have achieved it. And I’m sure you will soon overcome the difficulties. 

All the best to everyone studying!! You are amazing and unique in your own ways and I hope you will remind yourself of happy times too!! ☺️",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0328v/a_levels_stay_strong_to_everyone_studying/,True,2020-06-10 19:41:50

759,[JC] Comparison of Cut-Off Points of JAE 2019 to 2020,"Hello, so, after seeing the positive reception that my [Polytechnic Comparison of Cut-Off Points of JAE 2019 to JAE 2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f058wj/poly_comparison_of_cutoff_points_of_jae_2019_to/) (now updated with new percentage data!) spreadsheet received, I thought I would do a Junior College edition too, seeing which streams from which JCs **increased** in cut-off points, (e.g. 11 to 12) and which **decreased** (e.g. 12 to 11). After spending some time, my thoughts can be summed up in 5 words, a not-so-nice synonym for poop.

[Take a look.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1C5Jolbfc3EJO9ICeqhzrbSjtvHnW6pQd5-YVLmh_wDY/edit#gid=921640009)

* Among the *34* different options for JC (counting each stream as a separate option), *18* had **no change** in points (*52.94%* of total no. of options), *14* **decreased** in points (*41.18%* of total no. of options), and only *2* **increased** (5.88% of total no. of options).
* *7* of both Art and Science streams (*43.75%* of the total no. of Art or Science streams, that being 16) across all the JCs contribute to the 14 options that **decreased** in points.
* The Science stream from *Victoria JC* and *Yishun Innova JC* contribute to the *2* options that **increased** in points, with Victoria JC’s going from 6 to 7 and Yishun Innova JC’s going from 19 to 20.
* All options that **decreased** in points only did so by *1* point. The only exception is Eunoia JC, with both its streams **decreasing** by *2* points.
* **No changes** have occured with International Baccalaureate options.

Conclusions:

Across the board, almost every single JC either decreased the cut-off point for an option or no changes have occured with an option. This means that most JCs have either gotten harder to get into, or remain as hard as before to enter. An interesting, albeit sad, observation is that 0% of Art stream options have gotten easier to get into.

Not all hope is lost however, the single thread of silver lining is that at least the JCs that are decreasing, are only doing so by 1 point.

Feel free to look at the data yourself and comment on your thoughts on this data. I'm especially curious about any theories you guys might have about why such a clear trend can be identified.

i was an express student but failed Os in 2019 and am studying in ite rn. at the same time i am doing o levels once again as a private candidate retaking 5 subjects this year. my fam was totally against the idea, saying i won’t be able to cope. in the end i had to use my money (which is a lot to me and luckily i had my salary that i saved up) to retake Os once again. 

my ultimate goal is JC ever since the beginning. i know some people will say “why don’t u just continue with ite and go to a good course in poly since it’s obvious that ure incapable of going there in the first place” i thought that was starting to be true at first, but coming to ite has made me realised that i’m not a computer person but am more to books side. so i’m thankful that i retook Os in the first place so that if i do well, i can leave ite and go to a jc. 

the reason why i chose to go ite and retake is bcs in the beginning, i wasn’t sure if pure hist is offered (they won’t offer a subject if there’s less than 20 candidates sitting) i needed it if i want to go jc to help my l1r5 (i cant retake art again and i have mt w me) but i would only know in june once the entry proof is out, which means by then if i were in ite i would b halfway thru sch. but if im not, then it’ll be a year wasted for me. 

throughout my years in secondary school, i did not study at all. my results were average and i only went with the flow. it was only when i failed my Os in 2019 suddenly hits me to do better and work harder. i didn’t prioritise my education, and allow rs to get in the way which affected my studies. there were no restrictions set or anybody to push me or scold me to do better. all the decisions in my life are up to me to decide. i’m free to do whatever i want ever since my dad passed on. 

i wish i had somebody to push me for my future sake u know? i realised its important now and its starting to kill me deep down. i regret taking things for granted and going with the flow. 

going to ite has made me realised an effective studying method that works for me which i have been using since august till now to study for Os.

only until the recent weeks where i started to feel more stressed and blanked out more easily. there were so many things to cope, idk where i stood, and i was all alone. it’s so scary retaking Os as a private candidate. and at the same time it sucks big time seeing ur friends happy with their choices in poly ite or jc. 

on top of that, i have financial expenses to worry about. i’m sick of my fam always bringing up about financial issues like topping up ez link card or buying food to eat (if i were to ask for $$) if i were to go ite and then to poly, i would have to spend so much which i really don’t want to. the only money i’m left with is my father’s wealth that he left behind. and as u know time goes, it’s only decreasing. yes, whenever i go out to school or purchase anything, i only depend on that and have stopped asking my mother for $$ majority of the times. it has been 4 years and i’m rly stressed thinking abt it once it runs out. 

i really don’t know what to do now. i’m really lost at this point and the fact that my geog paper is in about 2hrs+ really scares me. i feel alone and like a complete failure and a loser. i thought i could actually turn things around and prove people wrong by going to a jc next year, but regardless of whatever i do i feel like it’s never enough. 

i missed 1 week (to study n focus on Os) and applied 2 weeks of leave from ite bcs of Os which means i missed out so much. my attendance and studies r gg to b affected, and it’ll affect my gpa if i’m still in the sch next year. it’s really embarrassing if i were to stay in school next year aft everything. 

shld i leave ite next year and retake Os once again? i’m really desperate to get straight As on the slip. idk why. i just want to achieve that. 

besides dealing with the label of being a failure bcs i failed Os, i have to deal with worries like $$ and my future. i have to make decisions on my own. my father isn’t here to support me just like how he provided for my siblings. it’s different for me. i’m all alone. i have to decide and do things alone and honestly it’s been so tough. it’s been so hard ever since he left bcs there’s nobody to provide for me like how he did for my siblings when they were my age. it rly sucks having to live a diff life from ur siblings when they were ur age. 

i apologise if it’s confusing, if it sounds like i’m seeking pity. but i’m not the type to share my burdens to my friends or family (ik in this case it’s ironic) bcs i’m the type to keep my shit to myself. but this time round, it’s a different kind of pain. i have never felt this way before. it’s so overwhelming, it hurts, i’m desperate for success, i feel alone, and everything sucks. 

i really don’t know what to do at this point. i’m so confused and lost and i don’t know what is happening. i’ve never thought of sui**** but honestly it seems like a good option too. my fam would have one less mouth to feed anyways. 

i’ve tried so hard to get to where i want to, but even after everything that i’ve been through, it looks like it was all just useless.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jitejs/rant_o_level_as_a_private_candidate/,True,2020-10-27 19:01:30

770,[Uni] SMU PPS Interview Experience,"Hello! I have just completed my SMU PPS (Psychology, Political Science and Sociology) interview. I have decided to pen down my interview process in hopes of helping someone else that might need to go through the same interview down the road. I understand that I only took this interview pretty late so many people have already done this so this post might not even help much.  
\----  
**Interview details:**  
\- The interview was online via Zoom.  
\- As requested by the SMU admissions team, I logged in 15 minutes earlier. I was met with a sign that said that authorised people would let me in soon. I am not sure what happened but for some reason, I was let into the ""chatroom"" 10 minutes earlier than expected and came face to face with the admission guy from SMU. I wasn't ready at the point of time and neither was him. It was pretty awkward and he politely apologised and let me out.  
**My point being:** The moment you sit in front of the computer, please don't do something weird. You never know when you might come **face to face** with the admissions person even if its way before your interview time.  
(Also, that guy knew my name so I was shook.)

\- In total, there were **2 interviewers** and **3 interviewees** (including myself).  
\- One of the interviewers would talk more than the other. The latter had to be cued before she started talking. I guess she was more of the observing type.  
\- The interviewers are both very friendly. If you are the introverted type, do not worry. The 2 other interviewees were really silent and introverted but they got prompted to talk by the interviewers! Therefore, the other 2 interviewees did their fair share of sharing their thoughts as well.  
\- The interviewers would ask you to **introduce yourself first.** From my experience, you don't merely just say your name. You need to include **more information about yourself.** I would suggest sharing why you chose PPS. **All 3** of us interviewees shared our own perspective of the course.  
\- The interviewers then gave us a topic that is happening in the world to talk about. The three interviewees would share their own perspectives. From my experience, if someone didn't talk that much, the interviewers would cue that person by asking her / him to comment on something the other 2 interviewees mentioned. **Please don't be nervous when the interviewers do that.** They are really friendly.  
\- Then based on things mentioned by the interviewees, they will give you a second question to answer.  
\- At last, they will answer **any questions** that any of us had about SMU or the course. Just relax and ask!

Overall, my interview started at 2p.m. sharp and ended at 2.18p.m. sharp.  
**18 minutes in total!**

Dress Code:  
\- **Shirt with collar is preferred.**  
\- I wore short shorts so it wasn't that formal. Afterall, they don't see what you wear as your bottoms. HAHA.

All the best for anyone doing this soon! Don't worry. I think this interview will go well for anyone who is calm and collected and have the ability to think fast.  


\------------

I'd also like to thank that fellow person on reddit that shared with me about his experience for the interview. It helped me a great deal and I am happy to be sharing mine. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g2ekhy/uni_smu_pps_interview_experience/,True,2020-04-17 05:08:03

773,[Rant] should MOE offer Chinese dialects as 3rd language ?,"Hi! I realised nobody in this sub Reddit has pointed this out but after reading the rant about Singapore’s Chinese standard I’m thus inspired to point this out. In case you don’t know Singapore’s education system does not offer chinese  dialect at all. In fact since the 20th century the government has expressed their distaste over singaporeans conversing in dialects due to the language barriers between Chinese ppl that will fester. We have to admit those days are long gone and in fact most of our  youths do not even know how to converse or understand the dialects our elderly converse in daily. 

To make the education system more pratical our government chose mandarin to be our common Chinese dialect totally disregarding the others such as Teochew, Hokkien and Cantonese. Going a little bit out fo context here in the Chinese post which I had alluded to earlier, many had left comments of how we learn Chinese because our cultural roots. Isn’t this the same for our dialects ? Because of the government’s disregard for it they are letting our dialects die, and soon not or later when generations past our culture will die along it will it not ? 

I am not saying chinese is unimportant in anyways. Chinese is important due to the many opportunities we will receive when we interact with our Chinese National counterparts. I’m just stating that the government should not disregard our dialects due to reasons such as it not being impractical at all because so few people speak it. I believe it should be offered as a 3rd language in which students can take up if they are interested similar to how Bahasa Indonesian is offered at secondary school level. 

I’m one of the “rare” dialect speaker myself having learnt it since young (technically Teochew is my first language) but however I’m unable to read or write in it due to lack of a formal education in that language as opposed to mandarin. And as someone who had been exposed to the Teochew dialect since young I wouldn’t mind taking it as a 3rd language in secondary school. It’s sad to say that many of our youths do the understand the dialects at all (eg my class had only 2 ppl who can understand Chinese dialect) 

I really love to hear your thoughts thank you for reading  :D",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k0nf3i/rant_should_moe_offer_chinese_dialects_as_3rd/,True,2020-11-25 23:15:57
774,[RANT] hell week and a levels,"Hell week has finished yayyy 

In my opinion it was definitely a shitshow, will not recommend again, want to go to JC1 when PW was all I had to worry about, where promos diD not determIne my university and life was more certain. Funtimes, enjoy ur time jc1s.

I don't even want to talk about what happened this week, with waking up at 6:00 am everyday, staring into the abyss that my life has become and packing my entry proof to go to school and sit for 2-3 hours.  

During the 2-3 hours, I spend my time wisely- planning, then replanning, and then telling myself I don't know for a million times, realising noones gonna save me, rereading the question out loud like my teacher does, imitating my teachers style of teaching and eventually write the answer (works when I am less tired) and when they say pens down, regret every decision I made.

Then, I immediately come out of the exam hall, walk away from every SINGLE person, open reddit to comfort myself a bit until I don't, and take the train away from my house in an active attempt to runway from home because of how much of a disappointment I am to my family.

Eventually, I come back home to study for the next paper and sleep for 10 min which becomes the next day and the cycle continued. I am throughly exhausted and on top of this I screwed up my exams, disappointed everyone around me, and of course cambRiDge. 

But at the end of this week, I didn't cry at all, I did horrendously for my papers, but after ever exam, I came out I felt so empty inside and just wanted to study for the next one rather then dwelling on whatever happened in that paper. 

Now, I know everyone must be thinking, this is long, imma go back to studying bio/econs, but oh well ur still here, hi, the significance of not crying is the fact that I feel complete apathy, I want to feel the pain after the exam, it means that I care enough to do well, but I think I became so overwhelmed with the pressure of A levels to the point of apathy and I can't feel it anymore. I feel I'm on autopilot and honestly I'm avoiding this situation: I'm avoiding ppl, my family, lashing out at everyone, running away from my house and just avoiding everything as much as possible. I have become a monster. And  the thing is everyone is NICE TO ME, like my parents, my TeAchers, thE scHoOl. I feel so guilty and awful but oh well, I can't feel it cause I AVOID IT and idk how to face it. I feel so numb, and delusional, and honestly running away from my problems. It's not like I'm doing it deliberately, its just a habit.

Oh well, idk guys, I don't know anymore, found out the world is a evil place and life is pain and suffering, and bad ppl get away with things (thanks gp politics for teaching me AND CAMBRIDGE does not care about the environment) so yea, heres the end of my rant.

775,[A Levels] Opinion on PW,"So recently mothership posted a post that questioned if we needed PW as an A level subject to learn how to do projects (https://www.google.com/amp/s/mothership.sg/2020/09/a-level-pw-commentary//amp). After reading this post I was curious about what others think and I have a few opinions to share too. 

Firstly, I do agree that PW has its value in which inherently the subject is trying to teach students how to work together to solve a real world problem. The skills involved such as analytical thinking and problem solving are useful in the working world today where the skills are invaluable to a job seeker. However, the real question now is does PW really teach these skills or is MOE just pegging a grade on something that cant be graded and should be learnt in a different manner?

This year's tasks are disruption and network. The project topic 17 year olds are expected to do is to identify ways to develop solutions to solve issues in this area which to me seems like a herculean task for 17 year olds. I mean after all if grown ups cant solve real world disruptions why would a teenager who is less exposed and has less resources be able to do so? It simply does not make sense. Furthermore as correctly pointed out by mothership, people do not go about solving issues by identifying keywords and then writing a 3000 words written report with a poster, presenting it to a bunch of examiners and then getting your work destroyed for confidentiality purposes. That would just be an inefficient allocation of resources.

PW hopes to prepare students for life long learning and the challenges ahead. I can certainly see how I'm being prepared for the challenges ahead of dealing with an unreasonable and overtly demanding superior but life long learning? Really? How many of us after going into the real world actually go ""Ah! There is a problem in that situation! Let me see how I can develop solutions in today's world to solve the issue and apply it to another area?"" To be honest if that's the case, I would think that the issues of long queues happening outside Macdonald's whenever a hello kitty promotion is out would have had a solution for it and would never appear in other scenarios. But correct me if I was wrong, was there not a certain long queue at a certain governmental event or maybe I'm hallucinating? 

I've heard many comments from people, especially adults, who have never had the pleasure of going through PW say well this is absolutely necessary for you to go through because you learn how to work with others. But growing up in a interconnected world (network for all you souls without a project yet) where even games teach you how to work together, are there not plenty of other ways to learn this skill? Plus frankly speaking if this subject really thought us how to work together the people who should take this subject arent the 17 year olds but rather the adults the 17 year olds listen to and learn from. 

Well here are some examples of how we can learn to work together including group projects in certain subjects. For starters, my school had us research together as a group on mergers and acquisitions for economics which firstly taught me how to work with others, secondly had some use as I was now more aware of the business world around me. Same goes for the other subjects. Even PE teaches us how to work together and trains our motor skills too. CCA is another key pillar which teaches this and allows students to develop holistically at the same time. Ultimately the question at hand to be considered is does teaching students how to work together really warrant an A level subject? Or are we so caught up in chasing for grades that even how well you can work with one another is something to be tested and given a score on.

Well I being a 17 year old only, wouldn't know any better would I? But one thing for sure is, PW to me is nothing but a disruption which I'll gladly use as a project topic if not for the fact that my teacher will definitely and gladly end me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j17dva/a_levels_opinion_on_pw/,True,2020-09-28 23:03:18
776,[rant] [actually not really] Pen reviews from a stationery expert,"As a self-proclaimed professional stationery expert, I’ve spent numerous years (since 2013) diligently researching and experimenting on the different assortment of pens that typical Singaporean students use! Now here I am to share a few with you! 

##pilot juice (not up)
A little scratchy in my opinion, made writing uncomfortable along with the frequent railroading. Ink is quite inconsistent. Its only if you’re lucky that you get the one that lasts till the last drop of ink. One drop of this pen and say goodbye (cues rick roll)  4/10 the grip is fairly comfortable, the refills have a wide range of colours, quite ok design I suppose. 

##zebra sarasa 
I think I’m not wrong to say that everyone has used this at least once in your lifetime.  Smooth, doesn’t break easily and has a nice grip. Quite like the design too (especially collaboration editions! Rn it’s Line Friends!) Comes in many different types too : 

>sarasa mark on— highlighter friendly! 

>sarasa study—really cute markings refill to show your studying journey with the pen HAHA

and lo and behold sarasa with mosquito repellent!1!1!1!2!!22!!2????? HHAHAA 
overall 10/10 not a bad choice at all! 0.4 is a decent size too

##pentel energel 💗💗
Now this... this is the ultimate pen. Ink is REALLY smooth, and dries so so fast (you can highlight over almost immediately!) Talk about the very comfy grip and the slick design of this pen!!! I write super fast with this too (source : I finished my history paper) And the only bad thing about this pen is that the ink finishes quite fast hais... but definitely 11/10 would recommend! Really worth the investment :~)  Sometimes they have cute sakura or koi fish designs and the shell is very shiny ✨

##uniball signo DX cap / RT clicker 
Aesthetic look :3 Ink really smooth as well, hardly any railroading. Writing experience is quite pleasant! However the grip part is a little wonky and falls off after awhile :( In addition to that, unless you’re a careful person, don’t get this pen — once dropped it’s gone. Careless me has accidentally broken a few due to this and it’s very saddening you know... ;;____;; but still 7/10 not too bad I guess. 

总而言之 (to summarise), these are only 4 out of the 92728273333637373  I’ve tested! All these pens are 100% refillable — let’s be eco friendly!!!! :) comes in those value packs, definitely affordable 

I hope that you’ve gained better insights from this post on the qua(lit)y pens out there HAHAHA 

Edit : this is really based off my personal experience (and is quite bias) You are entitled to your own opinion which I fully respect :~) do drop some of your reviews of any pen! let’s take a break and have a chat",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iy6cko/rant_actually_not_really_pen_reviews_from_a/,True,2020-09-24 00:34:58

778,[JC] CJC SUCKS OH MY GOD (READ BELOW FIRST),"See how quick that got your attention? The common act of ""cancel culture"" (I would say) of going against a school is absurd, especially towards CJ. Now I really want to ask, by commenting on how ""bad"" the school is, are you really doing CJ justice? Just what exactly do you gain from such criticism? Yes your experience may not be the best here in the past/present, but think about current and future batches. The constant rumour of ""toxic"" culture has done nothing but put CJ in a bad light, and in fact, even though I myself am not fully sure, but CJ to most of us is doing averagely well, and what school doesn't have a fair share/balance of toxicity? Of course I'm not saying having toxicity is good, but CJ is definitely not the only school with a few disobedient teens. Not mentioning other schools, but really what is there to get from destroying a school's reputation? Imagine applying to a job and your resume includes your graduation from CJC, and before you know it, all the memories of people criticising a school that you actually liked refreshes and anyone who is from CJ is doomed. Look, I get some of your frustrations, but you're not giving this school a chance to change if you keep demolishing its image like this. Yes there are old facilities that are slowly being replaced, yes there are notes that may be a bit outdated, and yes there are some students who are just a pain in the ass, but which school has a perfect reputation? Do you ever find out what's going on there? And how about CJ? Any feedback done to reach the year head or principal and actually get their response? Honestly, I don't think so either. So instead of just complaining about how ""bad"" ANY school is, think about yours and others' perspective, and what really is the best decision. I'm not defending CJ, I'm defending ALL schools from hatred and constant criticism, because it's ironic that you graduated from there, and having chosen the school you wish to go, you decide to just keep criticising with a stubborn mind. Give the school a chance to change, give it some time, let it take a break from all this and watch them revive with better cultures and education quality. That being said, if you have any questions on CJ, I am available for TRUTHFUL responses, and yes of course there are areas for improvement for CJ, and should anyone decide to keep up degrading any school, then you are just childish and stubborn, that's it. To all those applying for JC/Poly/ITE, I hope you get the choice/course that you want, all the best.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kvqmts/jc_cjc_sucks_oh_my_god_read_below_first/,True,2021-01-13 04:20:28

782,[Rant] Does psle really matter?,"
This isnt going to be a rant completely. I just realised how cruel having 12 year old children go through a national exam that will in one way or another decide the future of one in singapore. those who are late bloomers end up being disadvantaged and in the end become limited and not be developed to their fullest potential. Is psle really a necessary examination? Is is appropriate to stress students at such a young age where enjoying life should be a main priority? I personally didnt do well in psle and was quite shocked by the results i got negatively so this view may be quite biased. If you guys dont mind, can you share with me your PSLE results and O/N Level results or even A level results as i am curious to find out psle even matters as it all does it put uneccessary stress on students on a young age and whether if late bloomers were at a disadvantage.

786,[A Levels] H2 Chem P4 Preparations,"2 days to H2 Chem P4, so i thought i can share something here on what to prepare:

 \[disclaimer\] These are purely my personal opinion on what might be coming out, by looking at the past 3 years of 9729 P4 and international A level papers.  


Energetics: so far thermometric titration has not come out yet, do get familiar with it. Temperature correction came out for the past 3 years, i doubt there will be a fourth.   


Kinetics: continuous method has been quite frequently tested as well, came out in 2017 expt and 2019 planning, most likely won't make an appearance again. Possibly initial rate expt, like iodine clock expt, so far, only sulfur clock came out in 2018.  


QA: QA will take a different form this year as transition metal has been taken out. But there is no guarantee that transition metal ions won't be tested. we may not need to identify the TM cations, but they can ask us about the properties of solutions of TM ions. e.g. solutions of Fe3+ is acidic, Zn can be a reducing agent, etc. i think organic QA will come out again, since it made an appearance in 2019.  


Also, i am expecting plan and perform experiment to come out again this year. Maybe identify non-TM cations?  


Planning qn: i don't think kinetics will be in planning since it has come out twice in 2017 and 2019. energetics, organic QA or polyprotic titration (with sketching of titration curve) might be possible.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j9inle/a_levels_h2_chem_p4_preparations/,True,2020-10-12 18:31:37

793,[O Levels] not exactly a rant but,"

Hi! So for the last two years I’ve been planning on going to the same jc or rather go to jc with two of my friends in my group of about 7 of us . Up until prelims , the goal seemed really possible because we all had around the same l1R5 as each other and so we were all kind of confident of getting into tmjc . Plus , after each and every paper they were both saying how easy the papers were and how confident they were of their results and I felt a bit down cos based on how they described it I felt I didn’t do well lah . But , on the 13th of jan this all changed . Backstory , their names all start with e and f while mine starts with g so obviously they collect their results first . The minute they opened their result slip , they started crying and I was equally nervous for myself as well as for them . I peeked over person number 1s results and I saw 26 points for l1r5 and 19 for l1r4 , I was shocked but not as shocked yet . Backstory again , I’m sorry , person number 1 was arguably the “weakest “ at studies amongst the three of us even though we take different coursework subjects ( we only have 6 subjects mind you )  so while it was shocking to see her points it wasn’t as shocking as person number 2 . Person number 2  spent 3 years of his school life playing around but he woke up in Sec 4 and he’s actually really smart and people thought he was gonna get single digits . He was the most confident of his results than any of us particularly because small flex but I was always the strongest in English in our class and he had beaten me once during myes and he was comparing English p2 answers with me and everything was roughly the same so it came as a shock when he opened his envelope and saw a c5 for English and an l1r5 of 24 and an l1r4 of 18 , meaning they both couldn’t qualify for jc . At this stage , I was on the verge of crying because I thought I would do worse . Fast forward 5 minutes I was crying too because I didn’t meet my goal but I could qualify for jc with a raw of 16 and nett of 14 ( not exactly optimal ) and my first choice is the jc we were all planning to go to since the beginning . With Jae posting results out this Tuesday , I feel really bad that I had so called “abandoned “ my friends on this journey because we did kinda tell each other we would go anywhere together . 

P



P./ I’m sorry for my bad punctuation . But yeah , I’m not confident of getting into tmjc as well but I’d probably end up in jc anyway",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ex9m81/o_levels_not_exactly_a_rant_but/,True,2020-02-02 09:37:12

797,[O Levels] A few words of encouragement to those taking O levels tomorrow and next few weeks,"Hey graduating students of 2020, I am a senior that took O levels in 2019 and currently studying in polytechnic. I know all of you are nervous for the papers, especially since it starts tmr and you have all put in so much effort for it, if you didn’t it’s ok, pace yourself well and do your best, no point regretting.
 
So I know you all are busy doing final revisions and preparations so all I just wanna say is that O levels is not a life and death matter and you should not worry too much about the results. You all worked so hard and sacrificed a lot for this exam, don’t give up now. Another thing about the papers is that no matter how easy or hard you feel the paper is, there is moderation, so don’t think of failing if it feels very hard, the Cambridge markers will sort out the grades. The last tip I have is not to discuss the answers and questions with your peers, no matter how tempting it may be as it will really affect your mood for the next paper.

800,[Uni] Laptop Models Recommendation,"Edit: My friend and I compiled a[ list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xHOmWpWegtK_RzQFB4CzQQ1P2AAG7GvUg37WUAG0iuE/edit) of laptops recommended by some of you! Thank you for the help! (these are laptops that we have shortlisted, so if you are unhappy with the list... create your own? no hate pls) 

Hi! I am going to be doing programming and was wondering if there are specific models that you guys recommend. I’m completely new to this programming thing but I have done my research and my specs preference (?) is 16gb ram, 512gb ssd, 10th gen i5/i7 intel core. However, there are many laptops of such specs on the market (many are customisable.. even mac), I’m clueless as to what to get while being on a budget constraint. 

For example, I read that Acer has a bad reputation in the IT sector (???) but I see schools recommending Acer. Hence, while certain models of Acer seem to fit my demands, I feel apprehensive about getting it.. 

Other brands like Lenovo have way too many different models that honestly I’m just 🤯 

I would really appreciate if you guys have specific models that you want to recommend that not only fits the specs requirement but is also light, and sleek (am I too demanding LOL) and is less than $2000. And also durable enough to last me 4 years... 

(Currently I’m looking at Acer Swift3 w specs of 1tb ssd, i5 intel core, 16gb ram but I read reviews that it overheats way too quickly and also because Acer :/ as aforementioned I’m not sure if it’s good.)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hoin4o/uni_laptop_models_recommendation/,True,2020-07-10 20:41:31
801,[A Levels] demoralised after block tests and unmotivated,"So my block tests (mid term results) arent good with math E and most likely my other results (phy, econs, chem) will fall under mostly Ds and Es or one C. Any seniors from hc were in the same situation? How did you guys fare for A levels in the end? No matter how much i studied during the june hols nothing seemed to get into my head which is rather upsetting. Idk whether hcs papers are much harder hence maybe i should not feel as bad or sth. I have no intention to be elitist or anything but i genuinely feel damn depressed now. Thanks and hope some seniors can help

Edit: are there any seniors who were in the 20-40 percentile? Most of my subjects fall under that range based on last yr promos alone, but my other scores managed to pull my overall to 40-60.

Seems like the topics being removed are large topics that are supposedly easier... Heard that the increase in weightage for other topics is likely to harm our grades instead of helping us :( I really don't see the point in removing the topics if we still have to learn them. Idk about other jcs, but my jc is on track to finish the syllabus on time despite HBL, and I think theres still enough time catch up after the may holidays

It feels like I've been working hard in order to do well for As for a really long time and I'm so scared by how everything has become so uncertain :( I kind of wish they would just cancel practical exams and leave the syllabus as it is",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/g6dl3q/a_levels_scared_about_removal_of_clts/,True,2020-04-23 17:15:48
803,[A Levels] Is it really true that most J1s fail their first Common Test?,"Even though it has only been a week since my timetable formally started, I'm already feeling the intensity of the workload. 

My chem and math lecturer was basically rapping and before I can process information they have already moved to another slide. Bio is no longer like secondary school bio where you can just memorise and identify in the question which part is needed to answer that question, and just spit it out; the questions are really much more understanding-based and I'm a lil intimidated by it. Econs is well...there arent any ""notes"" in the sense that you can memorise them and then spit that copy out in essays. Everything is so wordy almost like a textbook and I don't know how to answer a question at all :')

And I only have one tutorial for some subjects per week and I'm just worried that that isn't enough time for me clarify my doubts on how to do tutorials (50% can't do lol)

As someone who got straight As consistently throughout secondary school, I'm really worried about my performance for subsequent exams and promos (CANNOT afford to retain the sch fees are a killer).

Even though the jump in the difficulty of the subjects is huge, why is it that the ""norm"" is for J1s to do badly in their cts?

804,[O Levels] To the start of your new journey.,"Hey there! All you Secondary 4 Graduates. Today (it's 12:12 as I'm writing this), is the day when you receive your O' Level results. You've studied hard for the last 4 years and have undergone many intensive revision sessions, finished mock papers like crazy and pushed yourself to your limits to prepare for your O' Levels. 

Whatever the results may be, no matter what your aggregate is. Know that you've done your best, and whatever grade you receive is the fruit of your efforts that you've poured in daily. Enjoy the last month of your holidays and pick a course and school that is right for you. Never look back and regret, never think back and wonder ""what if I did this better?"". If you want to think back, find the positives and pick out ways you can improve on yourself for your tertiary education (If I do this better, I'll score better this year!). And most importantly, have passion for your course you've picked. You'll be studying for it for the next 2-3 years after all.

Remember, the grades you receive are not your future. They're simply keys that unlock the doorway in front of you, to walk your own path as you pursue your passion, and know that everyone here and those who love you will support any decision you make with what you have been given.

Good luck, my juniors. All the best for your result collection.

807,[Poly] Engineering Science at NP: COURSE REVIEW 👏👏,"Hi! I'm a graduate from NP Engineering Science (ES) and I thought I'd share my experience here. (Ngl I was inspired by a [prior post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hiogbx/uni_the_truth_about_nturep/) lol.) Hopefully we can start a trend where graduated seniors share their unbiased thoughts and experiences on their courses.

This post is intended for prospective students/juniors as a guide on what to expect from the course, beyond what the marketing materials will tell you. I'll try my best to be unbiased in my account and speak more of the experience of everyone generally, but of course, your mileage may still vary. Furthermore, there's been some changes to the programme since my cohort so take things here with a grain of salt.

**Setting expectations**

I regularly joke about how the course will not land you a job, but will land you a spot in uni. There's truth to that. The course broadly touches on mechanical, electrical, electronic engineering and programming, but it's all not enough for the real world despite graduating with a specialisation (though I heard those have been removed).

*""But doesn't that just make it a 3-year JC?""*

Ok if you put it that bluntly then yes. Everyone in the course qualifies for JC too. But the reasons for choosing ES range from having more hands-on projects to a more vibrant student life compared to mugging like O-levels all over again. Don't get me wrong, you'll still have exams, but not as much, and it's very manageable. Plus, go poly dunnid take Chinese mah.

**Academics**

ES focuses on research, evident from the research and development immersion project in year 2 and the final year project in year 3. You'll have a broad range of options for those, from in-house projects conducted in NP to attachment projects with NUS, NTU, or an industry partner.

Regarding the instruction and pedagogy, I don't think it varies that much from any other course. You'll have a mix of good lecturers and those you just can't understand, just like everyone else. ES does have its own exclusive modules, though, and they are very lenient. A couple of times they even changed the assessment weightages because we did so poorly for a test lol.

Grades-wise, maintaining A's with a few B's here and there is very manageable. In my batch, about half carried a GPA 3.8 or higher, and you don't need to mug too hard to achieve that. Those grades will land you a spot in most local uni engineering programmes. I suggest taking the time to join competitions, CCA's, hopefully take up a leadership position to boost your scholarship prospects. But of course, don't neglect your grades too much la hor.

**Scholarships**

The brochures gladly boast that ES has a higher percentage of students receiving scholarships from NP but I think that can be attributed to many of the students having single-digit O-levels. From my experience, I've seen that number shrink from 33% when I first came in, to 25%, now 18%.  But don't worry if you don't get those. Keep your eyes peeled for external scholarships offered by A\*Star, DSO, Singtel, M1 which often have better offers.

**Atmosphere/Student Life**

ES students are really tight-knit compared to other other courses because of its small batch size and dedicated project and study rooms just for us. You'll largely stick with the same class throughout your 3 years too.

You may have the impression that it's a competitive course, but which course isn't? ES just has more nerds in it. Despite that, I never sensed any crab mentality in the course so you shouldn't really worry about it. Everyone has the same goal of uni anyway.

Outside of ES, people tend to have vibrant student lives too, participating actively in CCAs. I count 3 club presidents in my class alone, and it's not uncommon for people to hold EXCO roles.

**Overseas trips**

My batch was a lucky one. We went on the last 3D2N orientation programme conducted in a Bintan resort, fully paid-for (not kidding). We also had a 2-week study trip in Japan, though that we had to pay for and we didn't clear any modules, pretty much everyone went there to have fun. The cohort after me had a longer immersion programme in China, though. I can't speak for that but they did clear a module or two.

**Changes**

Since my batch, there's been a quite a few changes to the programme. Other than those I've mentioned, new batches now have a data AI/machine learning module (which I wish I had), and now students have the option of going for internship instead of doing a final year project.

**Prospects**

Like I said, this course pretty much just primes you for uni, and alums end up in a diverse range of engineering programmes. But what's interesting is the sheer number of people opting to go to SUTD. I count 7 out of my 60 batchmates, and that's only the ones I know. Not bad for a new uni.

**Conclusion**

Overall, I rate this course 8.5/10. Short of a perfect score because my batch had some modules of questionable relevance and we didn't proper overseas exchange programme, though I think those have been addressed for future batches. Generally, I believe my peers are satisfied with the course too.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hl1msn/poly_engineering_science_at_np_course_review/,True,2020-07-05 03:08:30

i js find it so unfair. to say that you scored b3 for everyth, for your pure sci, pure humans, that sounds decent! it’s alright, pretty gd, not bad (i mean ofc to score an a1 or a2 is a dream!!! but b3 is js avg) but omg to say that ur raw l1r5 is 18 sounds so demotivating and demoralising. it js isn’t fair and it’s honestly rlly sad. it’s only 2 more marks away from a 20. and if u r a student aiming to go to jc, the choices are js so limited, like sure there’s yijc or mi but it js doesn’t stick if u know what i mean and if u r a student aiming to go poly, the choices r again limited. u cant go to a fantastic course if u know what i mean. 

and it’s js so disheartening and it makes people feel so lost and uncertain. is it so wrong that i’m consistently average? i’m sorry that i’m not consistently good or excellent academically. ahh. 

so i js wnna say that as a student who thought that my grades cld improve or sustain from prelims to os and who scored mostly b3s, to those in the same boat as me - i feel you. i rlly do. i got you. 

we got this. we’re gonna be okay.

I used to have a bad view on RP because of the way people talked about it — It didn’t have a good reputation.

But guess what? I entered RP. 

Now I know how wrong I was to assume that RP was a “bad poly.” I am sick and tired of seeing people’s faces when they hear that I am from RP. 

Yes, RP has its own flaws and all that. 
But it is a poly that I actually find pretty damn good. 
The learning approach isn’t that bad and facis are actually very helpful. 
In fact, I think I have learned so much more from PBL than from normal lectures (maybe its personal preference thing).
My class isn’t filled with slackers either... It is filled with people who actually want to do well.

I don’t know WHY rp has such a bad label on it (perhaps cause of the COP) but I want to assure anyone who is planning to eae/jae/jpae/dae into RP that it is actually a good school. Don’t be afraid of what people might be thinking about you when you become an RP student. Work hard, do well, achieve your goals. You will secure your spot in Uni as long as you work hard.
University doesn’t give 2 craps about what poly diploma you have BUT how high YOUR GPA is.

And to those who have a bad impression of RP, stop clowning your friends when they decide to apply into this school.

I am really kinda pissed whenever I hear people say “ITE North.” 
And honestly, what’s with people dragging ITE into this situation? All these are schools that are catered for learning & education and no one should be made fun of where they study at.

817,[Uni] SMU SOA Graduate offering to help with appeal letters + questions on SMU life + free notes,"Hello SGExams community!

Quick intro:   
Graduated from SMU School of Accountancy (SOA) in 2019, currently working in venture capital. Graduated with a magna cum laude with internship experience in IB, BCG, Big 4.   
Was in a few CCA's, did overseas and local exchange programmes, and more importantly, was a student interviewer for School of Accountancy freshman while I was a student.   


Just like the title says, I'm offering to assist anyone hoping to enter SMU with their appeal letters. I've been getting a few requests over the past few days/weeks from people who have read my past comments in this subreddit, and since I have quite a bit of spare time now, I'm offering to help anyone with their appeal letters. I'm not saying that the people I've helped have definitely gotten successful appeals, but I know of a few that I've helped over the past few years who have managed to be successful. I'm also willing to help anyone with any interviews to SMU you may have, since I know how most of these interviews are conducted (especially for SOA).

That being said, I am definitely **not** going to help you write the whole appeal letter. 

Additionally, if there are any incoming freshman who want to spend their free time learning basic finance concepts, I'm willing to share my notes with you guys as well, so just send a PM my way.

Lastly, if anyone has any questions about the BAcc curriculum or wants to ask me any questions about SMU life (Exchange/internships/CCA/etc) or about trying to enter IB/banking, feel free to shoot me any questions as well.

I was never inclined to those academically competitive courses like med/law/dentistry etc. My biggest goal in uni is to just do something that I really enjoy and one of my interest lie in criminology/psychology as I have aspired to join the SPF since I was young. Hence, I do want to join either FASS in NUS or SSS in NTU.

However, because of my parents opinions and stuff, I cant help but think about whether my grades will be a ""waste"" if I join these faculties because I do have a high chance to go into higher tier course like computing/business etc etc. also I know that there is alot of competition in FASS and that kind of turns me off a little but generally I still like the mods and the curriculum

what should I do? should I consider courses that are ""higher tier"" or should I just stick to something that I have more interest in for now? (saying this in itself is so problematic im so sorry)

also, can I ask how many FASS/SSS students apply for overseas uni for masters? or do students usually stay in SG unis to complete their masters for psych?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f94z4e/uni_90rp_applying_to_fasssss/,True,2020-02-25 20:57:56
819,[A Levels] Post results reflection on performance and JC journey !,"Before my As, I came across a post by a senior regarding his drastic jump from prelims to As. He said he would make it a point to come back and give an update irregardless of the outcome bah. 

And I swore to myself that I would do the same, kinda like an ode to my Jc + A level journey. 
So here’s my A level story !! My sub combi was BCMg. 

I went to a mid tier jc that was highly regarded for its Arts. ( u can prob Guess which jc alr ) 
I had a lot of probs motivating myself to studying. Bcuz by the end of J1, I knew that I was more suited for the arts but here I am, taking a science combi. 

My grades for subjects I was naturally stronger at dipped drastically after promos bcuz I lost that drive. ( studied damn hard a month prior to promos bcuz I didn’t wanna retain since I’m a PR , ended up w 68RP w/o PW ) 
In J2, things got so bad and I ended up being incredibly playful and lazy. By this point I didn’t do any tutorials, the ones I submitted - I copied from my friends. I’d study for a test maybe 1/2 days prior w/o my heart in it. 
It was incredibly hard to feel pressured to study bcuz this wasn’t what I wanted. The combi wasn’t what I would push myself to study for so I felt chill and nonchalant despite the lack of revision and my poor grades. 

I got UUU/D BA (BCM/g GP PW) for my prelims. So I had like what ? 25RP ? 
And then came my wake up call - The day after my last prelim paper. 

I realised I have this chance to sit for an exam and actually give it my best shot. What I’ll get in the end, I don’t know but I Know I really don’t wanna go through this stressful endeavour all over again. That was for sure. 

Since that day, I studied like 10 hours a day, and I booked 3 consults a week for chem since I’ve nvr gotten above an S. I don’t expect much bcuz I was a horrible student but I know I must give it my 100% to pull through and finish this marathon. I did my tys up to 2011 for chem since my teacher advised me to stop n consolidate instead. And I reviewed those papers 6+ times. 

All in all, in those 2 months leading up to As (after my prelims) , I had undergone the most arduous academic revision I’ve ever had. 
The stakes were v high and I honestly regret starting so so late from time to time. 
But I had to remind myself not to waste time by overthinking n mopping bcuz I srsly Had No time. 
It was my fault and my wrongdoing uh so had to suck thumb. 

So when I got back my results a few hours ago, I was damn happy. 
Happy and grateful that I can run and hug my respective tutors. Happy and grateful that I could text my mom and my private tutors w smiley face emojis. 

I didn’t do AMAZING. 
I got CCC/C AA !! So 72.25RP. 
I jumped by like 47RP from prelims.
^ and that brought tears to my eyes bcuz it was so incredibly painful and tiring. I came back after papers wondering if I can pull through and get a C or a D, wondering if I can get into a local Uni. 
Wondering how I’d find the funds to go overseas uni or worse case retake. And making eye contact w my parents would hurt a lot bcuz only towards the end I realised, for my situation , this exam was beyond me. What I put in, is gg affect my family one way or another. And I hated myself for being a shit student. 

But now that Im more reassured that I can get into where I want ( FASS ) and I don’t have to seek maybe longer routes to my end goal. 
I would say I’m content. 
Bcuz I worked bloody hard to get here. 
mmm if you’re a junior reading this, it’s never too early to start. U don’t have to Mug fcking hard, js dedicate 3 hours a day maybe, and you’ll be fine. Do ur tutorials and pick ur brain and discuss w tutors and friends. 
Rlly Enjoy ur jc journey n Make the most out of it bcuz it’s one hell of a wild ride .

824,[JC] Looking for a Study Buddy,"This is a throwaway account because I feel that my identity is at the verge of being exposed on my main account lmao + not really comfortable with my irl friends realising that I’m quite active on this Reddit LOL

So hey! As the title says, I am looking for a study buddy! I don’t have a problem with procrastination I just... get very very lonely when I study. I’m somebody who studies ok on their own but even better when it’s with somebody else, which is weird. Also, I kind of want to make new friends 👉👈

We don’t have to meet up irl if you don’t want to (tho I’m okay with meeting up if u want to) we can do it online instead! I just enjoy the company, if u feel uncomfortable u can always just mute your microphone and off your camera 🥳 If we meet irl I can chope seat for u or something lol

If you wish, we can also keep each other accountable by sending a list of what we did for the day to each other and motivate one another to be productive, mainly because I think it would be fun to keep track of progress and I don’t mind helping you out if ur smb who procrastinates hehe

Some background info: I’m a girl in J1, entering J2 in 2021 taking HELm (H2 hist, lit and econs and H1 math) We don’t have to take the same combi to be study buddies because as I said, I just enjoy the company when I study but just stating my combi because Idm helping u out with hist, lit and econs if it’s within my ability (I’ll try my best! Math... isn’t my forte even at H1 level yikes)

828,[A LEVELS] What are some basic studying methods for a failing student,"TLDR: why did i waste my childhood not studying whyyyyyyyy / confused teenager who should really know better would like some general studying tips


hi everyone, using a throwaway here because my main could be used to doxx me and that would be undesirable to say the least. I'd like to preface this by stating that this is somewhere between a rant and a desperate cry for help, and I should probably see a counselor regarding this, but other than that I'd really appreciate some advice regarding this :D


Some Background: I'm in J2 currently, and I've never had/prescribed to a ""proper"" method of studying before, and because of that I am in incredible torment :)


I've never had to keep to a consistent pace of studying, even for O levels I panic studied 2 months prior to the exam and somehow got single digits
My work ethic (with regards to schoolwork at least) is honestly, incredibly shoddy and its a miracle I've made it this far. 


I enjoy the hobbies I have and schoolwork was honestly never much of a priority to me, the enjoyment of my fleeting adolescence was (hence leading to said work ethic)


I barely managed to pass Promos and avoid being conditionally advanced (i  technically should have been but due to some weird loophole I didn't) and my MCTs were a dumpster fire (SUU/D). I only managed to pass my contrasting subject. I didn't study at all, due to a mixture of procrastination and feeling like however much I was going to study wasn't going to help at all.

A bit of a self-fulfilling prophecy, I know. Which brings me to the second part, procrastination

i'll provide an example: after showering one time, i pretty much just lied on my bed using my phone, without changing into clothes (and this is why im using a throwaway). Its not that i don't want to improve on this, i just can't find the drive for studying.  


Onto the actual question then: how exactly do I study? more specifically how do I get myself to study, and how do i adhere to it? Im honestly at a loss what to do, and I'm really unsure how to get myself to start. I really want to stop feeling like this, I just don't know how to take the first step.


Its like having sleep paralysis, there's like a mental block and i really do want to overcome this, but no matter what i do i just can't.

I showed up 30 mins early and it started 15 mins earlier than my scheduled time. Do go early. I also wore business casual. Some other girl was there in tshirt and pants. I recommend you dress better than that to make a good impression. Some other questions included was about how RP follows problem based learning and small classes.

833,[Junior College] Temasek JC and my experience,"so I am quite new to this sub, but I was scrolling thru and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jypcbo/junior_college_tjc_temasek_jc/) by u/cheapfoolscap on TJC so I thought maybe I can also share my experience in TJC, both the bad and the good. Feel free to ask anything by replying, or u can dm me.

this post is quite long but i did some signposting so hopefully its better

I'm a J1 (2020) student in TJC, taking PCME. I came from IP so this is from 5 yrs of experience haha

**My personal thoughts (differs for everyone but heres mine):**

The best part about TJC is probably the people. Everyone is in general nice and approachable. Absolutely no bullying or discrimination/xenophobia. Most of the teachers are also helpful and try their best to help. You'll usually do well or ok in TJC as long as u put in enough work. But the students call it TJail for a reason. you'll hear a lot of complaining from the people here. In short the school and some departments makes terrible decisions that no one likes, and stresses us out. some parts of tjc look so worn down like it has not been fixed since 1977. a lot of good teachers are also leaving the school. for legal reasons i cant list specifics but yeah.

**Here's a more unbiased overview of everything:**

**TJC facilities**, also adding on to the post from cheapfoolscap:

1. **In general**, tjc hasnt rlly changed facility wise for 5 years, save for that one basketball court they built, ^(sometimes i wonder where the school budget is going). some of the rooms, esp the classrooms, container classes and theaterette will look a bit... worn down. you'll see a bit of vandalism here n there, broken chair broken table, dirty floor. you can see cockroaches, lizards, millipedes here but it's not a common occurence. can't rlly blame them for not fixing all the stuff cuz tj is rebuilding in 2022, but it might be surprising to u because frm outside the school rlly doesn't look that bad.
2. **Canteen:** canteen food is... depends on ur preference lah, but u can get tired of it. we have a western stall, fruit juice stall, drinks + snack stall, japanese stall, korean stall, malay stall, cai fan stall. the korean stall sells very nice mushrooms
3. **Cafe:** the cafe is probably one of the nicer looking locations in tjc.  the food in my honest opinion is meh, and their food quality went down slightly over the years. also the food costs more
4. **Aircon:** air con is... not a guarantee. originally, the rule was that the air con will only be turned on at 9.30am/10.30am for regular classes. but recently with covid and everything we are technically not supposed to turn it on for a full class.
5. **Physical activities:** if u like physical activities then tj has quite a bit of facilities. we have very big rock wall, adventure tower, zipline, bball court, tennis court, volleyball court. sadly u may not get to touch the rock wall n adventure tower n zipline in j1.
6. **Printing shop:** the school has a printing shop called ZAP. it can print a3, color, b&w, photocopy n pretty much anything. it used to be run by a very nice elderly couple (^(which the school sadly replaced :()), but is now run by a few aunties. however the printing service is not very reliable, smtimes the printers break down n the queues are smtimes vv long (esp when 1 whole cohort is printing the same assignment last minute).
7. **Bookshop:** the school has like a mini popular. they accept popular card. sells stationery, school uni and stuff.
8. **Counselling:** the school also has some counselling service, like career guidance (ECG), normal counselling. never visited either, but i heard mixed reviews about both.

**TJC culture**

1. **Fitting in:** In TJC, as long as youre nice, youre good. generally no bullying happens here, the people are all very nice (really) n chill, so as long as youre helpful, do ur part in grp work, nice, u shld find ur place here. dw about making friends also, its honestly quite easy here.
2. **IP vs JAE, elitism and favoritism:** Among students, no one really cares if ur from IP or JAE, or care abt ur L1R5. IP kids wont go n make distinctions between jae and ip, after all we're all from the same school now. while the IP kids will usually already have their set friend groups and people they hang out with, alot of us are still very open to making new friends, knowing new people etc. A very small number of teachers will show favoritism to IP kids though, some are more blatant abt it than others. Academically, there will not be much disparity between JAE and IP. In general both cohorts have the same ability to do extremely well or fail everything, it really depends on how hard u work. so dont stress that youll be ""dumber"" than ur ip counterparts.
3. **Competitiveness:** Not competitive except for a small portion. 90% of the school focus on doing well themselves, rather than comparing too much to other people n trying to be ""the best"". there are competitive people who are aiming for top scorer n stuff, but in general tjc is one of the less competitive jcs out there. we are less competitive than vjc if that matters
4. **Mass dance and cheering:** Mass dance n cheering are a major part of TJ culture. some people find it annoying, some don't, but basically for every school event you'll have to do them.
5. **Social Hierachy:** Doesn't exist here.
6. **Rules:** School has rules ofc. The normal ones like neat uniform, no piercing other than ear, neat hair n stuff. TJC has a system of demerit points, u start at 100 every year, and they cut away at ur points as u break sch rules (latecoming etc), and u will have to go for detention. Since there's covid and theres no morning assembly, theres no more uniform check n so enforcement of rules is a bit less strict now. however, some teachers are more anal abt the rules and will give u demerit points for everything.
7. **Relationships/Sexual Orientation:** TJC people r generally vry open minded,  so if u r scared that u will get judged or discriminated against for being lgbtq+, dw abt it cuz u won't. relationships are not uncommon, though try not to flaunt it too much bc some people from school administration (Principal) strongly discourage BGR n might intervene.
8. **TJC teachers:** They are generally very helpful and genuinely want to help u do well. Some are more likeable than others. Some have different teaching styles that may or may not work for u. Some are however, really not good and very unlikeable, and will make your experience very unpleasant. You may want to check with ur seniors or ip friends on which ones to avoid.
9. **TJC administrative body:** Honestly, they are very out of touch with the student body. sometimes makes dumb decisions that no one asked for.

**Studying @ TJC:**

1. **Workload:** Differs per subject, but if youre taking 4H2 expect quite a bit. Usually u r given 2 day deadlines (chemistry tutorial, math tutorial), or a week (econs essays, csq). it can get overwhelming, cuz some subjects will introduce new concepts and be more confusing (esp physics and chem). u will definitely need to take special care of ur mental health and work very hard.
2. **Facilities:** There's the library n cafe, or under lecture theatre. Plenty of spots to sit and study.
3. **Opportunities:** TJC does have programs that you can sign up for, as well as H3 subject options in JC 2. however, unless ur doing reasonably well in school, u wont get in. the school quite frankly doesnt offer u any external learning opportunities if u do badly academically.
4. **Promotion criteria and retaining**: In general, it is quite hard to get retained in TJC. you'll have to do very, very badly, like straight Us and Ss. to promote ull need 2H2 and 1H1 subject passes (E grade).

In conclusion, i wouldnt go as far as to say ""avoid tj"", but youll have to weigh the pros and cons if ur planning to come here. i personally made a lot of good friends and learnt new stuff, even though my experience at tjc isnt perfect. if u want a less competitive environment with nice people that can still help u get good results, then tjc might be the school for you.

I don't want this post to be too long so i'll stop here, but if u wanna ask any specific questions then feel free

834,[O Levels] Reasons why your Literature essays are not getting high marks and how to improve from there,"*(These tips can be used by both N/O Levels students)*

I took Elective Lit last year for my N Levels and was able to score A1 for my combined humans so I thought I would like to share some reasons on why your essays might not be getting the desired score and how to improve from there. These are tips I shared to someone last year on this sub reddit but I shall post it again for convenience :)

My literature has always been fluctuating from around A2 to C6 since sec 3, but I did know why my grades kept on drastically dropping, and thats because of time management. However after going for lit consults with my teacher, I realised time management wasn't the only issue. Thus, this are some reasons why you essays might not be doing well. 

&#x200B;

1. Time management - not being able to write full essay and not enough paragraphs
2. Not understanding qn or on the given poem/prose
3. Misreading qn or not answering qn ( Eg: qn ask for both devices and feelings, you only gave feelings)
4. narrating your points instead of elaborating them (its more common than you think)
5. Weak points(first paragraph marks a big impression to the marker, so if your first para is not as strong, marks could be pulled down)
6. Repetition of points - basically you keep repeating what you said
7. Your essay structure is not clear.
8. Over-excessive amount of evidence quotes( max to be at least 2-3 lines)
9. Narration of quotes(basically not giving exact quotes)

This are some pointers to check on your essay writing. Check through your essay and look at what you wrote. Ask yourself whether your points are strong, maybe too much narration and all that. I also thought that my essay was fine, but I realise I tend to repeat my points just that I kept rephrasing it. I'm pretty sure sch markers would give you some points on the side of your essay, so do read those as well. If you're still struggling please go and seek consults with your teacher. I'm pretty sure your teachers will be willing to help. 

&#x200B;

**For studying lit,** 

1. make sure to understand what your book is about. If by now you are still struggling to understand, please take the time to sit down and read the book, especially since you now have notes that you have taken down in the past 2 years to refer to. 
2. Highlight key quotes that can be used for essay writing since this can be helpful for evidence. 
3. At least try to remember 5 impressions and feelings for each character that you can remember evidence( do not have to be in direct quotes but try rmb to rmb exact details to it, but best if use the exact quotes) for text qn. (Try to have a two sides of characters Eg: positive and negative traits, unless qn states)
4. Remember specific scenes that took place and the significance it played to the story and to the characters involved. -moments qn
5.  For prose and poem, know the use of literary devices. When analysing the unseen, do take the time to do annotations. Advise 10 minutes since I recommend the rest of your time to start writing.

# Things to note before entering NAFA

**\[1\] What is NAFA and who is it for?**

NAFA, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts is Singapore's pioneering art school. It is a private arts institution. It provides diploma studies with a study duration of 3 years just like poly. The special thing about NAFA is that it provides 1-year degree programmes which any student (usually from relevant diploma courses) can pick up.

Well, we always say 'art is subjective', it is a freedom of expression. The school is really **open to anyone** (and that is on the account that you have a portfolio or passed the test). Literally, you can have aunties and uncles as your classmates! You also have people doing art because it's fun but in all seriousness do not sign up if that's what you think. I'd like to think of NAFA as a school that guides you in the beginning and later on they just kind of let everyone be independent learners. Anybody can say that NAFA teaches you the foundation but they do not intend to fully teach you long term or up to a professional level. The school is excellent for people who have existing art skills (you've won SYF, art awards, distinction in art before you were even 17 years old) and wish to be a local artist. It is also great for people who are passionate and have some sort of basic skill or are/have developing skills already (that's me!) however this group should avoid Fine Arts. You can also be passionate and start on a blank slate but be prepared to work doubly hard for the grades. The school is **not competitive**, it depends on talent to stand out.

Do not come if you are doing for the sake of the diploma because the **difficulty of NAFA's diploma is no joking matter**. Dropping out is common in every course and you do not wish to contribute to that. That is also the whole point of NAFA charging exorbitant school fees so that you don't run away. Many people actually bet their future on NAFA because they couldn't go to poly/uni course of their choice and it ends up being wasted because it's not what they wanted! You may have heard people of saying that the school's standard is trash but the truth is, it's not the school's problem 100% of the time.

For students looking to enter NAFA Foundation Programme, it's still new and dodgy. I strongly advise you guys to take O levels and head to Poly instead if you still wish to pursue further education at local universities. I personally find no point in skipping a year and getting L1R4>25 with an O level cert where you might've passed math seems to be a more lucrative choice to use for entering NAFA. The only benefit you're getting from the programme is a debt $$$.

*Entry requirements:*

**O Level:** L1R4 equal or less than 25 points excluding English (can use CCA points)

**ITE:** Full-time Higher Nitec or Nitec

[Other Local/International Admission Requirements](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/admission-requirements)

*Important note:*

**NAFA diplomas do not equate with polytechnic diplomas.**

**NAFA being the oldest art school does not mean that it is the best place to go instead of Laselle.**

&#x200B;

**\[2\] Available Courses**

One misconception is that NAFA has double diploma programmes for 3D Design. I'd like to announce that it is **false**. The school is not capable of teaching 2 types of diploma at a time but rather mash it up. So if you intend to take my course for example Diploma in Design (Landscape and Architecture), it is usually the 1st word that is mainly taught which is 'Landscape'.

**\[3\] When and how to apply?**

Once you received your results is usually the time applications are open. Local and international students have until March to apply. It varies annually. More here ->[How to apply](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/how-to-apply)

Method of Application: **Online portfolio submission or physical admission test**

Neither is better than the other. You method depends on whether you can show what you have within a given deadline.

&#x200B;

*Online Portfolio Submission*

Minimum 10 images, various mediums allowed and a short writeup of 100 words.

**1.Make the portfolio for the course that you want**

To make them pick you directly for the course, make it look like you are built for the course.

**2. Have a variety of work**

Fine Arts doesn't only consist of drawings, it can also include some sort of sculpture or performance work. Same goes for the other departments. [Click here for what each course requires.](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information/how-to-apply) If you wish to showcase a single type of work because you are unable to show more, it can make your portfolio look okay/bad compared to other people.

**3. A passionate statement**

Only 100 words. Tbh I wrote what I wished to do after my diploma (plans have since changed and it was an odd statement lol). I don't suggest writing about your contribution to the sch because as long as you're a student you're contributing. Make it short and simple.

&#x200B;

In case anyone is wondering, my application portfolio was mediocre, showing 11 images consisting of sketches/paintings/photos. If you have a god-tier portfolio because you have that artistic talent, there's a good chance to achieve a 1st-year full-coverage scholarship once you step into NAFA. You can submit whenever you want but my estimated deadline was 2 weeks after applying at the open house which waived my application fees ($70 better treat yourself Haidilao).

&#x200B;

*Admission Test* (if someone has taken the test feel free to provide more info)

The test dates are staggered once per month from January-March. Held in groups. Consists of a drawing test and write-up.

I only know that the drawing test isn't difficult. People who took the test do not intend to submit a portfolio as it's quick and efficient. Nothing much to add on.

*Important note:*

If you are writing a **2nd choice** as a safety net please be cautious. I do not recommend as you may get the 2nd choice instead if the slots for your 1st choice becomes full. They will just shift you to the 2nd choice and that's where the 'appeal' part comes.

Choose to submit a portfolio if you can commit to the deadline, it usually gives you an upper hand over admission test applicants because you're showcasing more.

&#x200B;

**\[4\] Application Timeline** (I only know O levels if anyone can kindly tell me I'll update)

*O levels:*

**January**

Receive results > submit JAE >  apply for NAFA

**February**

Wait for JAE AND NAFA results > receive JAE results 1st > receive NAFA results 2nd

You’ll receive NAFA results before poly starts unless you apply late. I applied during Jan on the day of the open house and got my results mid-end Feb. March is the last month to receive results.

&#x200B;

**\[5\] Financial Aid**

[NAFA Financial Aid](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/scholarships-financial-aid-schemes)

Now, we all know private school isn't cheap and many passionate young souls I've met depend heavily on financial aid like I do. If you're a Singaporean with a tight family income, the bursary is attainable for you. It covers half of the annual school fee. Can only be taken once for each year of study. If you are able to claim the bursary for all your years, you’d pay a total of $7050.

For those who are hoping to start at NAFA but is at a really tight end, you need perfect grades in art and portfolio to be considered a scholarship/merit in your first year. You'll need testimonials and pass the interview. If you ain’t good in art, pass this opportunity however you can work for scholarship/merit during your diploma years. I’d score close to the 4.0 (3.8X) in Year 1 in order to get a scholarship to cover my Year 2 fees.

Other options are the 0% interest study loan by DBS. You can make use of your PSEA which you can also use your sibling account to cover your own sch fees.

Last option but not really one is the student assistantship scheme should you already be a student of NAFA. The pay is peanuts, I would not recommend but it's nice to have a one-liner in your resume that you did some work for the school :).

There are NAFA students with a possibly far worse situation than yours but they are extremely talented and hardworking to end up not paying a single cent. NAFA is really expensive so if you do intend to work to cover the fees, take care of your grades as well. It is not impossible to do so. I chose to not work as I was in a hectic design course and needed to maintain my grade for university.

&#x200B;

Next, you would need to understand how the system works.

# During your study

**\[1\] Useful Acronyms**

*SOAD:* School of Art and Design (Department)

*SOAMDT*: School of Arts Management, Dance and Theatre

*SOM:* School of Music

*D&M:* Design and Media

*FA:* Fine Arts

*3DD:* 3D Design

*FS:* Fashion Studies

*FYP:* Final Year Project (used in almost every SOAD course lol)

*OIP:* Overseas Immersion Programme

&#x200B;

**\[2\] Life at NAFA**

So you wish to know how life is like at NAFA? First thing, don't expect the same amount of glitz and glamour that exists in polys. It's much quieter where you won't even hear a mouse die.

Because entry to the school is quite easy, the population regularly consists of graduated ITE students (can’t make it to poly/NAFA is the last golden ticket) alongside many international students. O level cert holders are like a small 10% or less. So if you’re young, prepare to take care of the older lot and expect to carry lazy people.

You have to be very committed to the course and can’t skip class. More than 3 times and they start deducting marks. The workload is heavy and even if it comes in small numbers, it is intense. The number of student to lecturer ratio is not a big difference but later on, consultation times may not suffice. Facilities are sufficient unless you’re in a design course. There are CCAs in the sch but not all courses got time for it. Staying in school late is a common culture. Fine Arts students after class just camp in their respective studios and design students would camp till closing 11 pm at the computer lab waiting for renders to finish. Every student will experience staying late and you can say its #lifeatnafa.

The culture here is not as toxic and dramatic as poly but more towards weird because we’re creative artsy-fartsy people. It’s easy to get along with course mates but there’s a chance for things to get somehow cranky along the way. Could be you or your classmate. Everyone is pretty open and wild. There’s a lack of competitiveness which is both good and bad.

There won't be a course that goes without presentations. That's the point of producing works ain't it, to show it off to the audience. Group work to individual work ratio is about 3:6 so if you worry about bad groupmates, don't worry I've faced them too and it can't be helped ;). Carrying other people during group work is also common. NAFA does stand for lazy people what to do. Your complaints hold no power. (Arguably, many students want the school to make entry to the courses more difficult as there seem to be too many bums to handle)

If you're mentally depressed or anything the school does try to help but no legit support system other than the ECG counsellor (which I find it practically useless). Now, the school deals with this quite often so they don't give a damn about your life. Ownself take care ownself is the usual term.

&#x200B;

*School events anyone can participate:*

Open House (1-day Sentosa fun time with other Open House ambassador)

Orientation (has a 1-night camp! Recommend)

NAFA Fun Day

Overseas Immersion Programme (1-3 weeks long, Asian countries. Recommend but need $)

Student Assistantship Programme (1 year-long contract. Peanut pay)

&#x200B;

The list of programmes here may not seem much but you can add it in your portfolio (except Fun Day).  There may be volunteer work available within some courses itself. Do try to be active

And that's about it. Nothing special just expensive and less fun.

&#x200B;

**\[3\] Understanding NAFA's SOAD Standard**

Take a look at what past graduates have produced within their 3 years as a student. Only you can judge whether the school is great or the right fit for your goals (in being able to attain this particular level of skill for XXX course once you graduate for example). The best standard can be found under the best graduate tab.

[2020 The Grad Expectations](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/thegradexpectations)

[Graduation Showcase](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/showcase/graduation-showcase?itemscount=8&year=2020&graduate=featured)

&#x200B;

**\[4\] General Curriculum**

[Academic Calendar](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/academic-information)

The 1st semester of your study begins at the start of August and usually ends late November or early December depending on the type of assessment received. The 2nd semester begins in January till May. The span of 1 semester is always around 4 months with a 1-week break in between. We don't really have any sort of term 1/2 thing like poly and is much compressed, so breaks are less. However, you do get compensated with a 3-month vacation between years so that's fair.

&#x200B;

\*Applicable to SOAD only

*Year 1*

&#x200B;

It’s clearly not much different from poly, slightly worse at certain points. **Weekly** **school hours per week will increase each semester** e.g year 1 sem 1 is 18hrs a week for classes, next semester you may get an additional 2-4 hrs increase of class time. The longest time I had for class each week was 24hrs, pretty sure the same goes for any SOAD course. Do expect late-night classes. It is inevitable because most lecturers are teaching part-time so do bear with them.

Important note:

For a lighter schedule, **do electives early** as that's one of the simplest things to do.

The difference in timetable won't affect application to university.

&#x200B;

**\[5\] Electives**

1 common mistake students commit is not reading the student handbook (from studentnet)/contract on the number of credits required for graduation. They end up finishing their electives during Year 3 Semester 2 which is the time one should focus on their FYP. Start doing your electives once you’re in Year 1 Semester 2. Good planning consists of not stuffing your modules until it’s way past 24hrs/week (also known as overloading). You’re required to do cross-disciplinary modules 2-6 credits worth (meaning not related to your course, if you’re from D&M you have to do either FA/3DD/FS) and course-related electives worth 2-6 credits. Days before module registration, plan out the electives you want to do based on your given timetable and then rush to pick on the day of the module registration with no hesitation to secure your placement. You may have to do an elective that is unfamiliar to you.

*My sample plan:*

**Year 1 sem 1:** Can’t choose yet

**Year 1 sem 2**: Photography (Highly recommend, popular as well but must have time and skill + a friend who's free who be your model). 2 credits

**Year 1 sem 2 special term (aka holiday):** OIP to Hangzhou. China Academy of Arts for 3 weeks. Considered cross-disciplinary to FA. 3 weeks long. 4 credits

**Year 2 sem 1:** Intro to Rapid prototyping from 3DD (laser cut/3D print) (didn’t really learn how to use the machine as there are technical officers and I messed up at the end but still passed, great elective for embarrassing yourself if you’re a 3DD student who frequents the workshop ;) ). 2 credits

**Year 2 sem 2 - onwards:** No more electives can focus on FYP

*Important note:*

Plan well so you accumulate just nice **120 credits for graduation**. No point in exceeding the total credits as you have to pay extra for it. If you miss a few credits for graduation, you will be **retained** for another semester to finish.

**Cheat tip:** if you go on the OIP to China only, you instantly get cross-disciplinary credits.

&#x200B;

**\[6\] Using Workshops/Loaning of equipment**

* The 3D workshop at wing B level 1 operates Mon-Fri 8 am to 6 pm but you need permission from the lecturer or Technical officer to use the machinery.
* Laser cutting and 3D printing in the 3D workshop operates from Mon-Fri 10:30-4:30 pm and it is based on a **first sign up first serve basis**. Booking is always done a week prior to the day of actual usage and maximum of 4 people per day (unless you let others share your slot). Every Friday the slate inside the workshop outside the room is wiped clean for students to book for the week ahead. Even if your name is on the booking board and you don't end up cutting, you will get a temporal ban after multiple attempts. Do ask the Technical officer about the laser cutting template as well and follow accordingly when you create the template so as to not cause a problem of cleaning up your drawing which may overtake another timeslot.
* Camera equipment for photography/filming can be loaned from a guy named 'Jack'. Priority goes to courses that require it, followed by the photography elective and so on. Loan lasts for a week and extension can be asked for after loan period.
* Photography Studio/Darkroom use needs to have a form signed, given to 'Jack' and then approved. Literally, find this guy for all your photography needs.
* Fine Art workshop time depends on the course instructor. People from other courses are free to walk in when its empty but usage not possible.

&#x200B;

**\[7\] Internships**

Usually done in Year 3 Semester 1, this is one of the key semesters every student should complete for it plays a very important role in your portfolio for finding a job post-graduation. The school has a reputable network, however for courses like Fine Art and illustration the intern positions may be limited because Singapore is not very welcoming for such talents. There are top companies who are willing to hire NAFA students on the basis that they have good grades and a juicy portfolio. So if you want the best, you got to be the best.

&#x200B;

**\[8\] Overseas Immersion/School Exchange Programmes**

Slots for OIP is limited (especially the ones to China), requires an interview. I think the max for some trips were 35-40 people at most. There are subsidies available and coverage varies.

&#x200B;

*Places NAFA has flown to:*

\*Xiamen (3 weeks)

\*Hangzhou, China Academy of Arts (3 weeks)

\*Beijing, Beijing Technology University (3 weeks)

Bangkok (1 week?)

Korea (might've stopped)

Japan (might've stopped)

&#x200B;

\*Special programme during Year 1 Semester 2 vacation only

I forgot the cost but I've personally have flown to Hangzhou. Best experience ever despite getting a C. Crazy stuff happened at one of the finest Arts school in China :)

*Important note:*

If you miss the chance to fly, fret not, NAFA's degree programme is a collaboration with a foreign university and they will open an exchange programme for 1 month (that is if COVID doesn't persist). Not sure about the cost though.

&#x200B;

**\[9\] CCA** (The price list is not updated as of 2020)

*List of currently available CCAs:*

1. Muay Thai ( $63 10 sessions)
2. Yoga (basic: $50 12 sessions, intermediate: $42 10 sessions)
3. Entrepreneurship club
4. Urban runners club
5. Volunteer club

Short story: Long ago, I actually joined the photography club only to end up leaving before they even started anything because everybody was too busy to meet up and thus disbanded.

During my time, Muay Thai is the most popular followed by Yoga. Do check out [NAFA OSC](https://www.instagram.com/nafa_osc/) account on IG to find out what they do. Looks like they added Korean language class too hmm

&#x200B;

# Post-Diploma

**\[1\] Furthering Studies at NAFA**

[NAFA Degree courses for Arts Management and Music](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/courses/degree)

**Update (thanks to the comment below):** NAFA is going to change its programmes and collaboration starting from AY2021/2022. The new degree courses are collaborating with UAL (University of Arts, London) and it’s changing from one year course to two-year course which includes 5-7 weeks of going to the colleges in London. **All the courses are affected** except for Arts Management and Music.

Students with A Level certificates, as well as those without relevant diplomas will be allowed to enrol into NAFA’s degree programmes.

**The stuff I wrote may not apply anymore but I will still leave it here as a reference for NAFA's 1-year degree. The degree website is empty for now.**

&#x200B;

How do you determine if taking NAFA degree is worth it and why should you take or not take the NAFA degree? There’s always a mixed bag of opinions over the degree. Personally, I’m not a fan of it but I won’t be biased and input the pros and cons that can better aid in one’s decision.

&#x200B;

*PROS*

**1.Existing CGPA from diploma is Low**

Finding a job with the private diploma cert and low grades can affect your career progression. Make up for the mistakes that were done during the diploma study and try to do well for the degree.

**2. High CGPA, expecting a scholarship (or free ride) for the degree course**

If you easily meet these 3 criteria (1) Singapore's local unis are too expensive for your taste, (2) you might be older than 21 years old and need to work ASAP, (3) ""broke"" but did quite well during your diploma and has an excellent portfolio to show, taking the degree might not be such a bad option. In some instances, the 1-year degree + years of work experience can allow one to take up a master degree at local uni if the pre-requisites are met.

**3. Changing career path (still art-related)**

It's possible to change paths from design to fine arts. However, for a degree that lasts only for 1 year, it is impossible to acquire a decent knowledge at a degree level compared to the diploma stage in my opinion. Usually, the people who apply for the design degree e.g Spatial Design, have prior knowledge from the related course of study either from NAFA or other polys. 1 year is not enough but never said that it’s impossible and has been done over the years.

**4. Increase in starting salary**

Nobody says this when asked why they want to take the degree but I'm sure they want an increase in starting salary. If you have a fear of starting out with low pay and want to bump it up by sacrificing a short amount of time and money, go for it.

&#x200B;

*CONS*

**1.Not a legit degree**

This isn’t a biased answer but an honest one. NAFA's degree is not a professional degree. 1-year won't be enough to acquire a lot of knowledge. There are no internships and full training of Softwares/techniques whatsoever. It's basically aimed at NAFA/poly students who have an existing skillset and internship experience during their diploma studies or international students with similar qualifications. I'm not discouraging anyone who wishes to take the degree because some companies do take in students and if they're lucky, they can work for them after graduation.

**2. Not 100% applicable for postgraduate studies in Singapore**

The local universities may not kindly cater to all NAFA degrees. A number of students after getting a NAFA degree would choose to study overseas to pursue a masters. If getting NAFA's degree is a mean of broadening your studying experience by going overseas, why not? One real-life example that I've heard of works is landscape and architecture diploma + Spatial Design degree + 3 years of work experience at a good company + an excellent portfolio which eventually led this person to enter NUS Masters in Landscape Architecture. Spatial Design has a chance for relevant postgraduate courses although this may not be the same for the other NAFA degrees.

**3. Not worth if you are a Singaporean**

The cost of NAFA's degree is considered affordable for an international student and it was practically built for them. If a Singaporean were to study at local uni for 3/4 years including subsidies + tuition grant for a design degree, it'd still be cheaper than a NAFA degree. Plus an actual degree from the public unis is still considered much valuable.

&#x200B;

If you stand for better higher educational standards after staying there for 3 years, I say work hard and flee.

&#x200B;

**\[2\] Furthering studies at a local university**

It’s not impossible. It was already allowed a million years ago. It just a matter of effort you put during your diploma years. The current standard at NAFA has dwindled where only less than 10 NAFA grads emerge victoriously so don't be surprised knowing that NAFA barely has high flyers, the school doesn't even push for it. Even my juniors don't know my degree existed 1 year ago...

*2 things to note:*

1. NAFA diploma is not allowed entry into many courses that are irrelevant from the diploma unless the GPA is high. The usual entry requirements are GPA 3.5-4.0 also dependent on the 10th percentile, juicy portfolio and testimonial (I didn't need it FYI)
2. Chances are higher for relevant degrees although any degree will definitely have entry requirements to meet. Some degrees require O level pass in elementary/additional math (they say they don't check anymore after 2019 but I don't want to play out my chances). I know of students who were optimistic about their GPA but they did not read the instructions beforehand.

You will be fighting with the best from poly, JC and beyond. Do your best to represent yourself as a student from NAFA and you'll find a way to stand out from the crowd.

***A warning note to future/existing international NAFA students:*** I know most of y’all only started living in Singapore just before the beginning of the diploma. I don’t know whether your international qualifications can equate with O levels so **consider your future plans in Singapore carefully**. My dear international classmates weren’t called up for uni interview (GPA already wasn’t helping, no offence) and the super stringent admission criteria crippled their hopes. Many have remained in NAFA to do the 1-year degree or have returned to their home country. I cannot answer for employment rates. If neither one is the option you want to end up with, do take note.

&#x200B;

**\[3\] Finding Work**

COVID really struck a lot of people hard. I can count the number of my coursemate who is employed with my 10 fingers or less. The full-time employment rate is terrible, believe it or not. The school hides it like the fine print in the student contract. Here in the [Graduate Employment Survey](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/why-nafa/graduate-employment-survey), you can see the ending choices of NAFA graduates.

I really can't tell the success rate of one finding a job even based on IG stories itself. I see quite a number of freelancer or people doing other things. Who will remain in the same industry? The top 10% in the cohort but even the best have struggled or are still struggling to find a job. NAFA students are not only fighting among themselves, there are poly students with similarly named courses out there too with a proper educational lineup that a NAFA diploma can't compare with.

A portfolio is usually the passport for finding work and the past 3 years of study is meant to fill it up. Don't waste time being a stubborn student especially when you will be spending a lot of money to study. The best way to make yourself look hire-able is to definitely have good grades and a portfolio. Can't emphasise anything else other than that to convince the company to hire you.

&#x200B;

# Wrapping it up

NAFA is one of the schools that provides a unique and alternative route away from the usual poly lifestyle. I had some crazy times in there be it social life or workload. It isn't a bad school (I quote 5/10) but if you can work for what you love, you'll do just fine.

The Open House is open and I suggest for those interested to take a look. A whole bunch of admission guides are up for talks.

837,"[SAT] Poly dropped out, need advice","Edit: I just realised I need at least 12 years of study for a local uni, so SAT is out. 
My options left are :
1. Private A level>Uni, get degree in 5 years but gonna study like mad
2. Private diploma>private degree get degree sooner but not as competitive as a local uni degree.
3. Redo poly>local uni. 7 years total, very long path. Getting in uni with Diploma is hard too.


My current situation: I dropped out of Poly, now serving the nation. Going to ORD in few months. My highest qualification is O'level 

I dropped out of Poly because I was too playful and didn't give a shit about my results during my poly life. After serving the nation for 1 year+ , all my platoonmates are going to uni, I starts to worried about my future.... 

I came across this exam called SAT, which the local unis accept for admission. I don't know if I can apply to a local uni with just SAT results since I didn't graduate from poly.
If I can't, is there any other way I can get into a uni fast? Cuz I'm quite old alr and I don't want to waste any more time... 

I super regret right now for not studying hard enough during my poly days. 

I'm willing to study hard for my SAT or any other exams. 

The route I want to take (if possible) is NS>SAT>UNI 

My main concern is whether I can get into a local uni with SAT results, without a diploma/A'level. 

Any advice??",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kfo8v7/sat_poly_dropped_out_need_advice/,True,2020-12-19 08:25:05

839,[JC] Proportion of different races in different schools," Hi, I'm a student from ACSI. I've been noticing that my school consists of mostly chinese and Indian students, with the occasional foreigner. Given that the Malays constitute a sizeable proportion of singapore's ethnicity(more so than indians) , I'm curious as to why they are such a minority in my school(only 1-2 local malays in my cohort). Are there other tertiary institutions(More interested about JCs, since i study in one, and is the flair and tag for this post, but will also consider answers about other tertiary institutions) with disproportionally more malays? If so, what could be the possible reason(s)? By extension, what are the racial proportions in other institutions?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iwczwb/jc_proportion_of_different_races_in_different/,True,2020-09-21 04:30:08

841,[O Levels] my o level chinese story last year,"after seeing countless of threads of people asking whether they should retake mt, let me share my experience. i took o level chinese last year and my chinese is actually shit, like c5-b4 range. but for o levels i have gotten a c6. like wtf c6? i just died at that moment and wanted to kms... like ik i wrote some fuck shit 操你妈 phrases in my paper but i didnt expect a c6. when i came home i was literally emotional af. everyone i know was getting b3/a2 thinking whether they should retake and im here like... i got twice your score like wtf dude give me a break...

but in the end, after much consideration, i decided to retake chinese even though i knew that it will never be in my l1r5 because i want my o level cert to not have a fking c6 cause thats ugly af. (and yes your chinese and your other subjects are in one whole cert when you receive your o level results in january). 

during chi lesson, people are literally having a break and doing work for other subj and here we are in this corner writing another compo/email and it was literally the most sien moment cause everyone could do literally what they want.

i actually didnt study for chinese at all during my revision for o levels because im there just to erase that c6 off the cert, not to put in my l1r5. so before the retake paper i was scrolling through some chinese tiktok in hopes of bringing some improvement this time round. and it fking worked. i actually gotten a B and was quite happy.

well so thats my story. i wrote this just to make sure that people who didnt do so well (like me getting a c) cheer up and move on because you should never let this obstacle pull your other subjects down when you take the actual and more important o level in october/november. peace",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ifl4ql/o_levels_my_o_level_chinese_story_last_year/,True,2020-08-25 00:26:17
842,[A levels] H2 Economics time management - how much time to spend on writing each question?,"Hello there! I was always struggling with economics throughout my 2 years of JC, always failing and getting U grade. One thing that I always struggle with is time management for Econs paper. Hence, I'm sharing a tip on time management for exam, specifically targeted on the **Amount of Time to spend on each question in CSQ/ESSAY.**

**CSQ (1h 7 min for each question):**

\-7 minutes to read and unpack CSQ 

\-24 mins for short answer question 

\-16 mins for 8m question

\-20 mins for 10m question

Write down the time that you MUST **start** attempting the 8m/10m questions and CSQ 2 by the side of the questions. For example, if exam is 8am - 10:15am, 

1. CSQ 1: 8m ques (8:30am)
2. CSQ 1: 10m ques (8:46am)
3. Start CSQ 2 by 9:05 - 9:07am
4. CSQ 2: 8m ques (9:35am)
5. CSQ 2: 10m ques (9:50am)

**Essay**

45 mins for each question: 

* 5 mins to plan for both part a and b
* 15 mins for part (a) 
* 25 mins for part (b) (leave at least 8 min to write on evaluation, which stands 5m!!) 

The thing about having this format is that you **MUST** conclude and move on to the next part/qns when you see that the time is up. If you keep delaying and think that you can eat up 1 minute of the time for the next question, do that for every question and there will be no time left for the last question. It did not work for me at the start because i kept delaying on starting the next ques, but after learning how to really stop and move on, I managed to complete my papers for the first time. 

Also, I know that for time management, other than knowing how much time you should spend on answering each ques, you should **first** know your content well + answering techniques + practice. But always remember that time management for each question is very important as you do not want the scenario in which you do not have the time to write even when you know the answer. 

PS: You do not have to strictly follow the time allocation given here. The time allocation is a general guideline, and on the assumption that you have all the necessary content + techniques + practices already. If you feel that you like to have more time for some parts (like essay in CSQ), do give yourself more time there. However, the main thing is that you should pre-plan how much time you want to allocate so that you are mentally prepared to move on when needed :)

I will continue to post some Econs TIPs here and there that helped me get my A grade eventually in A Levels! Hope that it will be of help to you :) JIAYOUS to everyone studying right now, you are not alone and I'm sure your hard work will pay off as long as you do not give up :')",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hwe78o/a_levels_h2_economics_time_management_how_much/,True,2020-07-24 03:44:49
843,[UNI] NUS FASS: Take note that there are DIFFERENCES between China and Chinese Studies!!,"I made this post to highlight that there are **clear differences** between Chinese and China Studies, at least in the context of NUS FASS.

A lot of people seem to confuse between the two and it is appalling that even FASS students themselves refer to Chinese Studies as China Studies when they have taken the Chinese Studies exposure module, CH1101E, themselves after I saw this post on r/NUS: [https://amp.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/gn8o1z/recommendations\_for\_fass\_exposure\_mods/](https://amp.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/gn8o1z/recommendations_for_fass_exposure_mods/)

I just wanted to clarify it for incoming freshmen (those who accepted NUS FASS offers already) as well as current undergraduates who may not know the differences.

**In short, the terms of Chinese Studies and China Studies are different and should NOT be used interchangeably and one term cannot substitute or be exchanged for another.**

I think it is understandable why people would confuse between Chinese Studies and China Studies as many associate and assume China=Chinese and Chinese= China. This is a view commonly held by the western world who often lack the understanding and knowledge of Asians, Chinese and China and the context of China. In fact, an European website even claimed China Studies = Chinese Studies and Sinology.  


I will explain why by showing the main differences between these two fields of study.

Here are some of the main differences:

&#x200B;

* **Firstly, the scope of what they study is different.**

China Studies is studying about China, the country: in a multidisciplinary way where one studies its economy, society, foreign relations, and politics.

Chinese Studies is different: it covers Chinese literature, philosophy, art, business, media as well as history. It is also known as Sinology.

*Of course, they will have overlaps especially in the Chinese history part, but as a whole, they are separate.*

&#x200B;

* **Additionally, you can major AND minor in Chinese Studies but you cannot major in China Studies.**

You can ONLY minor in China Studies! China studies is ALSO a MULTIDISCIPLINARY minor!

&#x200B;

* **Furthermore, most modules in Chinese Studies are in Chinese, although some are in English. Chinese is the medium of instruction for Chinese Studies. On the other hand, China Studies modules are mostly in English.**

To add on further, Chinese Studies modules often have a component of Overseas Chinese where they study the history of Chinese in the Southeast Asian community. Overseas Chinese are those who do not live in China and are like Malaysian Chinese or even Singaporean Chinese, for example. The study of Chinese history in Chinese Studies does not take place only in China but also overseas such as Indonesia and Singapore as well. 
China Studies, on the other hand, focuses on the country of China and solely China including its special administrative regions (SARs) such as Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan and their interactions with China. But ultimately, China Studies tend to cover China more than its special administrative regions. 

&#x200B;

* **Lastly, as a multidisciplinary minor, the modules in China Studies are from different fields of study within FASS, including History, Political Science, and Sociology UNLIKE that of Chinese Studies, which the modules coded CH, all come from the same department: Chinese Studies.**

China Studies does not have its own department or modules belonging to China Studies department (you take modules that already exist and were created by other departments such as Political Science, Economics, or History) and the minor was created by FASS Office of Programmes. Some but not all Chinese Studies modules are also counted as part of China Studies minor.

Bearing all these differences in mind, it must be reiterated, however, that the two fields of study have common similarities since there is Chinese in China and China when we mention Chinese and after all, the Chinese language was created by China.

Nonetheless, they have significant differences in the scope of study and medium of instruction, especially in the context of undergraduate studies at FASS, NUS Singapore.

**To sum it all up, the terms ""Chinese Studies"" and ""China Studies"" CANNOT and should NOT be used interchangeably. And one cannot substitute the other if you are referring to it within the context of NUS FASS.**

Thank you and I hope this clarifies and prevents any future confusion for all!! :)

844,[A Levels] freaking out over receiving results,"ive had so many dreams about A's. doing alright, doing badly, realising i havent finished A's (which isnt true) and i should be studying instead of playing and even studying after A's have finished... all sorts of weird things. whatever it is, its driving me crazy and i have so high hopes for myself which doesnt help either.

also ive no idea what my plans are after receiving my results. like if i can go to uni, what course? or should i go overseas? but im broke. or should i try to get a scholarship to go somewhere? but whos going to offer me a scholarship? what if i dont do well enough to earn one? idk omg im really freaking out.

my jc life has been so tumultuous and my physical and mental health has deteriorated bc of it. i really wanna collect my results in private after everyone has collected theirs and gone home. i really think listening to the principal talking before handing out the results and seeing everyone do well is just gonna cause my anxiety to rocket like crazy again. im not ready for this!! ><",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f23cjp/a_levels_freaking_out_over_receiving_results/,True,2020-02-11 20:50:28

847,[O Levels] anyone who is in need of a motivational read!,"hey there! im just gna post this here as a part of an encouragement to not only to you, and to myself :))

so let me start off from this. i have been reading so many ppl panicking about how they cant do this anymore, they feel burnt out, they think they are utterly screwed after prac and oral ect. i just wna let you guys know that to 

1)make sure to always remind yourself about all the little successes you gained over your stretch to olevels, be it passing first time on a mini test, being top in a kahoot game, getting your first B or a A, or passing for the first time. All of these mini successes prove you wrong, that you are not entirely hopeless/helpess. If u managed to reach your goal, your first success at that time, why cant you do it again? Theres nothing stopping you from reaching that success if you make sure that there isnt anything obstructing you from it.

2) so lets say you worked really hard but you still cant do it, it might be an important subject, it might not. lets say this subject is science, and you only take one science subject and it must be counted in your l1r5, but you still do it badly. tell yourself that at least you knew that you have given your best, even though that is the grade you achieved. even if you dont achieve what you wanted for science, so what? Its not the end! Theres so many other options out there that doesn’t require science. Not doing well for a subject is not a failure. Your grades only determine your path to a certain extent. Everything else is about what you can do about it and what you control.To me, its only failure if you cant do that. So believe in yourself, these grades is not the end of your journey 

3) + adding on, theres so many failure to success stories out there, even the ppl with the biggest success have failed more than us, and sunk to the bottom, but yet they succeeded. so why not adding your success story to the collection of those stories and be an inspiration to someone else?:)

jiayos, if you are being consistent, keep up the good work! if you think you are failing, dont give up, u can do this.

all the best!🤩🤪",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j810ey/o_levels_anyone_who_is_in_need_of_a_motivational/,True,2020-10-10 07:26:59

849,"[Rant] We, as human beings, are incredibly overworked from school-induced pressure","Not trying to farm karma or sit on the moral high horse, but just wanted to express a sentiment that is deeply rooted in my beliefs after slaving through it for about \~12 years. 

I come from a *relatively* casual family who happens to be in the high socio-economic standing. My parents allowed me to pursue whatever major I want as long as I work hard for it and that it can provide a stable living. 

They aren't super particular about the quality of my grades (GPA above 3 is tolerated, as long as I can enter a uni course after, which is around 3.3X for NTU philosophy ) 

But even then, I still feel the incredible pressure from doing my absolute best in my schoolwork. I feel cornered into a situation where I take what it takes to get my best GPA. 

Sometimes, I feel like I'm learning not because I want to learn, but because I can highlight the relevant information for the upcoming test/ assignments. 

Thankfully, I'm a humanities student who loves what almost whatever he's studying. But imagine about the large proportion of young children coerced into taking subjects or courses by their parents, even though they strongly dislike it or inept at it. 

How many of those RI, Hwa Chong, Anglo-Chinese students are happy? How many of them actually enjoy studying what they study? How many of these poor souls are gaining true life experience or exploring themselves to mature as individuals? How many of them look to death to escape their torment?

Our academic culture isn't like Japan where we attend school for the sake of it and just pass it. Many students in our education system are made to study over-complex subjects under the burden of reaching an expectation of academic excellence (80+/100) due to pressure from parents and school? 

I've seen it and experience it firsthand what is it like to slave under these horrendous conditions. O levels were my absolute breaking point. I went through so many mental breakdowns just so I can cram the information into my head and regurgitate the swallowed info into the exam paper. 

I've seen too many people going bonkers from the academic stress exerted on them, with some even looking to self-harm as an unhealthy output to release their stress. It's simply inhumane. Period.

Parents, the main culprit, fail to spare a single thought for the emotional state for their suffering child, send their children through excessive tuition and supplementary lessons on top of nearly impossible standards set for them. All these children will understand in their life is stress, overwork and misery.

What I abhor most are answering techniques and the approach mainstream schoolteachers adopt during lessons. They are there not to cultivate a love for learning or make the subject fascinating for students to learn and grow as people. They are only there to teach you the *correct* manner to answer. 

What happened to learning because the subject was interesting and insightful? What happened to true learning? 

As a future social entrepreneur and secular humanist, I dream of a future when we can reform our education system that implements an effective curriculum that enables students to study in safe and nurturing environments without overexerting them. An academic culture that fosters intrapersonal exploration and true learning that shapes our youths positively. 

This is probably poorly worded but feel free to message me, I'd love to talk more about this topic that I'm quite passionate about.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hiuehy/rant_we_as_human_beings_are_incredibly_overworked/,True,2020-07-01 11:32:10
850,[A Levels] rant (and seeking advice on) demotivation + studies,"kinda a rant and seeking for some advice as well 

tldr; used to be getting straight As in secondary school, came to a mid-high tier jc, (am j2 now) doing not so well despite working hard and setting lower expectations, what to do (in terms of revising/managing emotions/life?) 

the longer story: 
well, i’ve always been doing well throughout secondary school and attained that straight As in Os and entered a mid-high tier jc and took pcme (all h2s) 

jc’s been tough, but not really as well, i can manage my tutorials, lectures pretty decently, myes for j1 was pretty okay at BBBB/E (though admittedly i was hella disappointed since i carried my straight As expectations into jc), promos was terrible at CECE/B but i figured out it was a wrong studying method i was using (i focused too much on 1 subject and neglected the rest, thinking that my foundation for earlier topics can carry me through) 

j2 came and i was determined to buck up as well as lower down my expectations to avoid big disappointments. i reviewed my lecture notes, reviewed the tutorials, completed the extra worksheets provided, and on top of that, completed the past year school papers sooooo i improved a bit at CBCB/D and though i admittedly again, felt disappointed, i also felt kinda relieved that hey i improved a bit

and right now with myes and all, though i never received any results back, i can tell that i screwed up (yknow that gut feeling where you know you just gon do badly for a test, ya)

the formatting of the post might get a little messy from here because there’s so much to say yet i’m not sure how to phrase them, but basically i just feel defeated? like for example i put in the most effort for gp, doing essay outlines, practising AQ but alas, i know i’m not going to do well in gp (and i’ve always been struggling with english since young) i’ve always been self-driven, and use setbacks as sources of motivation to keep myself going, but a setback that last since the start of j1....seems to backfire on my motivation levels, i’m getting tired of studying, and revising, and doing practices, putting in effort, just to receive mediocre results, and to make things worse, my classmates are achieving that straight As/Bs since j1 and i know comparing myself is bad but it’s kinda hard not to at times too? 

some final questions/thoughts? 
1. if i’m looking to attain that 90rp in As, is my goal too far-fetched with the results i’m getting right now
2. what do i do to break out of this “demotivated” state 
3. is there something wrong with my studying methods (or what method should i keep/what other methods to try)

852,[O levels] A recount of significant events that happened during O's (2020),"Just wanted to make this recount so that my fellow batch mates can look back at this someday and feel some sort of nostalgia :')

19 October 2020 - the first o level paper, E Math paper 1. The paper was very manageable, many people commented how easy the paper was in the E Math megathread, and I could sense the general sense of happiness within the cohort. A good start! This was also the beginning of all the sexual innuendos that would surface (remember A, R, S, E?)

20 October 2020 - English paper 1 and 2. Paper 1 was generally manageable, and paper 2 introduced the infamous ""jackass penguins"" to the class of 2020. Many jokes were made, some were concerned about the difficulty of the summary.


After this was E math paper 2 and English LC. There weren't many significant events to my knowledge after these papers, but I do remember the immense speed of the last speaker for English LC lol.


23 and 26 October 2020 - A Math paper 1 and 2. The two most difficult papers of 2020's O levels. Paper 1 went by fine for me, but I could still sense the higher level of difficulty of paper 1 compared to past years. Paper 2 then hit us all like a meteor. Paper 1 was a little difficult, so I thought paper 2 would be easy. Nope. I was wrong. I'm a student who usually does well for A Math, getting consistent A1s, but during the paper I just couldn't answer some of the big questions... Tried my best though, left about 4 marks blank and gave some answers that I knew were incorrect. The A Math paper 2 megathread was filled with people talking about the extent to which they had suffered and I could totally relate to all of them. I still remember someone commenting ""someone shouted fucks sake during the exam"" 


28 October 2020 - elective history paper. Many students expected the Korean War topic to come out, yet it didn't. I did study the correct chapters, but still managed to mess up the essay question somehow. The megathread for this subject was filled with worried students because they spotted the wrong topics.


11 November 2020 - chemistry paper 1, the final paper of the 2020 O levels. Due to the common last topic being cancelled, the paper was only out of 31 (should be 40). My stress level rose as I knew that each mark them carried a higher weightage. Did my best, and pushed through the final hour of O levels. Eventually, the paper ended and O LEVELS WAS FINALLY OVER


To those who collected their results yesterday, good job for pushing through and sitting for a NATIONAL EXAMINATION in 2020, an extraordinarily terrible year. Those who did well, congrats!! You deserve to celebrate. To those who didn't meet their expectations, just remember that there will always be another chance for you to succeed in life. Take this as motivation to do well in whatever other challenge you face in life.

856,[Rant] is it just me,"throwaway account. literally have no words to accurately describe how im feeling now and how i've been feeling for the past few years. for context i am a j1 who was from ip and am now in an elite jc.

i just want to quit leh. i feel like i'm on a hamster wheel and i constantly have to keep running and running and there's no escape, no way out, no short cut. 1st stop: PSLE. even if u do well for PSLE, you still got olevels (for me, HMT olevels). even if u do well for olevels, you still got promos. even if you do well for promos, you still got PW. even if you do well for PW, you got prelims. even if you do well for prelims, you got A levels. even if you do well for A levels, you got university applications. even if you do well for university applications, you got job-searching.

when will this even end? honestly i think one of the main problems is myself; no one said i must get 90rp and must get into a super prestigious university. but i set that expectation for myself, and if i don't reach this, idk what ill even do. societal expectations definitely play a huge part too, but if people who live in this same society seem perfectly fine not excelling in academics and are content with not getting 90rp, not getting single digit olevel score, then surely some part of the problem, if not a huge part of it, is me?

but idk how to even solve this. any advice??? i'm literally bound to break and snap later on in the future with such sky high expectations (are these considered sky high expectations though). i'm constantly getting really bad anxiety and even though i've been doing well so far, once i've completed one hurdle/assessment, i leap into huge worry mode for the next. seems like i'm always in a perpetual loop of fear, uncertainty and anxiety.

861,[Post Exam] Got back your A level results? What now?,"I will be splitting this whole thread into a few section and it should served as a general guideline for probably most students here.

**1) Perfect result. Better than your expectation. Definitely able to get into your choice of university and courses.**

Big big congrats if you have fallen into this group. All the countless hours of muggings, revisions, consultations, time trials paid off. Your future seems bright and you are all ready to take on University in August, not unless you have NS to clear off first.  But question is, how do you make your life even better?

For those who know what course you want to get into, good for you! For those who are still not so sure, go to University open houses. But because of the Ncov situation, many open houses are becoming E-tours, so do your own research, look for courses you are interested in and the potential careers aspect. Search through reddit, forums, you should get a fair point of views if this is a path you want to head down in the long run.

Next, start looking for scholarship opportunities, Universities themselves give out scholarship, but these scholarships are a little hard to get since they are no bonds to it. Private companies, MNCs, government bodies are giving out scholarship too. Do your own research, it should save you tons of school fees and some still give allowance of covering your school fees or hostel fees!

From now till university starts, you have a good 4 to 6 months. Orientations starts in June. Get a internship to expose yourselves and start building your portfolio that is related to your uni course. For guys, you can do the exact same thing once you ORD. Building a good portfolio will allow you to stand out from your cohort once you start looking job! You can do this for your all your university holidays or even take LOA for more prestige internship opportunities.

**2) Barely scraping pass the 10th Percentile of the course you want to get into.**

You are probably scoring about 68 to 75 rank points. Your score seems to be able to get you into university but might not be able to go the course(s) you wanted to get into.

For guys - You have the luxury of trying to applying 3 times due to NS. So you can make full use of all 3 years opportunities and apply for the course you wanted to. Percentile grades are just a rough gauge, so please still go ahead and try applying to the course you want.

For girls - Unfortunately you only have 1 application this year before you officially starts, it more of a matter of luck, so try to apply all university for the course you wanted to get into and hopefully you can secure a spot for interview and a chance for you to ace the interview.

*Should you be applying for a course that you have total no interests just because your grades only allow you to get into it and you want to get into a local university?*

My recommendation is a big no. You most probably will get into University, enjoy your friends company but hate your day to day lectures, tutorials, projects due to your lack of interests in your course of study. And most probably end up doing an entire different career of what you studied.

**3) Bad result. You feel like it's the end of the world.**

You gotten back your result, you saw multiple Cs and Ds. You felt like the world is crashing down on you. Trust me, this feeling is probably worse than your first break up. But hey! It's not end of the world, your life is not going to end here, you still have to move on so pick yourself up and look through different options you have!

Option 1: Go overseas!Overseas universities requirements are much lower and you definitely can get into a course you want to. But of course, it is probably going to cost you a good 3x to 4x more than what you will incur in a local university. So if financially your family is able to afford, then yes overseas is probably one of your best bet here.

Option 2: Can't afford overseas, how?NTU, NUS, SMU are not the only universities in Singapore. UniSIM, SUTD, SIT do provide a good wide range of courses just that their school fees are a little higher but hey, you still get to experience the local vibrant university culture. Private universities (SIM, Kaplan etc) are an option too!

Yes in terms of prestige wise, local public universities might somehow gain a better recognition with companies out there, but if you have a stronger portfolio (more internships experiences, work experiences), you are definitely going to outshine someone with zero experience.

Option 3: No, i still want to go to only NTU, NUS or SMU.Okay fine! The only way this going to happen is if you retake A levels either as a private candidate or if your school allows you to join back your school current JC2 batch.

For guys if you are to retake as private candidate, you will not be able to disrupt your NS cycle and have to do it while you are in NS. If you can join back your school, then yes, you can disrupt your NS cycle and you can focus on doing well for your A this time round. BUT as a private candidate it won't be easy, whether you are heading to command school or not, you are most probably busy with ur NS life and won't have much time and simply not much energy to do well as a private candidate.

For girls, likewise, joining back a school will gain you all the assistances from school teachers and resources. If you are doing it as a private candidate, you might want to consider getting external help (Tuitions etc).

870,[rant] why am i not enough despite trying my best,"all my life, i've tried really really hard. i study hard, i do my best 

but it is never enough. no matter how hard i study, i can never be top of the class like my genius classmate. at best, my results are above average, despite working hard for it.

i don't understand. why is life so cruel? why are some people just... better than the rest? they have a superior birthright, one that has blessed them with better brains, better social skills, better everything

how do i compete with someone who i know i will never be able to match up to? the race is over, even from the start.

especially today, where jobs are only given to the best brains of the graduating batch, my lack of fortune in the lottery of life will severely impact my ability to feed my family in future

they tell me to ""just work harder"", put in more effort"", ""focus on yourself and ignore them"". don't you see? i'm working my hardest. but the results achieved by my best efforts is the equivalent of little to no effort on their part. 

life is a competition. there is no such thing as ""focus on yourself"", when your competitors are all around you. you fight for a spot in that elite school, get that coveted job position. perhaps those who say ""focus on yourself"" think that it is the key to happiness, but life is not the pursuit of happiness, it is the struggle for survival. ""happiness"" no longer takes precedence in today's world. the want to survive, and the difficulty of that feat dominates everything else, such that it is impossible to achieve both, only one. you are forced to decide between either.

maybe in another lifetime i will be one of them, those who soar above the rest of us. but not this one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/keb5qh/rant_why_am_i_not_enough_despite_trying_my_best/,True,2020-12-17 07:24:45

873,[JC] I want to Retain on purpose,"Hi I’ve been bullshitting through all my final exam papers, tday I had chem paper and I put all A’s for MCQs and left almost the whole paper blank. For the rest of the other subjects I was barely trying. What I’m intending to do is to retain on purpose. I know what u must be thinking, like what am I thinking right? For the whole of my j1 year, the thought of retaining has been on my mind. And the thing is, I’ve nvr thot of it as a bad thing at all ,despite how it’s so stigmatised. I feel that I just need more time. I don’t want to move on to j2 still struggling either, it’s gg to be so much more stressful. I want to take the next year to do everyth right, to make things better, and make it on the dean’s list. I alr know what to expect for the next cming year and I can be ahead of everybody else, I see it as an advantage. But what I haven’t told u is that I’m scared, scared to move up to j2 because I know it’s gg to be so stressful and I’m scared to see myself failing even when I’ve studied hard, so I rather not study at all that I can blame it on the fact that I didn’t study. I know I’m running away from my problems and this is the wrong way of doing things. But it’s too late, I alr screwed up too many papers, it’s most likely that I’ll retain even if I regret what I did previously. Needed someone to listen, thank u for reading this far.

875,[uni] Unsuccessful Appeal to NTU,"Hi everyone,

I just wanted to get some advice moving forward. 

In the 1st window, NTU History (2nd choice) granted me an interview and I got a rejection after 1st window on 2 June. Appealed before my outcome and now 23 June, my appeal got rejected. 

My A levels weren’t great 66.35rp (include MT). As expected got rejected from all unis.

So what should I do now? Appeal to history again? Or another subject in NTU? Honestly, just wanted to get into local Uni because it is much cheaper than private uni. I’m more into humanities

Some background:
Actually took As in 2018 and a GAP year to work in 2019. So applied this year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hecxf4/uni_unsuccessful_appeal_to_ntu/,True,2020-06-24 03:29:59
876,[o levels] some tips (for amath/emath) that may be beneficial,"firstly, im taking my o's this year. Im from an average neighborhood sec school, but i constantly top my level for both maths (not bragging just giving credibility?)

I have seen way too many students make some of these mistakes. im sure ur teachers have told you some of this mistakes countless number of times but it is vital to not make these mistakes.  


* When ur teacher is teaching/doing revision, stop copying the answer and listen. The most important thing is to understand the thinking process. There is no point copying the answer because the question can always change. but if u understand the thinking process, u can solve about any question. What i recommend is to listen to the teacher explain how he/she get the answer then copy down the answer (just the answer) then do the steps later. This way it makes u apply what u learnt and not just blindly copy. I have seen far too many students make this mistake as it seems like a natural thing. If the teacher is rushing and the question is quite difficult, u can always take a picture for reference when u need help. 

&#x200B;

* During exam, **pls** skip the question if u find it difficult. Yes ik, ur teacher probably repeated that many times. But in the exam, what u r trying to achieve is to get as many marks as possible. There is no point being stuck in the same question for 10 min and make little to no progress. Within the 10 min, u could have done 1-2 other questions. The way the marks are allocated is unfair ( will elaborate later), so grab all those easy marks first then go back to the hard questions. Personally when i look at the question, i will have a gauge of how long i will need to **think** to get the answer. If i have to think for more than 2 minute, i immediately skip the question. ( yes may sound ridiculous but thats what i do in exam) as the back may have question that doesnt require much thinking. But this may not work for everyone, i recommend spending 5 min max to think on a question.    
**Easy marks** that u should be able to get without much thinking: algebra manipulation, simultaneous equations, venn diagram, completing the square and **sketching** of graph, inequality, finding prime factors, data handling and maps.  
**Type of question that u should avoid doing first** : drawing of angle bisector, compound interest, mensuration, probability (depends on difficulty), percentage and properties of circle.  
When u skip hard questions, u will feel that u have more time and this will really help you stay calm. If u dont skip, u will realise u have lesser time to complete the other question and this is when u start to panic and get frustrated and this will really affect ur thinking. Even if u are good, under stress and panic, u wont be able to think.   
Frustration is one of the worst way to screw up your paper. Its hard to be calm again once u get frustrated. which is why it is advised to do the hard questions last. 

&#x200B;

* Know ur calculator functions. This will give u an advantage over others. Trust me not many people know the full functions of the calculator. I recommend looking at the manual. It may sound weird but this will definitely give u an edge over others. For example (im referring to fx-96SG PLUS for the functions im about to say) , u can use mode 3 1 for simultaneous equation. Or shift del to insert a function that u forgot so instead of deleting the whole thing and then re-entering  it again, this may help save some precious seconds. there are many other function such as subbing in x= any number. ( default is x=0) Just play wif it and explore.

&#x200B;

* Play to ur advantage, what do i mean by that? U should know what are ur strengths. Is it ur accuracy? or maybe ur time management? If u r those that do the paper slowly but ur answer are accurate then use that strategy. For me personally, my strategy is to rush through the paper for the first time. So i usually take around 40-50 minute to complete the paper(emath). That is because i know my accuracy is 80%+ even when i rush. So i can guarantee at least a a2(worst case scenario if i make alot of careless mistake). Then the remaining 1 hour + is spent on checking for mistake. Strategise how u going to approach the paper. 

&#x200B;

* Checking! it is as important as u doing the paper. Once again there is different way to check, there is no definite best way. Do what u find the most comfortable and effective. For me, i check by redoing the paper and looking through my steps. So yes i do the whole paper twice or even thrice. I notice that many students often leave little time to check. If u r sure u made little to no mistakes then sure but i recommend at least 30 min of checking. 

&#x200B;

* How to study for the exam. I find timed practice the most effective. If the paper is 2 hour, try to do within 1.5 h or even lesser. This stimulates the stress factor that will somewhat compensate for the stress u will experience in the exam. But more importantly, it trains u to do the paper faster so if the paper is hard, u will find it more manageable. Also when doing time based practice, i recommend using the strategy i said above. This will help u familiarize with the strategy and u feel comfortable using it. Also, it depends what u r practicing for. For example, my goal is to increase my accuracy when doing it fast. So i may give myself less than half the time to complete it and without checking. This will really make me feel more confident in the exam since i have practiced so much with the strategy.  If u need help with coming with a training plan / smt related to that, u can ask me, i can recommend training plan based on what u want to achieve. 

&#x200B;

* Being confident. What most people don't have is confidence in themselves (especially weaker students), however do note that o level emath gives the weaker students an advantage. Ur mentality and confidence is going to limit u from performing way beyond ur potential. Someone who constantly ace their math may only be 1-2 grade above someone who usually get C. However, do not think that u will immediately do well without hard work just because of that. What most people dont realise is that emath paper is easy. The determining factor is not how smart u are, but how careful u r (not being careless). Being smart does not bring that big of an advantage for emath because it is fairly easy. therefore, it usually comes down to careless mistakes. This is a note for the smarter students, don't be careless cause the gap that differentiate the weaker and the smarter is so small that any small mistake can be fatal. Weaker students, don't be too worried, u will be fine or at least better than what u would expect. but with that said, it does not mean u dont have to study. Math is a subject that require lots of practice and exposure. 

&#x200B;

* Some tips for amath : Time management is really key. Unlike emath, the steps are usually longer and more complicated. It is common if people do not finish the paper.However, amath is really systematic so the answering technique will be somewhat the same.  I recommend u plan how u r going to do the paper. For example, i think its a great idea to do question that give high marks for a shorter period of time (eg. partial fractions) . Getting exposed to various kind of question is really important as u will be able to know how to tackle the problem more efficiently. For amath the gap that differentiate the better from the average is wider. **Constant** practice will be important for amath as there are alot of things to remember that u may forget stuff if u dont do it constantly.

  
Thats all! Do note: there may be some grammatical error. I may do a part 2 with more point as it comes closer to O's. I know i could have summarised it better but im not used to giving this much tips/notes. I really tried my best and gave it my all so I hope u guys learnt something. Have a good time revising! Jiayou!

877,[Rant] Starting new,"Ik HBL has been tiring but i hope yall had to good time!

This post might be downvoted by many but i just wanted to share my feelings and opinions.

\*Let me give you some context here\* I am in J1, went to an non-IP JC which was my fifth choice and i was not very happy about it tbh. But i started my JC life with an open-mind (which was to make frens, have fun and do well in studies) which is the usual. Due to covid-19 , orientation was shortened which was a bad thing as i could not bond with my og mates. Then came my classmates. For my entire life, i have been in the nerd class, so i became one but now i am in kind of a naughty class and i could not adapt. No matter how much i try making small talks, my classmates just ans my qns and thats all. Their behaviour is a way where they have to tolerate me. I feel like they cant accept me as part of the class. I used to be extremely extroverted in sec sch and many knew me. I love being loud and acknowledged and i hated being lonely. But this sudden change as actl caused a shock in me and i became extremely insecure. I became completely introverted and i hate it and i cant change myself. I kinda entered a depressive episode where i would just cry everyday cuz i was lonely in sch. Plus, in my JC, its known that if you are not accepted in the beginning you will nvr be accepted. Now i am actl very scared to see my classmates online and idt i am ready for sch to start.

Ik many of yall would say just focus on studies and do well for alvl and leave the jc. I agree this is the main reason we all have entered JC, to do well in alvls. But as a extroverted person i love being arnd ppl and talking to them. So i feel in this hard journey to alvls isnt it btr to have someone who is going thru the same problem to be there for you?

I have also realised (after reading in reddit and talking to many) i am not the only one who is facing this problem and many are facing this problem. That got me thinking. Why is certain ppl accepted while others are ostracised? For ppl like me, being alone is painful. It practically sucks. Why cant ppl just be more accepting towards one another?

I just wanna say to those who have their own cliques and have frens, if you notice someone being alone in their class pls pls include them in. They might be a quiet person or a annoying person. You can just talk to them often in class instead of completely avoiding them or worse gossip abt them. Who knows yall might have the same interests!

What i am trying to say is as sch starts tmr, as a new start you can try to talk these ppl who have been left out by your class and include them and try to strike up convo with them. Ik yall have your frens and are in your comfort zone, but you can try as they have feelings too.

Sry if i was rude i didnt wanna come off that way! This is just my opinion. All the best for the starting of sch tmr! Thank you for reading my post!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gujsg7/rant_starting_new/,True,2020-06-02 04:30:17
878,"[Junior College] Honestly quite overwhelmed, maybe some advice?? :(","Not sure if it’s just me, or if other j1s feel the same way but:
Ever since coming to jc, I can't say that I'm having a horrible time tbh, but my thoughts have been keeping me on my toes a lot. I'm 100% aware that this is to be expected in jc, especially since I'm still trying to cope with the new environment/syllabus/pace etc, but I've been feeling quite off lately. (ngl I felt the same way in sec 1, but got over it rather quickly so I'm worried as to why I'm still feeling this)

I take H2 Bio, Math and Econs. So far there hasn't been any important tests since I'm only j1 lol, but I'm constantly feeling anxious to the point where I can’t relax, even during the weekends at home. I worry that I won't be able to keep up with my peers, or just with work in general. I've honestly never fallen behind any class in sec sch so this is scary for me haha. So far content that I've covered is still manageable, but I've been having trouble keeping up with lectures.

1. All lectures are cancelled in light of the virus situation, and all lectures are online. This is fine but the problems here are that lecture time in my timetable is all replaced by tutorials, so teachers each send like 4 30min lectures to you expecting you to finish them all in like 3 days. I’ve been falling behind because clearly I couldn’t finish them all. What can I do? :((
2. For seniors, how are your thoughts like (in terms of studying) during j1? Do you do some light study but only grind near tests/exams, or do you mug everyday? The full intensity of j1 haven’t even hit yet but this anxiety is killing me LMAO. I’m someone who works at random bursts of energy and completely rest at all other times, but I feel super guilty for not working to my fullest yet. This worked for me during Os but I’m sure it might not for As, yet I’m feeling quite exhausted already trying to catch up with everything. How was it like for you?
3. Is it possible for a jc student to be able to sleep by 12am every night? I always hear of students saying they sleep at 2—4am and I hope I can maintain my sleep throughout the two years while keeping up on work. Is weekends and holidays always all work no play? I’m just the kind of person that NEEDS at least a little play everyday or else I’ll go insane lol. I’m not looking to be a top scorer or anything, just good enough that I’m average or above.

I’ve been warned that jc will be the worst time of my life, but I was still holding on the the hope that I can have some fun and feel happy, but it seems to just be sucking the life out of me recently. I can find ways to destress, but it doesn’t last long enough before my heart starts beating again. There are good and bad days I guess, maybe it’s just negative thinking and pessimism. How did you all get over and above this? 

As of now whenever I get super anxious and my heart beats too hard, I’ll go rest and watch some YouTube or browse social media, but after that I’ll feel guilty and feel anxious again. Rinse and repeat. I’m stuck in a vicious cycle lol. Hoping to get some advice to feel better hahahaha :’)

EDIT: Hey!! I really didn’t expect this to even get to more than 10 people so the amount of responses I’m getting is quite surprising haha but just wanna say a HUGE thank you to everyone who replied!!! Ofc I can’t resolve all of my problems as of now, but I found every response very helpful and comforting!! Don’t mind more advice ;)), but just wanna show my appreciation for everyone here <3",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ffta0n/junior_college_honestly_quite_overwhelmed_maybe/,True,2020-03-10 03:31:30
879,[Post-Exams] I'm being ditched by my friends,"Not sure if this is the right place to post but whatever

So I took my o lvls in 2019, then after o lvls I went on a trip with my family so I didn't spend much time with my friends. Between o lvls and collecting results we only went to one poly open house together and I ate lunch with one of my friends and I went to buy a USS pass so I could go with my other friends ""next time"", the friend I ate lunch with didn't buy a pass because her parents didn't allow her to.

When we were collecting our results they acted normal and like they genuinely were my friends and after collecting results we went out together just to get drinks, but then they never said anything about going out after that. 

I started to suspect that they had a gc without me when 3 of them started texting in the gc I was in freaking out about something involving me (if I say what it is I'll prob expose myself). But other than that our gc was basically quiet.

So after a long time of not going out I decided to try to ask them if they wanted to go out. I asked if any of them were working and when were their days off so we could plan to meet up. But only 1 person responded, the rest blueticked me. 

A while after that I asked if any of them wanted to go out to eat, one person said maybe and the rest of them just blueticked me. 

Then the day after I asked if anyone wanted to go out to eat, one of my friend's posted an insta story. It was a video taken by one person in our friend group of another person in our friend group while she was trying to cover the camera. That 3 second video made me burst into tears.

I don't know what to say. It's not the first time I've been ditched by friends, heck I don't have any other close friends other than them, maybe it's a side effect of being a very very introverted person. Maybe that's why I'm ranting on a throwaway acc on reddit instead of to a real life person for the second time.

I hope it's a misunderstanding. But I honestly don't think so. They've blueticked me twice, gone out without me, and when I asked something as simple as what sch and course are u going? I didn't get a response. (Btw they're all going poly).

Tldr: My ""friends"" stopped hanging out with me",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f6vki9/postexams_im_being_ditched_by_my_friends/,True,2020-02-21 08:31:28
880,"[META] ""What did /r/SGExams post in 2019?"" Analysis of Submissions by Flair","**Methodology**

All submissions on /r/SGExams from January 1 2019 to December 31 2019 were retrieved using the pushshift.io API. The posts were filtered based on which had been given a flair and their post id, timestamp, full link and flair was saved to a new dataset. Analysis of data was done with Pandas with generation of charts done with matplotlib.

**Post Breakdown by Flair**

[Pie Chart of Submissions in 2019 by Flair](https://i.imgur.com/J1B6a6e.png)

Generally, the main three flairs are ""O Levels"", ""A Levels"" and ""University"", with each flair having similar proportions of subreddit submissions.

**Posts per Day (Uni, Poly, A, O)**

[Posts per Day in 2019 (Uni, Poly, A, O)](https://i.imgur.com/YGjirEm.png)

Biggest spike in activity in 2019 was during the O Level period from October to November. Other spikes in activity generally correlated with major academic events like results release, JAE, EAE, uni admissions et cetera.

/r/SGExams is most dead in the June to August period when people generally have settled into school already and extremely dead during the December period when people generally prefer not thinking about school in general.

Interestingly, you can see the educational transition from O Levels to A Levels/Poly and from A Levels/Poly to University and from University to Depression as people start asking questions and researching about the next phase in life.

**Posts per Day (Uni)**

[Posts per Day in 2019 (Uni)](https://i.imgur.com/GzTpfE7.png)

[Posts per Day in 2019 (Uni) (Annotated)](https://i.imgur.com/PlS1CBX.png)

University posts generally dominate in the Feb - April period after the JAE buzz dies down. Common topics include inter-uni discussions, inter-course discussions, administrative questions about uni and questions about uni life.

**Posts per Day (Poly)**

[Posts per Day in 2019 (Poly)](https://i.imgur.com/Oi8dTAG.png)

Peak periods of activity:
>O Level Results Release (mid-Jan)

>JAE Results Release (early Feb)

>Poly Preparations (Feb - early Apr)

>EAE (Jun - Aug)

Common topics:
>Which course should I go for?

>How is poly life?

>How does poly work (GPA, etc)?

>Administrative questions (laptops/fees)

>EAE-related questions

Interestingly activity dies down **after** poly starts in mid-April, suggesting that most posts with this flair are made with the intention of seeking information before poly starts, rather than as discussions about poly life.

**Posts per Day (A Levels)**

[Posts per Day in 2019 (A Levels)](https://i.imgur.com/IRIYbzr.png)

Peak periods of activity:
>O Level Results Release (mid-Jan)

>JAE Results Release (early Feb)

>A Level Results Release (mid-Feb)

>A Level Period (Nov)

Common topics are:

>Choosing between JCs and Subjects

>Administrative stuff (Hybrid/CCAs)

>Retaking As (private candidate etc.)

>Results emotional support posts.

>Questions about unis (see University)

>Questions about exams

>Dropping to H1

>Subject tips/tricks and questions

The signal for A Levels is much clearer than Poly/Uni, probably because of the more standardised nature. The peaks are more well-defined and there isn't a general period of random noise.

**Posts per Day (O Levels)**

[Posts per Day in 2019 (O Levels)](https://i.imgur.com/5Jnyn68.png)

Signal for O levels is clearer, similar to A Levels. The peak for actual O Levels is slightly earlier than the peak for actual A Levels, reflecting how O Levels is generally slightly staggered earlier than A Levels.

Peak periods of activity:
>O Level Results Release (mid-Jan)

>MT O Levels (early Jun)

>MT O Levels Results (mid-Aug)

>O Levels (Oct to mid-Nov)

Common topics:

>JAE Questions

>Poly vs JC

>Which JC?

>JC subject combis

>Results discussion

>Retaking MT papers

>Tips and tricks for exam papers

>Emotional support posts

**Conclusion**

/r/SGExams lives up to its name: a discussion board for Singapore exams and academic-related queries. I genuinely doubt that anyone is surprised by this but hey, at least now it's backed by data!

881,[JC] My CJ Story,"Here we go....

Hello everyone, CJ has somewhat of a bad rep here (and everywhere tbh) but I do want to offer you my own experiences there as I do believe that it is important for those who are going to CJ, either by choice or not, to know that it's not all doom and gloom at 129 Whitley Road. I am honestly puzzled as to why there has been an uptick in posts saying CJ is bad - I did not see any when I was about to enter CJ. But i digress. Again, this is MY own experience. 

Background: CJC Class of 2020, Arts Stream, Ignite class.

&#x200B;

**1. Class Environment**

Let me start with the place where you'd spend most of your time in - the classroom. I do truly believe that not one class in CJ is identical - your experience might differ from classroom to classroom. For me, personally, my class was not very bonded - reason being that my class had like 10 different subject combinations (I even had one classmate whom I did not share any lesson with). However, we were still very friendly and cordial to one another, and we were still very supportive of one another - for example we had a shared Hist essays bank etc. Most of the classes in CJ are quite fine - obviously some classes had more 'problematic' people than others but it's not by any means bad, from what I have heard.

&#x200B;

**2. School Environment**

Yes, it is true that there were  'popular' kids and 'social climbers' in the school. Yes, there was a semblance of a social hierarchy in place. But here's the kicker: none of my friends and I gave a rat's ass about that. It was by no means as bad as I've heard some people describe it to be - maybe at the start of J1 some people tried to reach the pinnacle of popularity but come CCAs and exams most people were too busy with their own stuff that they couldn't care less about this 'social hierarchy'. Maybe my batch was different from the current batch but yeah that was my experience. In terms of culture and vibrancy, it's a bit tough now cus of COVID but before that we had a lot of events like Rockafella and Sports Carnival that imo made life in CJ very enjoyable. There qwew more and more people who mugged nearing Prelims and A's. Prior to COVID we had night studies with food from the PSG so that was nice. 

&#x200B;

**3. Teachers and Academics**

I believe this would be the most polarising section of all. In my opinion, my CJ teachers were the best I've ever encountered. I came from an elite secondary school and my CJ teachers blew my secondary school teachers out of the water. Every single one of my teachers was very caring and attentive to our needs, and they really tried their best. They were really dedicated and they pushed us a lot and gave those in need of help a lot of attention. They always entertained consultation requests and were open to questions. Now, of course, there were less ideal teachers - I have heard of some stories. But, in general, I'd say that many teachers in CJ are good, with some being the best I've ever encountered. In terms of notes, some notes were a bit outdated and messy, but they were sufficient in my opinion. The teachers would also give us a lot of extra information during lectures and tutorials so they made up for the missing info on the notes. 

&#x200B;

**4. Facilities**

Old, but sufficient.

&#x200B;

**5. CCAs**

Sports CCAs don't really have a lot of accomplishment but ofc it's hard to compete with all the top JCs. All Performing Arts CCAs received distinction in 2019 SYF so that's good.

&#x200B;

**6. Arts vs Science**

Probably the most popular question about CJC. There is a reason why CJ is the only JC that has a lower Arts COP than Science. Yes, it is true - CJ's Arts stream has consistently performed better than the Science stream. The Arts departments are very good (which admittedly have skewed my experience there) and their results are commendable, most notably Lit and ELL. 

I'm not gonna sit here and lie that CJ's Science dept is all fine and dandy - I do believe that there are some work that needs to be done in order for it to catch up with the Arts side. 

&#x200B;

But, at the end of the day, I do believe that your journey in JC and your eventual A Level results depend on you and you only - if you don't put in the effort you'll most likely fail, no matter where you are. If you already have a preconceived notion that a particular JC is bad, you'd suffer. I guarantee it. In fact, i used to LOATHE CJ. I wanted to quit. I really did. This was until I found a reason to stay - my CCA. And just like that, my mind was changed - yes, I could see that CJ has its flaws but I learned to make best of what I had and as a result, I had THE best 2 years of my life in CJ. I am sitting here typing reminiscing about my times there and how badly I want to turn back the clock.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kx6f10/jc_my_cj_story/,True,2021-01-15 06:15:41

883,[JC] Should I retain or change to poly?,"I've been thinking about retaining for quite some time now and the main reason is that I've completed wasted J1 playing and barely studied. And by that I meant that I only studied the week right before exams so I basically have almost zero recollection of whatever I've learnt. Now that school is starting, I realised that I probably would not be able to catch up considering how fast paced J2 is and the fact that I have to cram 2 years of content into 1. I know that some people would say just continue J2 and repeat if it's really undoable but for me I'm highly sure I won't be able to do it. I feel like I need a fresh start to get myself together and cramming everything in J2 just won't do it for me. 

I'm also thinking of changing my subject combi if I retain because I really dislike most of the subjects I'm studying right now but I'm not sure it that's a good idea? 

I'm also thinking of going poly instead and taking up a media/design related course because it seems quite interesting to me. But my main issue is that money is tight in my family right now and I would need to get a scholarship in order to go the poly route. And does anyone know how poly scholarships work, like must you pay the full amount of fees first then they reimburse you back the money later? And how hard is it to get a poly scholarship based on your grades (I'm assuming they would look at O level grades or does it work differently for people coming from JC?) since I don't exactly have the best testimonial in sec sch (just student council and a cca exco member)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kszr0i/jc_should_i_retain_or_change_to_poly/,True,2021-01-09 02:16:41

886,[O levels] Read this before going into the exam Hall!,"You guys may have seen me post a few stuff on this subreddit before haha giving all sorts of advice! Even though the flair says O levels, this applies to every student out there that is going to take their national exams soon! Hope this short text could boost yall and give you all some confidence! :)



My mum always told me, ""尽力就好了"" (just try your best). Being the Secondary 4 me last year, I realised how important it is to really give your best in whatever you do. For context, I wasn't the brightest student in class and my grades weren't that great. I was quite a well behaved student though, studied everyday, put my phone aside when I am studying just so that I will not get distracted. My mum could kind of see the change in me and was honestly quite glad to see that I am putting in the effort. 


Fast forward to O level results day, I saw my result slip and I felt relieved. My results were mediocre but I was honestly happy because my L1R5 improved by 13 points. When I told my mum my results, she was happy for me and said, ""你的努力得到结果了""。(your hard work bore fruit)



Trust me, the purpose of this post is not to flex the improvement of my results. The real question is, throughout the whole journey of your secondary school life/JC life, did you really try your best? Touch your heart and ask, did I really try my best? If you did, congrats cus you have nothing to lose! If you didnt, why? Is it because you did not have the motivation to carry on? 



Anyway, what's done cannot be undone. You guys may feel apprehensive of your results and may ask ""oh what is the moderation like blah blah"". Trust me, nobody knows the exact range and don't fret over it too much as it only makes you more and more anxious. For me, I took it with the mindset of it being like a normal school exam. 


Ok thats all! I wish all the best to the students taking their O's and the A level students who are taking their exams in November! JIAYOUS👊👊

still going through promos now, but jus curious, if i retain. would being a retainee affect my chance of entering certain courses in uni?

&#x200B;

the only subject that i honestly think i'm good in is english and thats only because im an aspiring author and i'm currently searching for publishers so i have some,,, skill, i guess u could say??? cuz i write almost every day. idk. i'm just struggling for physics and chem. i think my emath is okay??? i'm looking at an A1 tbh but i feel like a failure if i can't get it. anyway, i'm just,,, so tired and so stressed out. i dropped my math/science/english tuition teacher 2 or 3 months ago and i've only had that amount of time to relearn everything i had to learn from sec3-4 and i'm just... drained. i feel like i've lost my personality.

892,[Junior college] rant about my school counsellor,"Throwaway account, don’t want to exposed myself, or even my school.

Background: Struggled with anxiety since O’s, got diagnosed and been taking medicine eversince. Often i do get panic attacks during school, especially in J1. I did inform my FTs about my condition and THANKFULLY they have been understanding and supportive of my situation! for instance whenever I get panic attacks, they will accompany be down (and also allow me to walk the secret pathway aka only teachers can access LOL, so that i can be away from the general crowd) to the counsellor room so I can have a safe space and rest. The previous school counsellor was very nice and often allow me to use her room whenever i have a panic attack.

However..... now i’m in J2 and my school has changed to a new counsellor and boi, I had a really terrible experience (is it far stretch for me to say traumatic?) I had a really horrible panic attack recently and quickly rushed to the counsellor room as per usual. When she came in, (although I was bawling my eyes out looking like crap) she asked me to get out of the room and sit outside WHERE IT WAS SUPER EXPOSED. Mind you, none of my friends/classmates knows about my ‘condition’ and I don’t want to risk exposing myself. I politely ask her whether it is possible for me to stay in the room, but she brush it off saying that it’s unfair for me to just waltz in when there’s other people who have anxiety as well and want to use the room (i’m guessing she didn’t believe my anxiety was legit lol) and mention about some safety issue or whatever nonsense because she don’t like students just walking in W/O BOOKING TO MEET HER FOR COUNSELLING 

Anyways, I kept pushing on saying that i really need to stay inside, it was just too scary for me to go out at that point of time, and i swear she just walk out in midst of my explanation and probably ask around about my situation. I’m guessing she contacted my FT to ‘confirmed’ about my situation. Lmao sis i ain’t kidding, she came back in and say “oh i just found out you have anxiety, and apparently this episode happens quite often during school” i… just…... well she end up letting me use the room while she go off for her meeting but i’m like AIGHT IMMA HEAD OUT

I’m not here to doxxed my school counsellor or anything, and maybe it’s just my anxiety speaking, but i have this fear that she will exposed my condition to the majority of the school population especially since i found today through my FT that she insisted to contact my psychiatrist and want to discuss about my condition (and she don’t allow any of my FTs to be in contact with my psychiatrist) i just pray that i don’t have any more panic episode during school hours, and when i do, i just wish i’m allowed to go home and avoid all this mess.

TL;DR- bad experience with new school counsellor, was skeptical about my anxiety and didn’t really understand what is ‘safe space’ to me.

Edit: grammar, lol typed too fast

Edit pt 2: thank you everyone who took their time to read this long rant! and thank you those who comment/PM me really kind words! Let me clarify, yes i did inform my FTs about the incident, albeit, i was really hesitant and scared even to tell them about what happen lol. Both of them decided to speak with the school counsellor regarding this matter. And NO.....(for now at least) I don’t have the emotional strength to file a complain to any related authority, i’m still in a ‘shock’ after that incident (god damn anxiety). my intention for this post was to share my experience and never to get her fired/doxxed even, i just hope that to anyone who wish to pursue this career in dealing with mental health at a school setting, if you don’t have a lick of empathy in your blood pls reconsider lol",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ffvvic/junior_college_rant_about_my_school_counsellor/,True,2020-03-10 06:56:24
893,[a levels] nightmare,"yesterday i had my first nightmare after a levels. i dreamt that i did not do an entire essay question for my econs and history paper due to a lack of time and i went home to cry and ponder on what went wrong. i woke up from the horror and luckily i remembered that it wasn’t true in reality (not that it went well either, but at least not as bad). so. terrifying.

I wish I was exaggerating when I say I will probably fail my H2 Physics paper because I've been consistently doing badly for it, with my highest grade  merely being a D. I realise the huge number of mistakes i made too in both the practical and Paper 2 already and honestly do not have high hopes that the remaining two papers will save my grade (considering i scored a 9/30 for Paper 1 during Prelims and only got a D for it because my practical pulled up my grade). With that being said, I do not wish to retake A levels if i fail either because JC has been so bad for my mental health that the thought of going through it an additional year is pushing me towards a 2hr break down session. I keep trying to comfort myself by saying that grades is not really everything but I just fear that I won't have a future anywhere at all at this rate, especially with how Singapore is such an academic-oriented society where grades really do seem to define us....

896,[O Levels] REALLY IMPORTANT ADVICE,"Hi just wanted to let all of you know.  I have something really important to share with y'all and I think it's a good way to proceed on with papers and excel with your next papers weather you are taking O Lvls or A Lvls. 

1) DO NOT worry about the bell curve.  It's NOT about how other people do.  It's about you. Why do I say this?  It's simple,  based on looking at other people's grades or previous cohort grades , I realised that bell curve DOES nor affect someone's grades that much. A 75% to 80% is mostly enough for A1. Hence your prelim grades are mostly a replica of ur o levels grades.

2) MORE IMPORTANT: so before your exam you should have some sort of idea of how u should perform.  Maybe let's say you want to be able to answer 90% questions with what u believe is correct.  So during the exam this expectation SHOULD NOT change however difficult the paper is. If the paper is too difficult and you exit the exam room and realise you didn't meet ur initial expectation then it's time to reflect before ur next paper.  It's obviously not a time to be sad whatsoever.  But rather a time to reflect on how you went wrong. This helps you self improve and better prepare urself for ur next exam. Also the expectation should not vary during or after the paper because maybe you think the paper was way too hard or way too easy and the bell curve will be insane.  ITS NEVER ABOUT THE BELL CURVE but it's all about YOU. so don't comfort with the  curve being nice to you. 

Reason? 
If you do think in this way your expectations will not drop for your next paper and will not give your next paper your best shot thinking that you can afford to lose some marks. What this creates is a vicious cycle where your expectations start to drop on and on and finally you start to expect a pass rather than your A1 expectation for ur first ppr. The expectations should remain and it's all about wether u meet or don't meet the expectation. 

For example if I want to be able to do all the qns for A math this yr paper but ended up not being able to do 3 qns,  it means that I prepared for the later such that I was supposed to be able to do all qns. Hence I didn't meet my expectations and will be honest Abt my opinion.  For next paper chemistry I will not let my expectations decrease as i know i have to meet my expectations for chemistry and will do far better after reflecting on my mistakes and how I underperformed.  

This is called mutually exclusive events whr one of ur papers so not affect ur expectations for the other.  I'm really sorry if this comment wasn't structured properly as I was rushing thr it. Do feel free to clarify. This was one of the morals or ways of thinking I have learnt from some research papers and found it really useful for my exams!

Feel free to clarify and ATB for ur exams!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jm4qic/o_levels_really_important_advice/,True,2020-11-02 08:08:26
897,[O Levels] To all those taking PSLE/O-levels/A-levels or other major exams,"Hello, I’m currently a student in a private university. Personally, I’m not a studious type. I’ve gotten 194 for PSLE and 20 for L1R4 (O-levels). 

When I got a bad grade for PSLE, I did not care as I got into the express stream in a neighbourhood school. This continued till secondary 4 when I took my O levels. I only studied 2 weeks before and I got a bad grade. But still studies and academics wasn’t my concern. I was happy that I got into accepted into a polytechnic. 

In poly, I was too relaxed as my exams is mostly open book. Instead of having academics as my main concern, I was more concerned about finances and money. I worked part time while schooling. Whenever I have time, I find work. I did not study at all. My poly life is 50% of relaxing and 50% of work. I’m lucky that I didn’t have to take another year. 

My final gpa was a 2.3. I failed to enter any of the local universities. I then realised what will happen and worry about my future. I was worried that i couldn’t find a job. After seeing my grades, I have this sudden motivation to study hard. I’m in a private uni now. But to me, it’s my final chance of succeeding.

899,[A levels] [JC] 8808 Project Work Results Release 2020,"Hi all. As heard from the media, schools, teachers & friends, tomorrow is the day we receive our H1 Project Work result! And this is really a major milestone towards the A levels (MTL also of course, but uk 😉) 

Whatever results we get, we shall accept it as I believe we have already did our best! There’s still our main papers at the EOYs to complete and they are way more important. Hence, we should not be complacent/disheartened and continue to press on! 

Times have been tough for many of us last year, perhaps from countless of WR rejections, group discussions and OP with critical feedbacks, which may have forced many of us to hate PW. I’m really thankful to the teachers & friends who have supported us through this. All the best for the results tmr & do stay safe!!

901,[Post-Exams] I have recently accepted the fact that I am likely transgender and I am unsure of what to do,"I am a J1 who was born a male, but ever since I was young I have always felt and wanted to be more like a girl. I loved playing with dolls and watching shows like Winx club. While my parents thought it was just a phase, looking back now I think they may have been serious red flags. I often fantasized about having long hair and wearing a dress, and would always picture myself as a girl whenever I was thinking something. 

Things got worse in secondary school. I was in an all boy's school, and I couldn't understand them at all. I didn't share their liking for sports and generally other masculine behaviour. I would always be the only one rushing to the toilet to change for pe, and I would always insist on wearing a full swimsuit during swimming lessons. I used to think it was because I was just insecure and shy, but now I believe it was because I didn't want to reveal my masculine body, possibly because I haven't accepted the fact that I am not a female and never will be. 

Puberty was one of the most traumatizing experience in my life. I hated my voice that was deepening and felt it was not representative of my actual personality and inner voice at all. I hated the fact that I was growing facial hair, pubic hair and armpit hair as I felt repulsed by them. It got me to severe bouts of depression because of that. 

And yes, I am attracted exclusively to males as well (Which is why I could never quite relate to my horny male classmates). However, I do believe in heterosexual relationships- I just see myself as being at the wrong side of the equation. This is why I am inclined to see myself as a transwoman rather than just a feminine gay man. And talking about that, I do always feel uncomfortable getting called things like ""man"", ""boy"", and ""son"" so that's even more evidence that I am transgender. 

Now that I am in a coed JC, I feel really uncomfortable being unable to fully relate with my female classmates as they still think of me and treat me as a masculine entity. Its like an itch I can't scratch, and gender expectations of me are higher than ever. More importantly, I am unsure of how to get out of this hellhole of depression. My parents and teachers  are extrmeley religious and homophobic, so coming out will be a no no. I'm also unsure of whether being trans will affect my career prospects.

902,[JC] NYJC J1s are...,"tldr: ... damn 凶🥵🥵

Hi people I’m currently a J1 in NYJC and didn’t expect the mugging culture to happen on just the first week of lecture. It is just the first week of lectures and there are so many (LIKE LITERALLY SO MANY) J1s that are reading ahead and mugging. I heard that for first few weeks of JC we should just enjoy our time before hell starts. Now the mugging culture feels like hell to me, everyone is so competitive and I get that its a good influence but it kind of makes me stressed out? Is anyone in NY feeling the same way? Is it just my class people? Should I start mugging too?

904,[O Levels] I need to raise my L1R4 from 19 to at least 9 points,"i’m taking my o levels this year, and i’m very worried. i didn’t know what i wanted to do after i finished secondary school, which is probably why i slacked off with my studies last year in sec 3. i got 27 points for my l1r5, and 19 points for my l1r4. 

at the beginning of this year, i figured out what i wanted to do. the range of points required for the course is 5 to 9 for this year (sp dtvm), and i’m worried if i can achieve those results within this year. 

i’m quite weak in pure chemistry (i got c6 for eoy) and i failed both e math and a math (both d7). my english and humanities are not that bad (both b4), and for pure bio i got a2.

906,[a levels] anxiety about results gosh,"
hi guys this isn’t really a rant but i just wanted to get this anxiety off my chest. So i did relatively well in prelims and obviously i expected equal or up to par performance in my alevels. But i feel like i’m seriously underperforming like heck when i ask my friends how the paper went, they would say they checked the answers and scored super well like high 80s ish and this kinda made me scared considering they were scoring Us in prelims and i was scoring a B and now i’m suddenly performing much worse than they are  in alvls ?? Like it’s not that i wish for them to do worse than me or something but when this happens it makes me feel so scared about my results like there’s not stability and others can easily overtake u ?? I’m just so worried that in the end they end up taking the A while i take a B instead despite performing better in prelims (i’m just scared of falling short of expectations not that i wish for them not to get an A) but like idk man... is anyone experiencing or going through the same issues as me and just feel super insecure about their results (bec damn i’m so insecure and downright not confident man) 

furthermore, the whole speculation on A graded and rank just makes it worse because now it feels like an A grade is further and more out of reach for me now. i’m sorry this paragraph is so scattered and incoherent i’m just too HEKDKSKS

ps: i know i shouldnt have asked man BUT I CANT MY MOUTH ITCHY IT WANTS TO KNOW HOW OTHERS R DOING 😭😭

907,[Uni] Rejected by all local unis and i dont know what to do:(,"I didnt well for my alevels and ended up with an rp of 66.25 sigh. I was an arts hybrid student and i applied for NTU, NUS, SMU, SUTD and SUSS and i was rejected by all of them except SUSS, where they offered me an interview for their marketing course, but im currently on their reserve list. i feel absolutely dejected and im super worried that i wouldnt be able to get into a uni this year.

I will be trying to appeal and so far i have submitted my appeal for NTU biz (i know my grades do not meet the requirements but i have heard of people with lower rps that have gotten in + their intake is quite large so im hoping for a chance as this is what i am genuinely interested in). I have also submitted an appeal for NUS real estate.

Is there anyone in the same situation as i am? and do you guys think that my appeals might be successful? I will also be appealing into smu but im not sure what course yet... is there anyone with a rp similar to mine that has gotten into smu?

910,"[rant] “don’t lie, you confirm get A”","i seriously feel like i have no one to talk to that will understand so whats up im on reddit now! (made a new acc for this cus my name made my identity obvious) anyways story time:

i wasnt the brightest kid in primary school and im in NA now. I was determined to do well from then on and ended up being one of the top few students in my batch. My school standard is a little low so i was still failing subjs and just barely passing some even when i was somewhat a ‘top’ student. i didnt make it to PFP and ended up going to sec 5. 

now that im in sec 5 taking my olvls, people think its easy for me just because i was considered a ‘top’ student in school. my results are usually ard 16-19 points for L1R4 which i feel like its decent but not good enough cus i failed miserably for EAE and needed to rely on JAE lol. plus, I only have 6 subjs and i technically only have 5 subjs to depend on because my chinese is terrible lolsss (usually getting F9). its not v good even tho i tried for olvls so im not planning to put it in L1R4. i usually score well for sciences because it is my strongest subj but i seriously got so upset and frustrated at myself after my physics paper. for some reason, i just couldnt do the whole paper and i wanted to get a good grade since its my best subj anyways. im seriously so upset because ppl in my class found it easy while i found the paper challenging asf. and i usually score one of the top in my class for my science but now im so disappointed in myself because everyone in my class could do the paper except me.

the worst thing is.. when my friends were taking abt the answers (all of them saying the same answers while im getting them all wrong), my friends just said ‘dont lie lah u confirm get A’. 

i get what they mean by that cause there are many students that say they are gonna fail and go to ITE and shit when they end up w jc standard results and the top in class whatsoever. but if someone ACTUALLY messed up in a paper even tho they’ve been scoring decent marks before, no one actually believes them or cares cus everyone thinks the smart student will never make mistakes or smth and that they are just ALWAYS lying abt it being ‘hard’. people didn’t believe that i couldnt do the paper just because ive been doing well in the past.. Its like i need to score badly before so that they can show sympathy for me when i cant do my paper now. 

FURTHERMORE TO RUB SALT INTO THE WOUND, SOME bio students say that ‘its easy for physics students because yall just apply fomulas’ and that rlly pisses me off cus physics is easy for them but ive been struggling to understand physics LOLOL so i feel so bad abt myself when they say its easy cus i still cant do my physics properly :// i honestly think that bio and physics are difficult in their own ways uhh so plsss dont say physics is easier

i know there will still be people that say ‘shut up lah youre just going to get A stop lying’ but seriously if i was one of those ppl then idt i would bother typing all this out. not like im gonna update yall w my results either. so its not like im trying pretend its easy or some shit, i just wanted ppl to understand how i feel. 

anyways thats all, i dont want people to pity me but i want to know how yall feel abt this cause maybe i portrayed myself in a bad light or smth idk i dont want to seem like a bad person and stuff.. i just wanted to rant because i felt alone and i dont like ppl having high expectations for me or think that im lying when i make mistakes. buttttttt i wont think about it anymore because its not like i can do anything about it too!! i was just upset over the situation that people thought i was lying abt it being hard thats all

im gonna try to stay positive and try to do well for mcq cause mcq helps a lot so my science is not totally ded yet! So if some of yall think that yall messed up the science paper, dont worry cause mcq can really help u pass and jump grades

thank you for wasting your precious time reading my rant bahahaa i hope all of you do well and achieve the results yall want! just a few more papers and we are done w olvls too so yayyyyy!! its been stressful for everyone so the gov better give all of us free hotel stays after olvls !!

edit: i RLLY RLLY appreciate that yall are sharing your stories and can relate to me too!!! i cant reply to everyones comments but just know that i rlly am thankful that yall have smth to share, it really made me feel better and i dont regret typing out my rant now

913,[A Level] H2 Physics Practical Notes — A Compilation of Things You Should Know Before You Step into the Laboratory Tomorrow,"This should only help you for your last minute preparation, sort of like a compilation you read before you submit to fate. The author is **neither certified nor qualified** to be teaching H2 Physics, and this set of notes does not come with any sort of guarantee. With that said, the author hopes you have **as much fun** reading this as he did typing and collating this.

&#x200B;

Now, this set of notes is slightly different from the one for H2 Chemistry — H2 Physics P4 is less predictable (I think), so this contains less content, and is focused more on the techniques you can employ to approach the commonly-tested questions.

&#x200B;

Last thing: The previous time when I posted the H2 Chemistry Practical compilation, it was a huge mess with—and I'm going to suppose no one here deliberately tried to delete paragraphs of texts/tried to plagarise my work—a lot of accidental suggestions made, so this time around, I am releasing this document as 'view only'.

915,[O LEVELS] to those who didn't do well for their mt o lvls,"So I've been reading through the posts on reddit about the mt olvl results and something rlly common would be comments on how seab screwed up and people who were normally A standard dropped to a B and below. I just don't rlly get why ppl are putting the blame on seab. Everyone took the same paper, everyone had the same amount of type so why would SEAB screw up on one paper and not the other? Maybe instead of lamenting about your grades, y'all should put more focus on how to improve your grades.

 And btw by saying seab screwed up, you're putting down the rest of the ppl who did do well, who got their As. Even if you didn't see them putting in hard work for their mt, the results show the efforts. Everyone tried their best, even if they didn't show it. Instead of being salty about your own results, pls try to be happy for others too. 

For those who worked hard and didn't get do well, it could just be that one component didn't do well and it affected the rest too.  Esp since the paper this time was pretty tricky and unlike a math paper, mt papers have no right wrong. Maybe you feel like you wrote the write answers, your compo was on point but in actual fact the markers didn't agree. 

For those who complain that their oral topic was the hardest eg the extreme sports one, have you looked at this from another viewpoint. What if you did prepare for this topic yet another foreign topic came out wouldn't you feel that your topic was hard too. Everyone studied for different topics and everyone got different topics. Maybe you prepared maybe you didn't but don't push the blame for your oral on your topic bc there's definitely ppl who did the same topic and scored well.

917,[Rant] Please just be kind to everyone!!💖😭,"Just a thought......

We need a lot more kindness in this world. Sometimes small little things matter and make a positive difference, things like upvoting or giving someone a few words of encouragement can make someone's day. And a little kindness goes a long way!! Kindness also has a positive impact on someone's mental health: people who have not been treated kindly by their peers are more likely to fall into depression or have social anxiety. In addition, there has been a psychological study on the impact of kindness on society: [https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/february-2018/kindness-societys-golden-chain](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-31/february-2018/kindness-societys-golden-chain)

I think there was a recent article sharing resources relating to mental health by a Reddit user who has lost his or her friend to suicide which made me think about while it is important for the person to get help for their mental health, it is also important for others to be civil, respectful and kind especially when the person treats other in the same way. Treat others the same way you wish to be treated, at least that is what I believe: and I believe many people, like I, treat others with kindness as we want to be treated with kindness.

I believe many people in this world have the capacity to be nice and kind and help make society a kinder and safer space for all!

It starts with you and me. Thank you. 🙏✨🌻

Sending you all love!💖

P.S. If anyone that is feeling depressed or wants to talk to someone, you can PM me!! I'm here for you, stay strong!!💪💖

918,[poly] How to calculate ur sem 1 GPA!,"Hello! I'm not sure if a post like this has been done before but I thought I'd just do one to help all those year 1 poly kids who are still figuring out how to calculate their gpa! Here's what you need to know.

What are modules? Modules are basically ""subjects"" but in uni/poly terms. So for example, if you were doing a Diploma in Cat Science, you'd probably have modules like ""Introduction to Cat Breeds"" or ""Cats: A Global Perspective"" etc. Each semester, you do different modules. To make this easy, I'll use an example for this. Say, you only have 3 modules this semester: Module A, B and C.

Each module will have ""credits"" which in simple term means ""weightage"".  From my experience ""credits"" are usually how many hours per week these modules are. For eg, if you have only 2 hours of Module A classes per week then the credit/weightage of Mod A would be 2. This might vary across schools.

For your 3 modules this sem, the credits are:

Module A has 2 credits

Module B has 4 credits

Module C has 6 credits

Your scores for the 3 modules are as follows:

Mod A: B+

Mod B: C+

Mod C: A

So, from all these letters, how do we compute a GPA which is in numerals?  Each grade has a “point” assigned to it.

A= 4

B+= 3.5

B= 3

C+= 2.5  .. so on and so forth.

**Once you understand all these, there are only 2 main steps needed to calculate you GPA! First, you need to take each module's ""credits"" multiplied by the corresponding “grade point” you acheived for that module.** Example:

Module A is a 2 credit module which you scored B+ which is also 3.5points. So you take 2x3.5.

Module B is a 4 credit module which you scored C+ which is also 2.5points. So you take 4x2.5.

Do that for Module C... You will get: (2x3.5)+(4x2.5)+(6x4) = 41points. 41 is the total number of ""grade points"" you have achieved for this semester.

**Finally, to calculate the final semester's Grade Point Average (GPA), You take all the points (41points) and divide it by the total number of ""credits"" you have in the semester, thus ""averaging"" out**. In this case, you have taken 3 mods with credits totaling up to (2+4+6)= 12 credits.   So 41/12 = 3.41!

Tada! That is your GPA for the semester.

PS: Only the overall grade for the module matters. Each module has components (or assignments) that add up to 100% which forms your overall grade. So, even if you did score 0 for a 20% component or assignment, you'd still be able to achieve a maximum percentage of 80% (A Grade) if you scored full marks for ALL your other assignments within that module. I really hope this helps! All the best!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gsoy1p/poly_how_to_calculate_ur_sem_1_gpa/,True,2020-05-30 00:24:56
919,"[Uni] Polytechnic to University: Daily Life, Differences and Similarities","I'm an Accountancy student from SP looking to further studies hopefully in NTU or SMU. I want to prepare myself mentally in advance because I heard of how even my JC schoolmates from secondary school are all worn out from 'the grind' of JC, but university life is supposedly even worse.

Main things I'm curious about:

1. Daily life in University - Is it '9-5' i.e. similar to polytechnic with small breaks in-between, or is it much more intensive than polytechnic? AND if you live some distance away, say, in Boon Lay, but studying in SMU, is student accommodation a must if one doesn't want to become a walking zombie?
2. CCAs - How much more important is it compared to in polytechnic? Could I join an event-based CCA (kinda like a volunteer group, etc) and expect my CCA records to look good?
3. Projects - how much of these comprise of your results?
4. Competition - I expect university to be very competitive and that is fine, but are fellow peers around you doing ***everything*** *-* marking others down in peer evaluations, refusing to let groupmates speak for Q&A etc *-* they can to get an A? This is a legitimate fear of mine due to past experiences of myself and classmates and I have anxiety so... kinda paranoid, no offence. Basically - is the competitive spirit of university healthy or is it unhealthy?
5. **How hard is it to get As?** \- Or, alternatively, a relatively good cumulative score equivalent to a 3.8 GPA in Polytechnic. In a class of 20, how many would get As in an average module/subject?
6. Upon graduation - How are the job offers like? Did you get any? What must a student score to get a solid career start?

920,Latecoming experience from actual hell. Please share your crazy latecoming stories too! [Rant],"Since i’m always on the verge of being late, my FT asked me to try and take an earlier bus. So, that’s what i did. The usual bus i take comes around 6:47 so i decided i would arrive at 6:33 and wait for the 6:37, 6:42, or 6:45 buses. Come 6:37... no bus in sight. 6:42, still nothing. 6:45... nothing. What really threw me off was at 6:47 (my usual bus), THERE WAS STILL NO BUS. At 6:50, i witnessed the glorious sight of 3 buses conveniently bunched together. The first bus was COMPLETELY packed with people while the other 2 were practically empty. 

I ended up missing the early bus to school even though i RAN THE DISTANCE BETWEEN 2 STOPS just in the hopes of catching it.

922,"[Junior College] When there is a will, there is a way.","Hello to everyone who’s applying to a JC. If you’re a 2020 sec 4 or even a junior who’s leaning towards the arts stream but scared for your future, read this!
(post inspired by fellow redditor who was reconsidering taking helm)


Choosing my subject combination was tough. I experienced internal conflicts. So I just wanna share my journey in choosing my subject combination.


[JAN] I started my sec 4 year in 2020. Having an older sibling who started J1 and took PCME (the common one), everyone was agreeable to his combination, of course. So when my family said “how about you?” I just said BCME since I don’t take Physics. This was when I realised I had to start narrowing down my JC options. 


[FEB] I knew I had a passion for Geography so in February I was considering BCME and BCMG (I find it so weird now that I typed my interest in these combinations in February 2020)


[SEP] Fast forward to September, I heard about hybrid combinations and I was looking forward to take one, because I realised my forte for the humanities and how I wasn’t really enjoying/understanding Bio. So by now my plan was to take GCME.


[JAN 21] I was almost certain about this combination. I felt like I completed my journey of exploring my abilities and interests. Until results day came. My results looked like humanities, languages, math: a good grade while science: the grade below that grade


So it was becoming increasingly clear my forte was the humanities. Then I became more willing to enter the arts stream. Furthermore arts stream Cut Off Points are higher so I had more JC choices if I enter the arts stream. Almost everything pointed to the arts stream. But wait what about Chem, the *safe* subject? For courses, jobs, etc.?



After some consultations with people, I ended up putting the arts stream in my first choice. Here is why: 

- There are several courses for arts students. I’m not sure about other local universities (haven’t found the info yet) but I found that on NTU’s site, you can search the course and it would have a section on job prospects. So I searched up courses that I can do.
The list of job prospects is quite promising!

- I asked an NUS graduate, who studied Environmental Studies (which needs H2 Chem). He said that the course takes in students without JC Chem! You would just need to take a Chem bridging module and have the passion for the course. (Although I think this might be harder for Medicine and those stuff)

- Lastly, 50% of Singaporeans are taking jobs unrelated to their degrees. So a degree is just like their foundation. So you can still survive.

If I think of more reasons I’ll update this.

929,[O Levels] Unable to sleep,"I'm not stressed or anything, I just took a 4 hour power nap and now I can't fall asleep. To cope with this sudden insomnia, I'm going to list down all my bio points for everyone else's reference because I want everyone to do well.

Gene:
A gene is a sequence of nucleotides, small segment of DNA which controls the formation of a single polypeptide. 

DNA: 
A molecule carrying genetic code. It has a double helix structure comprised of two polynucleotide strands. Each nucleotide in a polynucleotide strand contains a nitrogenous base, deoxyribose sugar and a phosphate group. The rules of base pairing is adenine pairs with thymine and cytosine pairs with guanine. 

Chromosome: 
A chromosome is a thread-like structure made up of DNA. A DNA molecule wrapped around proteins forms a chromatin thread.

How transgenic bacteria is produced:
Example: Insulin-producing bacteria
A human insulin gene is extracted from human DNA using restriction enzymes, which produces sticky ends on the insulin gene. Then, a plasmid is extracted from bacteria and cut with the same restriction enzyme, producing sticky ends complementary to those of the human insulin gene. The insulin gene is then inserted in the plasmid and sealed with DNA ligase. The recombinant plasmid is then inserted back into the bacteria by subjecting the bacteria to temporary heat or electric shock, which opens up small holes in its cell membrane for the plasmid to go through. The transgenic bacteria is then placed into the fermenter (broth, temperature and pH level etc. of the fermenter must be kept constant) to reproduce into generations of transgenic bacteria.

Homeostasis:
The maintenance of a constant internal environment which is independent from external changes.

When blood glucose level deviates from the norm:
When blood glucose concentration deviates from the norm, this stimulates the Islets of Langerhans (correct if I'm wrong) in the pancreas, which secretes insulin when blood glucose concentration is high and glucagon when blood glucose concentration is low. Insulin and glucagon travels through the bloodstream into the liver, where excess glucose is converted into glycogen or storage with the help of insulin, or where stored glycogen is converted into glucose with the help of glucagon. This brings the blood glucose concentration back to norm levels and maintains the internal environment of the body.

When water potential of blood deviates from norm:
When water potential is too low:
When water potential in the blood is too low, it stimulates the hypothalamus which sends nerve signals to the pituitary gland to secrete excess ADH* (anti-diuretic hormone). ADH causes the cells in the walls of the collecting duct in the nephron to become more permeable to water, hence causing more water to be selectively reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which thus increases the water potential of the blood. The water potential of the blood is restored to the norm and the internal environment of the body is maintained.

When water potential is too high:
When water potential in the blood is too high, it stimulates the hypothalamus which sends nerve signals to the pituitary gland to secrete less ADH* (anti-diuretic hormone). ADH causes the cells in the walls of the collecting duct in the nephron to become more permeable to water, hence decrease in ADH causes less water to be selectively reabsorbed into the bloodstream, which thus decreases the water potential of the blood. The water potential of the blood is restored to the norm and the internal environment of the body is maintained.

*Note that ADH will always be secreted, it just depends if more or less is being secreted.


When body temperature becomes too high:
(Became lazy so I'm putting this in point form)
**Receptor: Hypothalamus**
-Sweat glands become more active, thus sweat is secreted and heat will be lost through evaporation of water in the sweat 
-The shunt vessels in the arterioles will undergo vasoconstriction while the capillaries near the skin surface will vasodilate, hence more blood is transported to the surface of the skin and heat loss will occur through conduction, convection and radiation.
-The body will also reduce its metabolic reactions to prevent heat from being released within the body. (I will add on to this)

When body temperature becomes too low:
-Sweat glands become less active, less sweat is secreted to prevent excess heat loss through evaporation of water in sweat.
-The shunt vessels in the arterioles will undergo vasodilation, while the capillaries near the skin surface will vasoconstriction, this prevents transportation of blood near skin surface as well as excess heat loss through skin surface by conduction, convection and radiation.
-The body will also increase its rate of metabolic reactions to release heat to keep the body warm.

Digestion:
Enzymes in saliva:
Salivary amylase
(Converts starch to maltose)

Enzymes in stomach:
Pepsin
(Digests proteins)

Digestion in Duodenum:
Bile: Secreted by the gallbladder, produced by the liver and emulsifies fats into small fat droplets

Pancreatic juice: Trypsin (Digests proteins), pancreatic amylase and pancreatic lipase (Digests fats into fatty acids and glycerol

In the Ileum:
Absorption of digested food substances

In the Large Intestine:
Absorption of water and other mineral salts

Intestinal juice: Maltase (Digests maltose into glucose), intestinal lipase and peptidase (Digests peptides into amino acids)

932,[O levels] Combined Sci(Phy/Chem) to A Level Phys & Chem?? Is that even possible?,"As i visited CJC's open house, I was quite bummed out when I realised i had to do either H2 Physics/Chemistry instead of doing both Physics and Chemistry for PCME because i took O Level (Phy/Chem). This implied that I had to take H2 Econs which i did not had an eye for because Econs is a completely new subject to me and i have not learnt it in Sec Sch so for me,it would be ideal for me to take it at H1 Level

Although i wanted to go to ASRJC because they gave me the opportunity to take PCME, my parents encouraged me to go to CJC instead because of my religion and that i would gain a deeper understanding of my faith there.

Anyways, it was a huge risk for me to take. I did not have any seniors in CJC who were in the same situation as me (i.e Combined Sci to A Level Science) so i did not have much guidance as to whether CJC was strict in allowing only people who took Pure Science to take A Level Science Subjects. In my mind, i was ready to take on having a combination with PCME but H2 Econs and H1 Phy/Chem.

>Readiness Tests

So as I was admitted to CJC,during Orientation, I was so blessed and grateful that they have readiness tests for those who did not take Additional Math to take H2 Math and those with combined science to take either H2 Phys or Chem or both and so I had to surely take those tests. The tests were just revision of O Level content. So when the results came, i shrieked in excitement to find out that I've passed both Chemistry and Physics readiness test and topping the Physics test so I was able to take PCME. (To take the readiness tests, i think you'll have to score a distinction for your combined Science to take A Level Sci or Emath if you want to take h2 Math)

1 weeks into JC, there was this constant fear of doubt and fear. Will i be left out from the rest our my class (In terms of Academic wise)? and can I catch up quickly without any knowledge of Pure Sci topics? Can I cope with all the stress here in JC? There were people saying online like on Reddit comparing the level of difficulty of the subjects from to 10 where Combined Science is 1 while Pure Science is 2, and A Level Chemistry is 10... That really gave me the chills. 

As weeks go by, we did tests and all and surprisingly I managed to do well for both Physics and Chemistry for Mid Years and Promos and eventually i've realised that although i was behind the rest of my classmates, they've mentioned that they forgot their pure science topics so it was like as if we were on the same level. Although there were some topics that I was not sure of (e.g Transformers in Pure Phy & Eletcrolysis,Activation Energy in Pure Chem) because they weren't tested in Combined Sci, I took the initiative to learn more about these topics and build the concrete understanding for them.

&#x200B;

>Tips (previously took Comb Sci(Phy/Chem) to A Level Phy & Chem):

\- During the Holidays after O Levels,if you're planning to go to JC, take the initiative to learn more about the pure science topics because they can be very helpful in your A Level content. A Level Chemistry has a topic on Electrochemistry that builds on the foundation of Electrolysis while for Physics has a topic on Alternating Current which has Transformers as one of its subtopics.

\- Consult your teachers about your answers. Know why you wrote your answers in that way and know why it is wrong. When consulting with the teachers, they can point out the misconception that you previously had. In this way, you know that you won't have to repeat your answers again 

\- Don't ever lose sight of your goal. If you feel like giving up,remember why you started taking A Level Science (Or Arts) Subjects. Although you may be at a disadvantage, this does not give you the excuse to be failing your tests. Instead, find ways that you can do to catch up. Watch YouTube videos to clarify understanding or consult your teachers

All in all, for those out there who aspire to be like me (From Comb(Sci/Phy) to Alevel Science), I wish you all the best for O Levels!

942,"[O levels] “Withdrawal symptoms"" after finishing most papers","Many of you may have heard of withdrawal symptoms after one has stopped drinking alcohol, stopped doing drugs or smoking. 

I now have 1 week until my paper 1 for physics and chemistry and I have decided to pick up my PS4 after 3 months. The feeling I got when I turned on my console was the same feeling of looking at homework as a primary school kid. I stopped playing after like 5 minutes due to my brain going into overdrive telling me to stop and study and my entire body feeling itchy and I also felt very irritable. 

Holding the controller in my hand is the most unnatural and disgusting feeling I ever felt even though I fucking love video games. Why I labeled this as “withdrawal symptoms"" is due the similar symptoms. This is the first time I have stopped studying in almost 2 and a half months and I study almost 5 hours a day. Today was the first time I stopped in a while and felt this. To really test if this was something like a withdrawal, I went to my room and did some MCQ papers and 4 hours flew by. I did not feel any dread or boredom while doing the papers, hell I even felt happy and energetic.

Did o level really fuck up my brain to the point I hate the things I love and love the things I hate? Or is this just a one time thing? To give you context I used to study 5 hrs a day before my CT or Exams but only like 2 days before. O level was the exception. I am also able to play games 5 hrs a day. I don't really have a in-between and although this may make me seem like some top school student flexing, no I'm not. I go to a normal neighborhood school and get slightly above average grades all the time. What have I become, I became the very thing I sworn to destroy.

944,[O LEVELS] JIAYOUS GUYS,"This post isn't about any of the exams that have already taken place/are going to take place in the near future, but just to hopefully serve as a source of motivation for all those taking Os right now. While I might just be a stranger to yall, I just know that all of you have got this in the bag!! 

I too was an O Level candidate just like you exactly 4 years ago, facing the same situation, experiencing the exact same feelings. After every exam, I would be mentally exhausted, practically all my brainpower consumed by the papers I had just completed. However, reading this subreddit after the papers never failed to uplift my mood and give me an energy boost. I wasnt one of the brightest students around, and my L1R5 was in the double digits even up till prelims. I thought i had no chance whatsoever of getting into the JC of my choice, but when my O level results came out, I actually made it in! Here i was, just an average student, somehow succeeding in meeting my goals. The point of all this ramble is that if I can do it, why can't you?

 I'm rooting for all of you this exam season, REST WELL EAT WELL SLEEP WELL AND GET THOSE A1s YOU DESERVE.

947,[A levels] Advice on study scheldue for J1,"Hello I’m currently a J1 and having just been through CTs, I realised how screwed I am, how much I’ve been playing around for the past few months & how serious JC actually is. 

As such I really want to make a change to my studying habits & stuff but I’m really curious how you seniors have done it? The content for the JC curriculum seems so much and seeing how i have only been through CTs and how stressed I’ve already been, I really wonder is there a more productive way to go about studying? 

For me, prior to CB, after coming home, I would be so tired (I reach home earliest around 4.30pm) that I would either sleep, eat, or use my phone and the only time I actually get to study will be on the weekends where I woudlnt be that productive as well.

So for seniors/current J1s who have managed their time well without burning may I know how a typical day of studying after coming back from school & on the weekends should look like? Any additional advice for balancing my own mental health along the process is also greatly appreciated (My stress and anxiety has been an all time high ever since CTs started and I can blame myself for not starting earlier but now I’m really stressing about how much more stressful studying for the A levels would be....) 

(Really any other advice on jc in general is appreciated I feel really lost rn :()

Also! I take BCMG which requires lots of memorising & a habit/problem i have is that I only memorise content around 2 weeks before exam & ik this is not sustainable in the long run so for seniors who had to memorise so much content, hwo did you manage to without cramping last minute & also being able to retain most of the content?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hljw7v/a_levels_advice_on_study_scheldue_for_j1/,True,2020-07-06 01:32:22
948,[UNI] [POLY] Poly to oxbridge?,"Hi, currently Y3 poly student studying engineering with a GPA of 3.895. Probably graduating with GPA of around 3.93.

I think I have a pretty decent portfolio in CS. I got around 5 months of experience working doing blockchain development for a startup and built a decent portfolio from my work there. Currently working on an FYP involving deep learning based computer vision applications. Also held some leadership roles in Poly CCA's. Holding a poly government scholarship and would intern in that sector some time in the future.

I plan to study computer science in Oxbridge. Their admission requirements are super strict and only regards A levels for Singaporean students. A poly diploma is completely disregarded by them. I plan to take AP Calc BC, CS, and Stats, together with SAT's to get on board the admission requirements for US citizens. Would that be enough to be considered for admission?

What are the chances of me entering Oxbridge given my current standings? Oxbridge is said to care a lot on academics and interest in the field. Is what I have enough? Is it even possible for this university path? How can I better prepare myself and my portfolio to stand a better chance?

954,"[O Levels] big anxiety right now over result collection day :""(","Ever since Os ended, I still have yet to overcome the trauma associated with it & lately I've been sleeping fitfully ever since deathday was announced to be on 11 Jan, having had nightmares about my results ever since.

I would like to put out a disclaimer that we all have different expectations for our results and what might seem bad to you might be good to me, and vice versa. I'm speaking in all veracity from my viewpoint and I don't have the intention of showing off whatsoever if it seemed that way. 

Firstly, I would like to address my individual subjects and the level of trauma I had from them after sitting for them at Os. 

English: Having been a straight A1 student since Secondary One, English has always been my strongest subject. I would constantly top my class and sometimes my cohort. To be honest, I would credit this to the fact that my Secondary School is a SAP school and the English Department wasn't the best. However, this still stoked and inflated my overly large ego to the point where I would neglect my TYS and not do them at all if I weren't forced to do them by my teacher. I went in feeling pretty confident and came out feeling like shit. Stupid jackass penguins and the summary left me drained. Informal SW was my weakest kind of SW and I felt like shit after it :"") LC was trash because istg the last speaker was literally rapping the passage. Achieved A1 in prelims, would be absolutely destroyed if I got anything lower than that. 
Trauma level: 8.5/10, would not recommend. 

EMath: Seemingly doable, but so did it seem to everyone else. Lost a few marks here and there and knowing how prone I am to carelessness, probably lost more. Did my TYS like crazy, did Topical Qns and over ten other school papers. Achieved A1 for prelims, would be pretty crushed if I obtained anything lower. 
Trauma level: 6.5/10, the rating increased incremently after seeing how the vast majority found it easy.

AMath: lol good joke SEAB now take back the Alevel paper and give us the real Olevel Paper
DJDJDJDJDDJD Amath felt like all bad things coalesced into one: the breaking up of a favourite band, having a bird drop feces on you and missing the bus only for the next one to come in 20 minutes. 
Worst part is that I mugged TYS twice, did all the other school papers and NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR IT. Lost 30+ marks from each paper respectively. I could have taken the paper in secondary three and it would still have yielded the same results. A1 for prelims, would be a miracle to get a B3. 
Trauma level: incomprehensible, Error 404, had nightmares which are still recurring to this very day. 

SS/EGEOG: SS is absolutely the worst thing ever invented and I really want SEAB to know that instead of it educating me on Singapore issues, it served as a nice one-hour naptime twice weekly. Failed my whole way through it until prelims (miraculously passed). EGeog, on the other hand, is the best thing to ever exist. It came effortlessly to me because I found it so interesting and I didn't need to memorise anything because it just plopped itself in my head on its own. However, both decided to fuck me over and tested the ONLY chapters that I didn't study for, namely the goddamn tsunami???? warning system. like I STUDIED THE WHOLE GEOGRAPHY TEXTBOOK BUT THAT LAME SHIT AND YOU SJSKDJDDKND!!!!! Achieved A1 in prelims, hopefully A1 in Os. Would be pretty devasted if I didn't. 
Trauma level: 8.5/10, was pretty traumatic such that I couldn't remember shit after stepping outside of the examination room. 

Malay Special Programme: Eh, was fine I guess??? I'm scared as FUCK for LC and Oral because when it comes to Malay, I'm suddenly hard of hearing and unable to speak without a stutter. Paper One was funny bc I wrote a really exaggerated composition and laughed at my two braincells after that, whilst Paper Two was alright I guess? A1 in prelims, hopefully A1 as well in Os because I literally studied for Malay every. single. day. 
Trauma level: 4/10, because I'm still scarred from LC. 

Chemistry: The superior science, and I maintained that stance until Os. Practical was kinda shit, paper 2 was okay but everyone was claiming that they would get fUlL mArKs but paper 1 had me dead inside. It was the last paper and prior to that, I had two other papers in the morning so I was pretty brain dead when P1 came along. Really sad because I would only ever lose 3-4 marks for it but I'm sure I lost a heck lot during Os. Couldn't bring myself to check the answers thereafter, just felt awful and numb. A2 for prelims, hopefully A2 for Os. 
Trauma level: 8/10, mild insomnia after it because of how mentally exhausting it was.

Physics: Aha and here I present to you, the bane of my existence. Tis a subject that I am unable to use brute memory work and hence have suffered through it for four years. Till this day I am unable to comprehend why I took it for Os. Might have been the claim that yOu hAvE mOre JoB opPorTunItieS!1!1! but the suffering AINT IT MAN. Mugged my ass off for it, felt that it was alright after Os but I made lots of dumb mistakes lmao. A2 for prelims, hoping for an A1 through sheer positivity.
Trauma level: 6.5/10, only got this far due to hard work and definitely not my school's pathetic excuse of a Physics department. But my Sec 4 Physics teacher was really kind and helpful in clarifying my dumb questions so I'm really grateful, thanks cher😔

note: took Chinese during June so its not talked about here.

In all, Os was pretty traumatic and I would rate it an overall 9/10 on the trauma scale. Wouldn't do it again, wouldn't recommend it the SLIGHTEST. SEAB lowkey did us dirty but :"") I would like to once again reiterate that I have NO INTENTION OF BRAGGING if it seemed to be the case because what I'm saying is all subjectively said from me, with all the expectations and hopes. We all wish to do well and I hope you can understand that. 

To all result-takers on Monday, I hope that we all will achieve our desired results and be accepted into our dream course. Stay strong, everyone! Till then, I shall be unable to sleep well and suffer from random bouts of anxiety and overthinking. Thank you for reading :-)

955,[O Levels] honestly expecting to do really badly,"During the holidays I was quite chill, didn't think much about the results (honestly completely forgot about them). After the papers, I already knew I wouldn't get into the course that I wanted in poly, (which was 8 points the last time I checked) but I guess it didn't really register to me until yesterday? I like to push things to the back of my mind and attempt to pretend it's not happening until it hits me last minute. I know I'm not gonna fail (touch wood la) but my mind has been so set on that one course that I don't really know how to feel when I don't get in. Obviously I did consider other poly courses which are similar, but I know despite that I'll still be very disappointed in myself.

956,[A Levels] Mental health is important too!!!!!,"This post is not just for my A Level peeps, but to everyone who is taking their national exams whether it be this year or the years to come! 

Studies in psychology have shown that the state of our mental health also has varying effects on our physical health. It has been proven that poor mental health is detrimental to our physical health as it disrupts certain processes such as our circadian rhythm, ability to concentrate, and for girls sometimes, your menstrual cycle as well. 

Now you might be thinking, how can one mitigate or even better, avoid these issues? 

Firstly, it is the small things that count. Getting sufficient sleep, proper meals, talking to people, doing the things that you enjoy, engaging in sports perhaps. Such activities can help to lower our emotional stress level. Endocrinologists have observed that such activities help to increase the amount of serotonin that is being released by the brain, which also has an effect on the amount of melatonin in our body, as melatonin is derived from serotonin via the pineal gland. How does getting proper meals affect this? Well, serotonin is derived from tryptophan, an amino acid that is commonly found in food that is high in protein such as dairy, poultry, and nuts. As illustrated, these simple things actually have an impact on both our physical and mental health.

Secondly, study hard, but study smart. You have heard this many times before, but do we stop to wonder what does this actually mean? Example: You take H2 Chem and you need to study for A Levels which tests heavily on Organic Chemistry. So what you do is take out all the notes and start memorising it, only to then get overwhelmed by the overload of information and have a mental breakdown at 3am when your paper is at 8am. What went wrong? What is the issue here? Well, simply put, pure memory can make you pass, but it will not bring you far in life. So what are other alternative approaches that reap better results? One method would be to incorporate understanding rather than simply memorising; instead of memorising all the different synthesis routes, understand the mechanisms via the 5 main types (FRS, Electrophilic, Nucleophilic, Redox, Hydrolysis) and derive everything from there. It seems like a lot but it actually crams down everything you need to know into sub-categories. Just like a computer, when you need to retrieve this information from your brain, rather than searching for 1 file in 1000, you can browse the different folders until you get the information you need. Another method of studying which I definitely recommend is also known as [Active Recall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqTOBqDQcmY&ab_channel=DanielTamago). This video should explain it better than I can. Back to how this can affect your mental health, the lower frequency of overloading your brain with information helps by reducing the amount of cortisol (stress hormone) in your body, which then has other positive effects on your mental and physical health. 

Lastly, take things with a pinch of salt and not be too hard on oneself. We know how it feels, having done our best for a paper only to get back that disgusting U grade. Been there, done that. However, it is how we deal with these setbacks that determines who comes out as a ""winner"". Picture this, 2 people take a H2 Maths paper and both got 20% for it. However, one student cries all day and beats himself up over this setback, while the other books that consult with his tutor, identifies the holes in his understanding of the content, and treats this assessment as a gauge as to how he is doing in school. The next test comes around and student A still does badly, whereas student B improves and actually passes the paper this time. Both students are similar in which both had the same initial result. However, the students are different in how they deal with it, what they do about it, and their overall outlook towards their circumstances. One sees it as a death penalty dooming them to fail for eternity, while the other sees it as an opportunity to learn and do better next time. Although not really much on mental and physical health, it is our attitude towards learning and towards life that determines the kind of outcome we see. I get it, things might suck now, but change is the only constant. Things do change for better and for worse, and when it is when you at your lowest that you are open to the biggest change. 

Anyway congratulations to you if you made it this far into my dissertation without accidentally grabbing twenty winks. For my N and O Level peeps, congrats on having finished your exams, and to my A Level peeps, atb for the rest of your papers. 

tl;dr take care of yourself :))",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ju8k5a/a_levels_mental_health_is_important_too/,True,2020-11-15 12:20:46

958,[O levels] Practical fail (joke),"hello guys, just your below average scum back again to talk about my failures in life ✨ (it’s more of just a self deprecating story that I hope will make you smile and be like: hah at least i’m not them)

rmb the last time where I accidentally said good afternoon in english to the higher chinese examiners for oral?
in o levels?

that’s not the end!!

in my schools prelim for chemistry we had 3 experiments to carry out so let’s get started shall we?

q1) standard titration
this one q standard and ngl it went q smoothly
until the calculations
but
my moles are absolute dog shit and I couldn’t even understand the question soooo

[-4]

q2) simple QA tests!
simple right? easy right? yeaaaaaa 
no.
I formed my KI solution and my small brain tilted the test tube to check out the colour

you know that meme when you ask ppl who’s holding a beverage for the time and they check their watch

ya you can kinda guess what happened here

and since the KI solution had iodine, it met the lovely maiden called my practical worksheet and the yellow solution changed in colour to a blue black solution :)

the remaining yellow solution spilled everywhere and stained the table and plastic bags hehe

so now I have a dark blue, wet, stained worksheet

[-paper (by your own stupidity)]

shock,disbelief, amazed by my high iq.

whatever q3 let’s go no time to cry lmaoooo

this one was very long and tedious and I kept forgetting to start the stopwatch and kept having to repeat the experiment over and over and over again

10 minutes left, all I had to do is draw the graph. easy right? simple right? fun right? I surprisingly have a lot of time despite my-

wrong.

my last solution overshot the heated temperature by 10 degrees so I had to wait for it to cool so I went back to try my titration qns again

7 minutes. ok still possible

hey,,, do you ever get that feeling.? that sick twisted feeling in your stomach that you’re forgetting something so very much important???

planning.

oh shit oh fuck god dammit as I finished the thing you’re supposed to give 15 minutes for in 5 minutes

2 minutes!!!
graph!!!!
mess!!!!


hah
[-5]

all in all, it went wrong in every possible way and i’m just hoping I can pass at this point that itself would be a miracle

for now ima try to keep my head held up and just mug for paper 1 and 2 and forget this mess
i’m just hoping nothing similar will happen in bio

anyways jiayous to all the sacrificial lambs going for prelims!! wishing you guys all the best and remember! to! sleep!

**BE EXCITED** about the company. It’s may sound trivial, but it makes a huge difference. Be excited to interview. Be excited to learn about what your interviewer does and the prospect of getting to work with them. Tell them how much you like the people you met and that you dig the culture. There's a difference between faking it and being genuinely excited. I know it may be hard to get yourself excited after countless failures/rejections but put yourself in the shoes of the interviewer. How would you perceive someone if they look dreary and disinterested to you even before they have entered the company?

Interviewing is surprisingly like dating. Your interviewer is disproportionately more likely to be excited about you if you’re excited about them. That positivity will make them more want to work with you, and even go to bat for you when it comes decision time.

Not only that, but excitement is a signal that you actually want to do the job they’re hiring you for, and that you’re going to work your ass off to do it well. If your interview performance was anywhere near the edge, your excitement may end up pushing you over the finish line.

You’ll likely be interviewing at different companies, but you should always talk about what makes this company unique and captivating. If you’re not sure, just ask your interviewers—what makes them love working here? You can then reflect back that answer.

At the same time, you don’t want to appear desperate. I liked using the phrase “looking for good mutual fit.” You want to be **discriminating**, but you also want to seem **winnable** if they make you the right offer. If you seem outright disinterested in the company, then they probably won’t want to make you an offer even if you pass their technical bar.

Companies do vary significantly in culture. But a lot of “culture fit” really just comes down to a simple question: would your interviewers actually want to be your colleague?

It’s much easier for them to say yes if you sound excited. So make it easy for them.

963,[JC] The dating scene in respective jcs,"hi there ! just a little mental intrusion i had earlier on . It probably is the case that every jc has a different threshold / norm of how impassioned the relationships happening within the student body usually are and should be . 
i was wondering what the dating cultures are like in the different jcs and to what degree / stage (s) of relationships are the people in the various jcs familiar with . Any particular stories et cetera . This is a discursive thread so do share hahahahha !

964,[RANT] hung up over my incompetency,"TW: elements of mental illness 

Sigh I just need an avenue for me to vent out my frustrations as I still find myself dwelling over yesterday's paper. Anyway, I am extremely displeased with my h2 lit ppr 1 performance yesterday and I feel as though the A grade has slipped through the grasp of my fingers.
I'll admit, throughout my JC journey, i have been struggling with my mental health, having been hospitalised or stay at home for weeks in a row (total attendance since last year will amount to approx 30%). Yet, I've always found relief through literature. In fact, it was the only reason why i continued my JC journey despite having to withdraw back in 2018 due to my suicide attempt just before promos, thus, in order to have a better chance at scoring for my a lvls MT and PW, as well as an opportunity to focus more on my mental health, i withdrew before applying back again in 2019.
Anyway, these 2 years didn't really get better (in fact, my mental health actually got worse, developing ED, OCD and copious changes to the dosage and medications and visits to the hospital-  i literally felt like a guinea pig)

Back to the topic at hand: h2 literature. I absolutely love literature and have done well for it - consistently 2nd in my secondary school, narrowly losing to my good friend (we always studied and worked together) with essays scoring at least 20/25 and comfortably bagging an A1 in O levels. Moving forward to JC, despite my lack of attendance etc, i still managed to be the top few in my JC and consistently got distinctions for my essays. Undoubtedly, literature is my strength in terms of academics, and also a drive for me to carry on with life. Though, like a double edged sword, i place extreme pressure on myself when it comes to taking exams for h2 lit as well- A levels is not an exception.

As ridiculous as this might sound, i amount my worth to my ability to do literature; if i didn't get a distinction for lit, there is no need for my existence. To give you further insights to my distorted mind, i saw literature as my only pillar of support for my sanity, and thus, should i embarrass myself by not performing well in lit for As, i am utterly worthless and a disappointment to the world.

Well, i didn't do well yesterday. I think my set texts were relatively okay (even though it was a laughable 2 bp each... For me at least). My disappointment and anger towards myself primarily lies in the poem comparison. I chose the set of poems on rain and wrote utter nonsense. I managed to write only 1 weak paragraph on something unsound, illogical and questionable. Referencing the rubrics, i think the highest mark i can attain through that pathetic piece of writing should be a meek 9 marks. Thus, to secure an A, my paper 3 would have to score a minimum of 20 marks for each section and i am ultimately overthinking and doubting my abilities at this point. The more i think about this, the more helpless I feel. I can't seem to move forward even though i know i have to sharpen my mind for the next battle. I feel like im drowning in the river of melancholy and i absolutely despise my ""woe is me"" attitude yet i cant seem to crawl out of this ditch I'm currently stuck in. 

Ugh. If you've reached till the end i apologise for the lengthy whining but i just feel so defeated and i cant seem to pick myself up. Success stories would be of great help right now. Has anyone done relatively well for most sections or wrote 1 bp only for a question and still managed to pull through? :-(

965,"[University] I want to study medical robotics, any local unis with courses who have these specialisations aside from SUTD?","Hi there!

Reaching out to seniors in uni courses that fit the above or anyone with leads on where are the best courses to go into for this field? I applied to SUTD (and ofc other unis, but this was the closest) last year but unsuccessful :( was rly looking forward to joining their courses in medtech and into EPD..

I'm aware that for these sort of things, you need a post-grad after getting into one of the many branches of engineering (BME, ME or EEE) for undergrad. Even having to GO overseas for the more clinical ones (like @ La Trobe University) but I'm leaning more into development/research. With COVID19, I'm not sure if going overseas is a thing for me (not to mention the debt) -> Edit: I'm okay with overseas options if it starts 2021, but just not sure yet financially

My background is as follows:

\- Education: Polytechnic diploma with 3.7+ GPA (with merit but honestly dont know if this means much?) in computing but my work/'volunteer' experience dealt more with electronics and hardware.- Experience: I'm in an internship doing general robotics software ( and am hoping to secure a place to shadow at a hospital to make sure I understand what I'm getting into). Had 1 R&D stint and 1 Exec role in a SME tech company- Personal interest: Both curiosity and very sob grandfather story but am legit that going into this has a personal stake for me (and actually involves my grandfather).- Test scores: Going to retake SATs in Physics (610), Bio (650) and Math 2 (610). Math 1 is at 700. My scores are really bad I know...- Not a lot left :(

Thanks so much in advance for going through this word-vomit and stay safe yall\~

EDIT:   
Here's my current list from the recommendations I'm getting.   
Thanks, everyone! Still open to suggestions:

It’ll really help me out a lot? I’m really clueless For bio and as a sec 5 student, getting this eae chance would be an honest safety net.

967,[poly] eae interviews,"i found out that its the selection period for eae interviews and i thought that what im about to share next might help some of you. i was once an o level student too, so i know how it feels like participating in eae. unlike yall i was unable to seek help online because i found out about this app in october last year lol and i really dont want anyone to make the same mistakes as i did / go through the same thing :(


Before the interview

not tryna scare yall but for some courses (especially engineering and design courses), students are required to sit for an aptitude test before attending the interview. questions asked in the test are general knowledge related, maybe there are some questions related to the course, however the test isnt that difficult, and its just to see how much knowledge do you actually have. please note that sitting for the test does not mean you'll get called for interview, unless the test is given right before your interview slot.


Interview

interview slots are usually informed through emails and SMS, so do check your inbox regularly !! you might not be offered all 3 choices or any of your choices at all. after the selection period is over, you will not receive anymore emails / messages to call you for interview.

Attire

school uniform will do ! if not you can wear smart casual, but to be safe, just stick to uniform ah nothing could go wrong. 

Interview questions

ah yes, most commonly asked question i see on reddit regarding eae. to break it down, here are some common questions interviewers ask the students.

- why did you choose this course?
- what do you know about this course?
- what are your plans after graduation?
- why should we accept you?
- why is this your ___ choice?

other questions that may be asked:

- what are your strengths?
- what are your weaknesses and how you overcome them?
- tell me more about yourself
- why did you choose this particular poly?


Items in portfolio

another common question asked, but heres what to include in your portfolio.

- cca records
- testimonials (request from your tcrs)
- certificates (both academic and non academic related)

i hope i didnt miss out anything, but if i did, do let me know so i can update this post. hopefully it helped some of you reading this. if you can have any questions, you can just message m or comment them below, im quite responsive (especially at night lol) and i'll try my best to help ! i applied to sci courses and early childhood for eae last year so if anyone applied to these courses, feel free to ask me anything !


dont stress yourself over eae. i did that last year and i suffered from frequent headaches...not fun at all. all the best !!

971,[A Levels] How to Study for H2 History Content Syllabus Code 9752 (Abridged),"*\[UPDATE MAY 18, 2020\]*

*GP Spectrum is undergoing a massive change in our business strategy, which is: No business, I'M GONNA GIVE OUT FREE NOTES. That said, in order to streamline my content, I have shifted my blog post to another website. Simply click on that link given below in ""post"".*

Hello!

Students that offer H2 History in the A Levels often struggle with knowing how to study for it. In addition, given that this subject is pretty niche (relatively speaking), the amount of available options for you guys to seek help for this are painfully limited. Speaking as someone who took H2 History in the A Levels, and as a full-time tutor who teaches this subject, I'd like to take some time to leave some quick tips for you guys. This post will be an abridged version of what I've already previously covered in my blog. Without further ado, let's jump in!

There are three main things we need to be aware of in order to ""study"" for H2 History content - building knowledge, understanding the knowledge, and practice. At the same time, we also need to be strategic about the way that we study the content, because, let's face it, there's just too much of it. ***(DON'T TAKE THIS AS AN EXCUSE TO SLACK OFF THOUGH.)*** To that end, here are the main points that you'd want to take note of:

**#1a Create cheat sheets**

Cheat sheets are great for giving you quick pointers for the content. I tend to create cheat sheets that cover the most commonly used examples in essays, as well as the quick explanations for each example that I may potentially use. In short, it's meant to keep the notes concise for you!

**#1b Create concept maps**

Concept maps are basically cheat sheets manifested in a visual form. They give you clarity with regards to how the pieces of the H2 History content answer essay questions, especially if you're someone who is a lot more inclined towards visual representations of data or facts.

**#2 Internalise the frameworks for understanding the H2 History Content**

I firmly believe in learning > studying. This is especially important for H2 History, given that if you do not even understand the content in the first place, you would not know where to fit the examples into whichever frameworks that you'd use to answer essay questions. I'm pretty sure most schools do provide frameworks for each theme/topic in H2 History for you guys, so I'd highly recommend you guys to pay attention and to ask questions.

**#3 Practice essay questions**

You don't get better at something without practice. Simple. Also, through practice, you'll soon realise that the questions are often framed in a manner that is consistent with the aforementioned frameworks.

**#4 Don't be afraid to let go**

We can't study everything, especially when you have 2 or 3 more H2 subjects. So, be realistic about the amount of studying you're going to do. But please, please, please don't misconstrue this as ""an excuse to slack off"". It's not.

So yeah, I hope this helps all you H2 History students, even a little. Please feel free to PM me if you have any questions, or you could simply check out my blog [post](http://thediscourse.sg/education/how-to-study-h2-history/).

All the best for your studies! :\^>",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fhu2ai/a_levels_how_to_study_for_h2_history_content/,True,2020-03-13 20:29:14
972,[JC] CJC: MY EXPERIENCE AS A SCIENCE STREAM STUDENT,"I've been seeing a lot of questions, opinions and facts about CJC and though I've not completed my journery there, I'd like to inform you of how my school life and some of my peers' school life has been like since joining the school. 
I came from a neighborhood sec school where the culture was actually quite comforting and the students studied a lot. My teachers in secondary would stay back for hours to tutor and guide me for Os. They'd even encourage me to ask more questions and engage with them more. However, when I came to CJC I experienced a sort of... shock. I take the science scream (BCME) and my biology teacher would greytick me, never reply my texts and put off consultations so much that I'd had given up. I wanted to ask another teacher to aid me but I had to ask my initial bio teacher if I could ask another teacher. Some other bio & many physics teachers did the same too for my peers. As for maths, it's one of my weaker subjects and unfortunately, the teachers never really helped me. The teachers don't push you. Some of them even seem cold at certain instances. I must say my chem teacher is okay, some of my other peers and seniors have incredible chem teachers so if you're lucky you'd get one too. However, I think the practical lessons are rather little for us to hone our skills at least. Don't even make me begin with the notes. They're okay but c'mon, I've seen JPJCs notes for bio and they're wayyy better imo. It definitely is outdated as we know it and rather wordy and can be hard to study with sometimes. You'll be wishing for other alternatives. My friends in ignite programme are doing okay but have the same qualms as I do and ignite teachers do teach non ignite classes. Some of my friends in the programme say it's actually a really good programme and that it's something they look forward to, others say it's rather overrated. I'm not in the programme so I can't say for sure but overall it doesn't seemtoo bad. Facilities wise, honestly it doesn't really impact the quality of education? The facitilites are good for an old building. There were some leaky aircons that would sometimes decide to work as heaters but I'm sure that's been fixed now. The toilets are vvvvvv clean to the point you can almost always smell the detergent. 
As for your social life, well you'll definitely make friends and have your fair share of fun and meet a lot of people. However, there is some truth to the toxic culture there and there's a clear hierarchy with A LOT of social climbers. It's very daunting to even go to school sometimes tbvh with all the drama that goes on and all they social issues, if you do choose to come here, choose your friends wisely. 
Teacher-parent communication kinda sucks, I have AA due to an anxiety disorder and most of the teachers were nonchalant about my condition and often forgot about me HAHAHAHA. My parents wanted to know a little more about the teachers to also calm themselves down about who my teachers are and if I'm safe there since CJC is an hour away from my home and my teachers didn't really seem so keen on talking to them it was as if they wanted it over with. 
Overall I had an okay experience in CJC, okay, I lie, my experience wasn't good. But I've tried to make the best out of it and am just going to study and utilize resources from my friends who study in other JCs as well as maximize what CJC has given me to do well for As. I do wish I'd chosen another school :(",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kx2hvi/jc_cjc_my_experience_as_a_science_stream_student/,True,2021-01-15 01:36:09

976,[Rant] y’all can do it!!!,"the first week of o’s just ended, and we all have the weekend to prepare for the rest of the papers. 

you might think,

“sigh, i’m fcked already”
“i’m sure my grades cmi”
“what if i don’t get into the poly/jc i want?”
“what if i really am a failure?”

you’re not fcked, you’re not a failure. 
don’t let these exams dictate who you are as a person, because you’re so much more than your grades. 

sure, you might have been failing your subs, you might be pressuring yourself to meet your expectations, or even worse, you might need to meet your parents’ expectations. 

that doesn’t mean you are a failure if you can’t meet said expectations. think about you.
think about how the people around you appreciate the way you make them laugh. or how you’re there to lend a shoulder to cry on. how good of a singer/artist/dancer/etc you are. how passionate you are about the things that you care about. these all define you. not your grades, not the amount of information you can regurgitate during an exam, but your ability to coexist with others and grow as a person.

my english teacher always used to tell us, “i’ll be proud of a student who didn’t do well but is a good person rather than a top scorer who doesn’t know how to be a decent human being”

yes, grades will determine where you can go to some extent, but what’s meant to be will happen. even if you can’t get into the school of your choice, think of it as a challenge that life is presenting to you. let’s say you wanted to go to a particular course in poly, but your aggregate doesn’t allow you to go. there are still other options, and maybe you’re not so excited about those but who knows? maybe you’ll enjoy it more than you would than if you went to your desired course! 

it’s not the end of the world, and this is only one of the many hurdles we will face. think of it as an opportunity to grow stronger, so don’t give up now, okay? 

we’ve all come this far :)

From poor time management to being dumbstruck in the planning question and eventually abandoning it I have completed ruined my prospects of doing decently for A levels or so I think. Practical already accounts for 20 percent of the whole grade. I am assuming that I'll get somewhere close to 0 to 10 marks for the whole paper.The worst part is I studied so meticulously practicing all kinds of energetics, kinetics you name it. This is the last chance I got and I messed it up. Made me realise that no matter how much effort I put in it just never pays off. I do have diagnosed depression and anxiety and the idea of failing A levels again torments me and makes me feel like a burden to my parents who already invested so much in me. All this pressure makes me want to simply not exist. If I see the failing U or S grades in my A level report card I am thinking of ending my life. Some of you may think it's an exaggeration but imagine fucking up your life not once but twice. It's not about the grades , my inability to get through As would cost me my dream which was the only thing that kept me alive. How do I find purpose again? While all my classmates are happily enjoying the blissful moments of uni life I'm here spending time rewriting As with no idea if I'll make it thr second time. I dont what to do.

979,[A Levels] Motivation for As: It is not too late :),"Hello Everyone!

I know everyone is currently stressed about As and some of you here might be thinking that it is impossible to jump grades following your prelims and CT2 results. I am here to tell you that is still possible at this stage.

For context: I have been getting Us all year round for all my mathematics exams and my papers are considered difficult to score in, but within the span of one month of sheer grit and effort, I have been able to do it. Not an A, a B, but whatever it is, I focus on my own growth and development. That is the first step in this process of improvement.

Next, my methods for studying math: 

Firstly, I reviewed all the topics I was weak in, and reattempted all the tutorial/self-practice questions. Review is not reading the math questions, review is attempting the lecture questions again and progressing to tutorial and practice questions. Remember, it is not how much you do, but how well you do it. Math is about applying basic concepts to complex scenarios, relook the chapters, and understand the fundamentals well. That is the crux of math. (1-2 Weeks)

Next, given that I layered my revision for math, I kept revisiting the old topics again in this span of 1-2 weeks. With that, I formed a solid base to progress from, and I attempted the prelims papers for my school. Now, at this stage, I know what those of you who feel discouraged might think. I can't do it, why attempt the math papers when I don't even understand the basics. No. Form the basics with your topical revision, and then you have to take that leap of faith. It seems difficult to progress from the first step, but trust yourself. You are often your biggest stumbling block. Have faith, you can and will do it. You managed to make it to this point, that means you have succeeded in your own ways. (1\~)

Given how prelim papers are considered difficult relative to As, what your prelims grades mean is -2 grades off from your As grade. Remember, Cambridge papers are easier than your prelims, do not be discouraged, it is still achievable at this point. Reminder, there are still four weeks. No, don't tell yourself you ONLY have four weeks. You STILL have four weeks. It can make a difference. I have seniors who jumped from S to A from prelims to As. It is not impossible.

Trust yourself, that is the first step. Even if it seems hard, trust yourself. Tell yourself everyday, you can do it. Because I know you can, you will do it. It is not too late. You just have to take the first step. All the best :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j5ch6t/a_levels_motivation_for_as_it_is_not_too_late/,True,2020-10-05 19:36:49

983,[Poly] Using a MacBook in Polytechnic,"Hi everyone! I have followed this sub since sec 4 so I'm excited that I get to (finally) contribute here. I've gotten a lot of messages and questions from juniors about what kind of laptop they should get for their course of study in Polytechnic – in particular, whether they should get a MacBook or Windows laptop. This post aims to help you make your decision with the following:

* Why consider using a Mac
* Checking the hardware requirements for your specific course
* Using Windows for Mac-recommended courses
* Using Mac for non Mac-recommended courses

From there, I also have the following to help with your purchase decision, should you choose to get a Mac:

* Personal recommendation on which Mac model to get
* Where to buy your Mac
* Purchasing process (buying from Apple)
* Additional links

This post is from my perspective as a Mac user of 9 years that happens to be in a Design course, and is just to share some of my thoughts. It should NOT be taken as your one and only source and justification to your parents as to why you “should” and “must” get a Mac ya!!

\----

&#x200B;

**WHY CONSIDER USING A MAC**

Macs (in my opinion) are some of the better-built and higher quality laptops out there, which makes them more durable. In the event that your Mac is somehow damaged (cracked display, water damage, etc.), the customer support from Apple is always good (I've never had a bad experience in my 9 years as an Apple customer). When you want to take it in for service at one of Apple’s two stores – Apple Orchard Road or Apple Jewel Changi Airport – you can make an appointment through the Apple Support app on iOS, or do it from the Support tab on the Apple website. On top of that, there are plenty of Apple Authorised Service Providers (AASPs) around that are able to help you as well.

If you already use an iPhone, there’s a huge added incentive of already being in the Apple ecosystem: AirDrop! You can just tap to transfer images or files from your iPhone to your Mac (and vice versa). You won’t know how convenient AirDrop is until you’ve used it in a difficult situation. Some people buy Macs purely for the “Apple appeal”, since Macs are expensive and I guess people can flex like “oh eh I have a Mac” with it and complete their ""collection"" of Apple devices.

Battery life on Macs are pretty great, and the hardware is pretty awesome too (the backlit keyboard looks amazing). You can get it in a sleek Space Grey colour, or stick to the common Silver colour. In the case of the Air, you can get it in a swanky Gold colour. The 13-inch Macs are very portable and sit nicely on your lap (it’s a laptop after all). On the topic of size and portability, it is easy to do work on the train ride to school, since the Mac is not huge and will not impede into the personal space of the person next to you.

For charging, the power converter is attached right to the charging head, so it’s pretty bulky and hence fits into most (but not all) charging ports around your school. The charger will NOT fit into outdoor sockets with rain protection caps, no matter how hard you try to jam the charger in. As for sockets in the floor, it varies depending on the size of the cutout. Props to you if you bring your Mac on a family holiday! On airplanes, the charger should have little problems fitting into the sockets between the seats in Economy and Premium Economy class, regardless of the airline. However, the charger might not fit into all Business or First class power sockets, depending on how the respective airline has positioned the socket.

At this point, if your parents (or you) are willing to fork out at (the very very) least S$1,757 for a Mac and are still considering getting one, read on! Or if you're just interested to find out more, feel free to read on too!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**CHECKING HARDWARE REQUIREMENTS**

Before you make your own decision on whether to get a Windows laptop or Mac, be sure to check the recommended notebook hardware requirements that are listed by your respective polytechnic! Click on the links below for the ones on SP and NP. I couldn’t really find the course-specific requirements on the NYP, RP, or TP pages (sorry!).

NP ([http://www2.np.edu.sg/notebook/models/Pages/whobuys.aspx](http://www2.np.edu.sg/notebook/models/Pages/whobuys.aspx))

SP ([https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/it-services/it-support](https://www.sp.edu.sg/sp/student-services/it-services/it-support))

If your course does require a Mac, great! Skip on to ""Which Mac to get"". The next section will talk about using Windows for Mac-recommended courses. If your course recommends that you use a Windows laptop but you’re still keen on knowing whether you should get a Mac for your course, skip ahead to “Using Mac for non Mac-recommended courses”.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**USING WINDOWS FOR MAC-RECOMMENDED COURSES**

*Since \*most\* design courses require Macs, this section will be more design-focused.*

It definitely is possible to get through with a Windows laptop in a course that recommends Mac, since the keyboard shortcuts and program layouts are largely the same. However, many Windows laptops  fall behind when it comes to their displays. Here are some of my own thoughts when it comes to using a Windows laptop in a Mac course:

A lot of Windows laptops have an sRGB display, while the Mac (in particular the MacBook Pro) has a wide-gamut DCI-P3 display. The big difference between sRGB and DCI-P3 is that DCI-P3 is able to reproduce a wider colour range than sRGB. Having the wider colour range allows you to have a better idea or representation on how your work will look like before you send it for printing. It’s not a huge thing, but having that wider range helps.

Windows laptops (from what I’ve seen) are more likely to have matte displays, while the Mac has a glossy display. The difference between matte and glossy is the coating that is applied to the screen. In a normal studio or classroom setting, these displays will look pretty similar to one another. Glossy displays like the one on the Mac have more vivid colour and contrast, so colour appears more intense and saturated, and blacks appear deeper. The con of having this glossy display is that fingerprints show up easily when you touch the display (the Mac is not touchscreen!), and will therefore result in you having to wipe down your Mac’s display with a microfibre cloth occasionally. Matte screens have an anti-glare coating applied to them, which makes them easier to see in a bright room or in direct sunlight. The downside of the matte coating is that colours appeal a bit more dull, so previewing your work on the display may be less accurate.

Battery life on Windows varies from laptop to laptop, but if you want to do work and don’t have a power socket nearby, battery life on the Mac (with a light to medium workload in Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign) can be from 3 up to 5 hours, which is pretty good I guess. If you want to do work on the train ride to school, the 13-inch Macs are very portable and sit quite well (won’t slide) on your lap. Again, the power converter for the charger is attached right to the charger head, so it may not fit into all power sockets (e.g. those have rain protection caps or sockets in the floor).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**USING MAC FOR NON MAC-RECOMMENDED COURSES**

This is a bit risky, and it’s important to research and find out what programs your course may require you to run. Not all Windows-based applications and software are compatible with macOS. You can get around this problem by using a virtual machine or using Bootcamp, but even with these solutions... you should still make sure that the Mac’s specs meet the course recommendation first. If you’re still persistent on getting a Mac...

Speaking in the case of SP, it is not recommended at all to get a Mac if you’re from School of Architecture & The Built Environment (ABE), School of Computing (SoC), School of Electrical & Electronic Engineering (EEE), School of Mechanical & Aeronautical Engineering (MAE), or Diploma in Marine Engineering (DMR) under Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA).

If you’re from School of Business (SB), School of Chemical and Life Sciences (CLS) or Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA), you technically *can* use a Mac, unless if your specific course requires specialised software. In that case, the specialised software is probably made only for Windows machines so… maybe you shouldn’t get the Mac.

If you’re from the Media, Arts and Design (MAD) School… CONGRATULATIONS! Welcome to the land of Macs. All the courses here (with the exception of DVEMG, DDA, and DGDD) require Macs. In the case of DADP, feel free to decide on whatever laptop you want to use! \^\_\^ For 'O' and 'N' level students, PLEASE remember that you should **not** put a MAD course in one of your 12 choices just because you get to use a Mac.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**WHICH MAC TO GET**

Congratulations and thank you for making it this far into the post! You’ve decided “yes, I want to use a Mac for my course”, and we have now come to the difficult part: which Mac should I get?

Again in the case of School of Business (SB), School of Chemical and Life Sciences (CLS) and Singapore Maritime Academy (SMA) in SP, if you’ve checked that there is NO specialised software that you have to use, the base model of the MacBook Air with 128GB of storage should do you just fine for your 3 years. If you want to double the storage to 256GB, be ready to spend $300 more. AppleCare+ for the MacBook Air is $308. If you buy the base model with 128GB or storage and AppleCare+, this brings the total cost to $1,757.

In MAD, the MacBook Pro is just better because it has more power to handle the workloads in the school. In DMC and DTVM, the MacBook Air has insufficient processing power for video editing. For DMAT, the MacBook Pro has more ports so you can plug more stuff in at once. You can just about survive with the MacBook Air in DXCD, buuuut you should really get the MacBook Pro because it displays a much wider colour gamut.

I think this roughly translates to other polytechnics as well, but make sure to check with your seniors on what laptops you can use.

As for the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the extra space you have on the screen helps, but honestly... it's not necessary and shouldn't be at the top of your list, since we're still students and the 16-inch Mac is super expensive.

Accessories like cases and keyboard covers are relatively inexpensive (generally less than $12 each). You can see some of my recommendations for must-have items like adaptors in the “Additional Links” section.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**PURCHASING PROCESS**

You can choose to buy your Mac through the school supplier (JK Technology for all 5 polytechnics) or directly from Apple. Here are some things to take note of before we get into purchasing:

The only incentive of buying your Mac from the school supplier is the freebies that they throw in, which includes a 13-inch Laptop Sleeve, Logitech M337 Bluetooth Mouse, Logitech H111 Stereo Headset, and USB-C to Multiport Adaptor. The freebies which you probably won’t use (sleeve: just keep the Mac in your bag, mouse: the trackpad on the Mac is so good you don’t need a mouse, headset: people already have their own earpiece or AirPods) are honestly okay to forgo, so just buy from Apple. In the case of the adaptor, you can get USB-C adaptors on Shopee or Lazada for cheap (<$10).

&#x200B;

>If you don't care about choosing your own Mac colour and are okay with receiving stuff you will probably never use, just buy from the school supplier haha.

&#x200B;

One of my classmates had to wait upwards of 1 month after she placed her order with the school supplier to receive her Mac. If you order directly from Apple, you can do free next-day delivery (if the model is in stock) or walk in and have in-store collection at Apple Orchard Road or Apple Jewel Changi Airport. Apple shows whether the specific Mac model you’re looking for is in stock, and does not limit the colour options for your Mac The school supplier’s inventory of Macs consists of ONLY Space Grey models. If you want a Mac that is not Space Grey, you’re out of luck if you’re purchasing from the school supplier. In addition, purchasing from Apple opens the full range of custom configurations that are available to you, compared to the pre-set configurations by the school supplier.

By the way, the following points in the [Sales Policies](https://www.apple.com/sg_edu_4911/shop/browse/open/salespolicies/edu) (yes, read the Sales Policies!) make you eligible for the student pricing on your Mac:

&#x200B;

>Universities, Polytechnics, Junior Colleges and Institutes of Technical Education - Parents purchasing on behalf of their child, who is a student currently attending or accepted into a into a Universities, Polytechnics, Junior Colleges and Institutes of Technical Education in Singapore, are eligible to purchase.

&#x200B;

>Faculty, Staff and Students purchasing from the Apple Store for Education Individuals will be allowed to purchase the following quantities of product per academic school year:  
>  
>Desktop: One (1) may be purchased per academic year  
>  
>Mac mini: One (1) may be purchased per academic year  
>  
>Notebook: One (1) may be purchased per academic year  
>  
>iPad: Two (2) may be purchased per academic year  
>  
>Software: A maximum of two (2) per software title may be purchased per academic year  
>  
>Apple TV: There is no limit on the quantity of Apple TV purchases per academic year  
>  
>iPod: There is no limit on the quantity of iPod purchases per academic year

&#x200B;

Okay, buying from Apple! Scroll to the bottom of [https://www.apple.com/sg/](https://www.apple.com/sg/) and click on “Shop for University”. From there, you’re able to purchase up to 1 MacBook and 2 iPads with student pricing per academic year. Depending on the Mac that you are purchasing, AppleCare+ can start from $308.

Although AppleCare+ is an expensive add-on, it's something that you should invest in, since it is the extended warranty (lasts for 3 years) and covers more stuff. You'll use the Mac for your 3 years in school, so it works to around $100 per year.

Once you're all set, should you choose to pick your Mac up in an Apple Store, a Genius (those in the blue shirts) are more than willing to guide you through the setup process of your Mac. There are also Today at Apple sessions that are available for you to attend if you want to learn more about your Mac.

987,[O Levels] Dear O Level graduates,"Hey O Level graduates! Congratulations on completing this milestone in your life. I know that it was a difficult period to study in with home-based learning and various measures put in place which affected school life so no matter the outcome of your results, I really think you should give yourself a pat on the back for simply persevering through that entire ordeal. 

Even if you might not believe me right now, trust me when I say that the school you enter, more specifically JC, does not matter in the long run and what is actually of concern is your personal character and drive to improve. 

To those who envy their peers who have performed better, having access to higher-tiered schools with fantastic distinction rates and being upset with yourself for not achieving that standard, please do not beat yourself up over it. Reflect upon your journey and utilise this energy to fuel your drive to better yourself. No matter which school you enter, use the O Level experience as a reminder to start clarifying your doubts earlier or to perhaps curb your gaming addiction. Your educational journey does not simply end here after one major examination and there will always be moments for you to show your growth as a person from this tough experience. 

Furthermore, just because a person had entered a top-tier JC does not completely guarantee his success in the A Levels. Many like to focus on the glitz and glamour from these schools, the majority who excelled during the examinations without realising that there are still individuals that slip through the cracks. 

A close friend of mine did quite well for his O Level examinations and managed to secure a spot in a top-tier JC and I had imagined that his intelligence will allow him to have a smooth time there. However, once lessons began, he became complacent and soon realised that he was falling behind his classmates with each lecture, tutorial and practical. This pace of learning was too fast for him to handle and he was constantly pressured by his peers who were not only keeping afloat, but also thriving whilst he struggled to keep up with his studies alongside his CCA commitments. 

In the end for his A Levels, his inability to stay on track accompanied by the pressure to perform well given his school’s academic record ultimately caused him to crumble under the pressure. Since the first examination, he was constantly leaving the examination hall feeling dejected, constantly berating himself for making careless mistakes or for not writing things properly. Despite my constant encouragement for him to look past the papers and continue pressing forward, I think that the expectations placed on him had already taken such a major toll that he was not in the right frame of mind during the examinations. Come results day, whilst seemingly everyone else was celebrating their almost perfect Rank Points, he had to face the reality that he had only achieved a score of 72.5. Whilst this might be a good score to some, coming from such a prestigious school, it was a very hard pill for him to swallow.

On the other hand, another personal friend of mine who did not perform up to their expectations, had to enter a mid-tier JC which he had no intention of going beforehand. I remember him being really devastated over his results and felt like the future was very bleak for him. However, once school officially started, he was consistent in his work and soon forgot about his O Level score, focussing instead on doing well for A Levels and sure enough, he did obtain 85 Rank Points and was among the top 10% of his school.

The reason why I decided to share this personal experience I had witnessed first hand is not to criticise my friend for doing poorly, but because I do not want anyone to feel like they are doomed to perform poorly for the rest of their lives and that there is no way they can recover from their situation, that they will only be mediocre at best. 

From this, I hope you realise that a better school does not always guarantee better results and just because you are not from a higher-tiered JC as you did not do as spectacularly for O Levels, it does not guarantee that history will repeat itself. Everyone will be taking that same national examination again during A Levels no matter what JC you come from and thus, there is always an opportunity for you to bounce back and enter the course of your dreams. 

Even for those who are not taking the JC route and are receiving backlash from their family or friends who perceive other educational pathways as less than ideal, do realise that it is only a matter of time before everyone’s educational journeys go their separate ways and hence the idea about not following the pack should not necessarily be worrisome. No matter which educational institute you end up in, I hope you have the confidence and grit to excel in whichever course you choose as what truly matters is yourself and your own individual effort moving forward from this point onwards. Your level of success would ultimately be determined by your willingness to look past your current grades and the effort you put into improving yourself, be it adopting a more positive attitude towards life or stopping yourself from procrastinating all the time. 

Life is like an examination with countless problems to solve. However, what most people fail to realise is that everyone is given a different question paper. Hence, everyone actually faces different challenges throughout their lifetime and the way to solve them is to not necessarily follow others, but to listen to one’s own heart and forge one’s own path. Do not feel pressured to commit to something or go to a school you feel uncomfortable with just because others have told you to go to the very best school your score allows for. Remember that there are a myriad of factors to account for and to always trust your gut. 

If you would like more help with your choice of school and more about school life, I do have a blog about it but I think self-promotion is not allowed on this Reddit page so if you are interested, do PM me about it. I also have not updated it in a long while because of NS being such a hassle but I hope my previous posts would help guide your decision. 

I feel like this post was a little rambly but I hope you guys found it useful! I think the bottom line is that you are ultimately in charge of your own fate. It is not wrong to be currently caught up with your emotions as it is completely understandable. However, what is of greater importance is what you can gain from this experience which would help you in the next chapter of your life.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kx3ebb/o_levels_dear_o_level_graduates/,True,2021-01-15 02:49:27

992,[A levels] Prelims to A level journey,"Hello fellow j2s and seniors! Its the holy post-prelim and pre-A level stretch and i hope you guys could give any honest opinions as to how yall studied (especially seniors who managed to do very well and beyond their expectations / J2s with stellar prelim grades). My school's prelim papers were out-of-the-ordinary hard as compared to past years and the cohourt generally didn't show motivating results. Unfortunately for my class, my teachers have started to give up on us (not answering questions when we text them, not replying to requests for consults, telling us on our faces that we need to buck up but not really guiding us per se) so we're quite shortchanged that way. Any advices on the most effective study methods? Number of hours of study per day? Prelims really showed my shortcomings here and there in terms of both content and exam skills, do yall suggest working on the gaps over the next few days or chionging prelim papers? Also is TYS still useful to study cos some teachers say it's useless to do it whereas others say it is an A level Bible. Help out a peer :D

a long read but thanks for staying till the end :')))))))))",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/izaq1s/a_levels_prelims_to_a_level_journey/,True,2020-09-25 17:56:17
993,[o levels] mother tongue result expectations,"Hi everyone ! Tomorrow the big day! Honestly I studied really hard for chinese (breathed and lived on chinese) during CB so I pulled my grades 7 grades up from D7 for zuo wen to A1 during mock exams. But after, the chinese paper I can’t help but feel demoralised. The paper was the hardest paper I ever did lol. So my theory is that this year for those people who score really ok will do extremely well. (It will be easy to get A1) But for ppl like me who just memorise and last min studied wont do that well because of how hard the paper is Anyways, this is just pure speculation haha. I honestly think I’m going to get D7-B4 because I was rushing through the paper and my hand writing is illegible and plus I screwed up oral real bad told the teacher that I went Sentosa to tiao luo (jump of the building). But anyways good luck to everyone ! And feel free to comment your own grade expectations :)))",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/if0yky/o_levels_mother_tongue_result_expectations/,True,2020-08-24 02:28:06
994,[O Levels] Scoring for English Paper 1,"Hi all, I have some questions to the English pros out there. 

edit: I usually gravitate towards writing discursive/argumentative 
&#x200B;

In my internal school exams, I usually get a 20-22 mark for both my situation and continuous writing. I try to vary my sentence structures, add in relevant vocab etc. 

But I seem to never be able to escape from the 20-22 range of marks. I really want an A1 for EL Olelvels and because my P2 is not the best, I really want to maximise my marks in P1. 

For those of you who have scored mid 20s and high 20s, do you have any tips for writing? 

If you don't mind, it would be great if you could send me a sample essay, because I really would like to see how others write their essays, since I'm usually only reading my own essays over and over again. Any tips or any essays you could show me would be truly appreciated! 

&#x200B;

Thanks for your help and jia you to all students preparing for Os rn!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ie9skx/o_levels_scoring_for_english_paper_1/,True,2020-08-22 17:37:54
995,[a levels] some feelings about school closure,"firstly, i wanna say a huge kudos and THANKYOU to all frontline workers and my heart really goes out to all that are adversely affected by this covid situation ,,,, but i'm just really sad that schools have to be closed bc i genuinely LOVE going to school and being with my classmates and just study and play and idk i rlly have so much fun in school every single day and now i'm gonna stuck at home for a month :( 

i know it's rlly for the best and i know this is necessary to control the situation at hand but god i'm really sad and i will miss school so freaking much zzz i was thinking of how much i'll miss the canteen food and i also realized how much this situation must suck for those aunties and uncles, their livelihoods depend on us and now we're not even there to buy from them :/

ok and right i'm also damn angry at some of my friends for going out to go window shopping or eat or hangout or wtv and like isit that hard to just not go out for these few months ???? window shop what shop, there's a pandemic going on yall zzzzz why are yall like this urghrgh i'm actually annoyed 

also, as a j2, i'm so freaking worried for A levels man. with myes being cancelled and a month (or even more) of our curriculum being moved online, idk it scares me that we'll all end up being underprepared for the A levels and it's just so scary, especially with the loss of practical sessions in school :/ but i also don't want practicals to be cancelled because if not later they make paper 4 100% planning and PLANNING IS SO HARD zz no but seriously tho, i'm rlly scared for A levels now woops hopefully i have the discipline to use all the free time to study ahahaha 

i know i'm actually blessed to be in singapore where our government is actually making great decisions and putting all of our wellbeing first + we rlly do have the resources to fight this virus and people are DYING and i probably shouldn't complain so much woops

anyways hope everyone stays safe and healthy and we'll get thru this ok! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fu76xd/a_levels_some_feelings_about_school_closure/,True,2020-04-04 04:03:18
996,[Uni] [SIT Physio] Summary of Kira Interview,"Hi everyone, I'm applying for SIT Physiotherapy, and just completed the video interview. Want to share a few things as I've seen people asking about it.

1. I only got 2 practice questions. I thought that they would randomly pick 2 from a pool and change everytime i refresh, but nope, only those 2 practice questions.

2. They say that there are 18 questions, but a few questions just provide the background for upcoming questions, so overall its less.

3. There is a 30min essay component!!! I did not expect this and was not prepared for this...

4. The questions at the start gave u a TOUGH situation and asked how u will react to this situation, what u feel etc.

5. In the middle there are 2 roleplay sessions. The roleplay basically gives you the background brief, and then shows a video of a person roleplaying(for me he was acting like an elderly citizen complaining to me abt an issue). You have to stay in character to your role and try to reply to him, and then in a next video they will ask you on your thoughts abt the situation. As a physio applicant, I mainly got more social services-type questions.

6. The questions at the end of the interview ask the generic questions, e.g. what are your strengths and weakness, why should we pick you, etc.

7. Some ppl have said there was a 2min time for u to write more things at the end, mine wasnt written but was a video for u to say anything for qn 18.

8. Generally the questions gave you 10 seconds to prepare your response, and then 2 mins for your reply.

9. I completed the entire thing in 1h15min.

10. They also ask you on why you picked your specific course vs other healthcare roles offered by SIT.


All the best for everyone!!! Remember the deadline by this Sunday!!!!
